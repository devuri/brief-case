certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08351.Argued October 14, 2009Decided December 8, 2009
Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property used to facilitate a drug crime, permits police to seize the property without a warrant, and allows the State to keep the property nearly five months before beginning judicial forfeiture proceedings.  Respondents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law, brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal Due Process Clause.  The District Court dismissed the case based on Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from that precedent and ruled for respondents.  This Court granted certiorari to review the  Seventh Circuits due process determination, but at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property disputes between the parties had been resolved.
Held:
1.The case is moot.  The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal questions only in the context of actual Cases or Controversies, Art. III, 2, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of review, not just when the complaint is filed, Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401.  Here there is no longer any actual controversy regarding ownership or possession of the underlying property.  There is no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit within the category of cases that are capable of repetition while evading review.  Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.  Pp. 46.


2.The judgment below is vacated.  In moot cases, this Court normally vacates the lower court judgment, which clears the path for relitigation of the issues and preserves the rights of the parties, while prejudicing none by a preliminary decision.  United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 40.  Where mootness is the result of settlement rather than happenstance, however, the losing party forfeits the equitable remedy of vacatur.  U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25.  This case more closely resembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.  In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by voluntarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation.  Here, the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no significant role in the termination of plaintiffs state-court forfeiture proceedings.  Plaintiffs forfeiture cases took place with no procedural link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substantive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Courts knowledge, no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.  This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary practice and order vacatur.  Pp. 69.

08-559|"E. K. McDANIEL, WARDEN, etal., PETITIONERS v.
TROY BROWN
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
[January 11, 2010]
Per Curiam.

In Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), we held that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a federal judge finds that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 324.  A Nevada jury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented included DNA evidence matching respondents DNA profile.  Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a DNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal District Court applied the Jackson standard and granted the writ.  A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.  Brown v. Farwell, 525 F.3d 787 (CA9 2008).  We granted certiorari to consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.  Because the trial record includes both the DNA evidence and other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that they clearly did.
I

Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe was brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer.  Respondent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime.  During and since his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his innocence.[Footnote 1]  He was, however, admittedly intoxicated when the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the following morning he told a friend he wished that he could remember what did go on or what went on.  App. 309.
Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in the same trailer park.  Their brother Trent and his wife Raquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the street from Jane Does.  Both Troy and Trent were acquainted with Jane Does family; Troy had visited Jane Does trailer several times.  Jane did not know Travis.  The evening of the attack, Janes mother, Pam, took Jane to Raquel and Trents trailer to babysit while the three adults went out for about an hour.  Raquel and Trent returned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about 9:30 p.m.  Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and playing pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock Lounge.  Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister were home alone because he answered the phone at
the bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that
evening.


Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by beer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself while he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at about 12:15 a.m.  Jane called her mother to report the rape at approximately 1 a.m.  Although it would have taken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home, Troy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m.  He was wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin jacket, and boots.  Two witnesses saw a man dressed in dark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stumbling in the road between the two trailers shortly after
1 a.m.


The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and Jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.  When asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned both Troy and his brother Trent.  Several days after the rape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent flowers attacked her.  It was Trent and Raquel who had sent her flowers, not Troy.  She was unable to identify Troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could not identify her assailant at trial.  The night of the rape, however, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a black jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch.  She also vividly remembered that the man stunk real, real bad of cologne, or some beer or puke or something.  Id., at 172173.


Some evidence besides Janes inconsistent identification did not inculpate Troy.  Jane testified that she thought she had bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite marks on his hands when examined by a police officer approximately four hours after the attack.  Jane stated that her assailants jacket had a zipper (Troys did not) and that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not).  Additionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy left the Peacock and when Pam received Janes call reporting the rape.  The witnesses who saw a man stumbling between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on the back of the jacket, but Troys jacket had a yellow and orange logo.  Finally, because Jane thought she had left a night light on when she went to bed, the police suspected the assailant had turned off the light.  The only usable fingerprint taken from the light did not match Troys and the police did not find Troys fingerprints in the trailer.


Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy.  The police recovered semen from Janes underwear and from the rape kit.  The States expert, Renee Romero, tested the former and determined that the DNA matched Troys and that the probability another person from the general population would share the same DNA (the random match probability) was only 1 in 3,000,000.  Troys counsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he consulted with an expert in advance who found no problems with Romeros test procedures.  At some time before sentencing, Troys family had additional DNA testing done.  That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit matched Troys DNA, with a random match probability of 1 in 10,000.


The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years.[Footnote 2]  On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court considered Troys claim that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, analyzing whether the jury, acting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troys] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 285, 934 P.2d 235, 241 (1997) (per curiam).  The court rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt as follows:
Testimony indicated that Troy left the bar around 12:15 a.m., that Troy lived relatively close to the bar, and that Troy lived very close to Jane Doe.  Troy had enough time to get from the bar to Jane Does house and to assault Jane Doe before she made the telephone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.  While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her description of his clothing was similar to what Troy was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy had been drinking beer and had vomited several times that night.  Furthermore, testimony indicated that Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave him enough time to assault Jane Doe.  Additionally, [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resembling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling in the road near Jane Does house at 1:05 a.m.  Troy also washed his pants and shirt when he got home, arguably to remove the blood evidence from his clothes.  Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that semen collected from Jane Does underwear matched Troys and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1 in 10,000 people had matching DNA).  Ibid., 934 P.2d, at 241242.

Respondent also argued on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether the DNA evidence was reliable.  The court found respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and concluded there was no plain error in the trial courts failure to conduct a hearing.  Id., at 284, 934 P.2d, at 241.


In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief, claiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the DNA evidence.  He argued that there were a number of foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that if trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been excluded or at least its importance diminished.  He noted that because trial counsel totally failed to challenge the DNA evidence in the case, counsel failed to preserve valid issues for appeal.  App. 1101.  The state postconviction court denied relief, id., at 14891499, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed, id., at 15001506.


Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition, claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on the sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme Courts rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, Jackson.  He did not bring a typical Jackson claim, however.  Rather than argue that the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial was constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of the evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analysis.  In particular, he argued that Romeros testimony related to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreliable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized the random match probability and misstated the probability of a DNA match among his brothers.  Absent that testimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence to convict him.


In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Romeros testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared by Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology (Mueller Report).  The District Court supplemented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it was not presented to any state court, because the thesis of the report was argued during post-conviction.  Brown v. Farwell, No. 3:03cv00712PMPVPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *5, n.2 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).


Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set aside the unreliable DNA testimony and held that without the DNA evidence a reasonable doubt would exist in the mind of any rational trier of fact.  Id., at *7.  The court granted respondent habeas relief on his Jackson claim.[Footnote 3]


The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  525 F.3d 787.  The court held the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied Jackson.  525 F.3d, at 798; see 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals first reasoned the admission of Romeros unreliable and misleading testimony violated Troys due process rights, so the District Court was correct to exclude it.  525 F.3d, at 797.  It then weighed the sufficiency of the remaining evidence, including the District Courts catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies that would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troys guilt in the mind of any rational juror.  Ibid.  In light of the stark conflicts in the evidence and the States concession that there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA evidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable for the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondents insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.  Id., at 798.


We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider two questions: the proper standard of review for a Jackson claim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may rely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the reliability of trial evidence.
II

Respondents claim has now crystallized into a claim about the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testimony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the Mueller Report.  The Mueller Report does not challenge Romeros qualifications as an expert or the validity of any of the tests that she performed.  Mueller instead contends that Romero committed the so-called prosecutors fallacy and that she underestimated the probability of a DNA match between respondent and one of his brothers.
The prosecutors fallacy is the assumption that the random match probability is the same as the probability that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.  See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133 (1996) (Let P equal the probability of a match, given the evidence genotype.  The fallacy is to say that P is also the probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from someone other than the defendant).  In other words, if a juror is told the probability a member of the general population would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random match probability), and he takes that to mean there is only a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the prosecutors fallacy.  It is further error to equate source probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source of crime-scene DNA.  This faulty reasoning may result in an erroneous statement that, based on a random match probability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the defendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is guilty.


The Mueller Report does not dispute Romeros opinion that only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA profile as the rapist.  Mueller correctly points out, however, that some of Romeros testimonyas well as the prosecutors argumentsuggested that the evidence also established that there was only a .000033% chance that respondent was innocent.  The State concedes as much.  Brief for Petitioners 54.  For example, the prosecutor argued at closing the jury could be 99.999967 percent sure in this case.  App. 730.  And when the prosecutor asked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equating source probability with random match probability, whether it [would] be fair to say  that the chances that the DNA found in the pantiesthe semen in the pantiesand the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy Brown would be .000033, id., at 460, Romero ultimately agreed that it was not inaccurate to state it that way, id., at 461462.


Looking at Romeros testimony as a whole, though, she also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathematical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the percentage figure.  At the end of the colloquy about percentages, she answered affirmatively the courts question whether the percentage was the same math just expressed differently.  Id., at 462.  She pointed out that the probability a brother would match was greater than the random match probability, which also indicated to the jury that the random match probability is not the same as the likelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of the DNA.


The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romeros testimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more of Troys brothers DNA would match.  Romero testified there was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one brother would share the same DNA with another.  Id., at 469, 472.  When asked whether that change[s] at all with two brothers, she answered no.  Id., at 472.  According to Mueller, Romeros analysis was misleading in two respects.  First, she used an assumption regarding the parents under which siblings have the lowest chance of matching that is biologically possible, but even under this stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers matching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024 under her assumption).  Second, using the assumptions Mueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single sibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability that among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in 132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66.  Id., at 1583.


In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns are testimony equating random match probability with source probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood that one of Troys brothers would also match the DNA left at the scene.
III

Although we granted certiorari to review respondents Jackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of Appeals resolution of his claim under Jackson was in error.  See Brief for Respondent 23; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1.  Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals did not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead resolved the question whether admission of Romeros inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether that error was harmless.
Although both petitioners and respondent are now aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our review, the case is not moot because the parties continue to seek different relief from this Court.  Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).  Respondent primarily argues that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or remand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process claim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993).  The State, on the other hand, asks us to reverse.  Respondent and one amicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 2728, but we think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court of Appeals application of Jackson.  Cf. Pacific Bell, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).


Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the District Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of evaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35, and concedes the purpose of a Jackson analysis is to determine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in returning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it, not whether improper evidence violated due process, id., at 2.  There has been no suggestion that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of it was excluded.  Respondents concession thus disposes of his Jackson claim.  The concession is also clearly correct.  An appellate courts reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is in effect a determination that the governments case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.  Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988).  Because reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judgment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial.  See Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978).  To make the analogy complete between a reversal for insufficiency of the evidence and the trial courts granting a judgment of acquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial court, regardless whether that evidence was admitted erroneously, id., at 41.


Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted at trial when considering a Jackson claim.  Even if we set that concession aside, however, and assume that the Court of Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in the context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egregious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Courts rejection of respondents insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim involved an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, 28 U. S. C. 2254(d)(1).[Footnote 4]


Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it, the Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romeros testimony from that courts consideration.  The Report did not contest that the DNA evidence matched Troy.  That DNA evidence remains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the State concedes Romero overstated its probative value by failing to dispel the prosecutors fallacy.  And Muellers claim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underestimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers indicates that two experts do not agree with one another, not that Romeros estimates were unreliable.[Footnote 5]


Muellers opinion that the chance that among four brothers one or more would match is 1 in 66, App. 1583, is substantially different from Romeros estimate of a 1 in 6,500 chance that one brother would match.  But even if Romeros estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury verdict is not undermined.  First, the estimate that is more pertinent to this case is 1 in 132the probability of a match among two brothersbecause two of Troys four brothers lived in Utah.  Second, although Jane Doe mentioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby trailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were sober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.  Even under Muellers odds, a rational jury could consider the DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.


Furthermore, the Court of Appeals discussion of the non-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review that Jackson and 2254(d)(1) demand.  A federal habeas court can only set aside a state-court decision as an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, 2254(d)(1), if the state courts application of that law is objectively unreasonable, Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000).  And Jackson requires a reviewing court to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.  443 U. S., at 319.  Expressed more fully, this means a reviewing court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presumeeven if it does not affirmatively appear in the recordthat the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.  Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 330 (1995) (The Jackson standard  looks to whether there is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could support the conviction).  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, but the courts recitation of inconsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.


For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony regarding when Troy left the Peacock.  525 F.3d, at 797.  It is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one bartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy would have left the bar after the attack occurred.  Yet the jury could have credited a different bartenders testimony that Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m.  Resolving the conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have found that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant.  It is undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately upon returning home.  The court notes this is plausibly consistent with him being the assailant but also that he provided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.  Ibid.  Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed the clothes immediately to clean blood from them.


To be sure, the courts Jackson analysis relied substantially upon a concession made by the State in state postconviction proceedings that absent the DNA findings, there was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the crime.  App. 1180.  But that concession posited a situation in which there was no DNA evidence at all,[Footnote 6] not a situation in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA evidence were called into question.  In sum, the Court of Appeals analysis failed to preserve the factfinders role as weigher of the evidence by reviewing all of the evidence  in the light most favorable to the prosecution, Jackson, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the Nevada Supreme Courts resolution of the Jackson claim was objectively unreasonable.
IV

Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consideration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm on an alternative ground.  He contends the two errors in describing the statistical meaning of the DNA evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him due process of law.  Brief for Respondent 4.  Because the Ninth Circuit held that the admission of Romeros unreliable and misleading testimony violated [respondents] due process rights, 525 F.3d, at 797, and in respondents view merely applied Jackson (erroneously) to determine whether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the judgment below on the basis of what he calls his DNA due process claim, Brief for Respondent 35.
As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this claim, he would have to show that the state courts adjudication of the claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  The clearly established law he points us to is Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114 (1977), in which we held that when the police have used a suggestive eyewitness identification procedure, reliability is the linchpin in determining whether an eyewitness identification may be admissible, with reliability determined according to factors set out in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972).  Respondent argues that the admission of the inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite because the testimony was identification testimony, 432 U. S., at 114, was unnecessarily suggestive, id., at 113, and was unreliable.


Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for the very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Respondent did not present his new DNA due process claim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consistently argued that Romeros testimony should be excluded from the Jackson analysis simply because it was unreliable and that the due process violation occurred because the remaining evidence was insufficient to convict.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a ([Respondent] asserts  that the DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have been admitted at his trial.  If so, then,  the state presented insufficient evidence at trial to prove [respondent] guilty).  In the Ninth Circuit, too, respondent presented only his Jackson claim,[Footnote 7] and it is, at the least, unclear whether respondent presented his newly minted due process claim in the state courts.[Footnote 8]  Recognizing that his Jackson claim cannot prevail, respondent tries to rewrite his federal habeas petition.  His attempt comes too late, however, and he cannot now start over.
***

We have stated before that DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before.  District Attorneys Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).  Given the persuasiveness of such evidence in the eyes of the jury, it is important that it be presented in a fair and reliable manner.  The State acknowledges that Romero committed the prosecutors fallacy, Brief for Petitioners 54, and the Mueller Report suggests that Romeros testimony may have been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match with one of respondents brothers.  Regardless, ample DNA and non-DNA evidence in the record adduced at trial supported the jurys guilty verdict under Jackson, and we reject respondents last minute attempt to recast his claim under Brathwaite.  The Court of Appeals did not consider, however, the ineffective-assistance claims on which the District Court also granted respondent habeas relief.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
He denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that the police had found his fingerprints in Janes bedroom, and he even denied involvement when the sentencing judge told him that acceptance of responsibility would garner him leniency.
Under Nevada law at the time of the trial, the jury, rather than the judge, imposed the sentence for a sexual assault crime if it found the assault resulted in substantial bodily harm.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 200.366(3) (Michie 1992).  For an assault resulting in substantial bodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without the possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10 years.  200.366(2)(a).  The jury elected the more lenient sentence.  The judge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years on a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively.  The Nevada Supreme Court reversed Troys conviction for one count of child abuse on double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second sexual assault count.  Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 934 P. 2d 235 (1997) (per curiam).  On resentencing, the judge imposed the same sentence as before.
The District Court also granted habeas relief on respondents claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to his attorneys handling of the DNA evidence and failure to adequately investigate the victims stepfather as an alternative suspect.  Brown v. Farwell, No. 3:03cv00712PMPVPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *9*10 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).  The Court of Appeals did not consider those claims on appeal and they are not now before us.
The Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada Supreme Courts decision was contrary to Jackson.  The Court of Appeals held the Nevada Supreme Courts decision was contrary to Jackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a reasonable jury, not a rational one, and that assesses whether the jury could have been convinced of a defendants guilt, rather than whether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.  Brown v. Farwell, 525 F.3d 787, 794795 (CA9 2008).  It is of little moment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a reasonable jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than asking whether a rational one could be convinced of each element of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt unless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.
The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have criticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past.  See Brief for Petitioners 5354.  We need not pass on the relative credibility of the two experts because even assuming that Muellers estimate is correct, respondents claim fails.
The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which respondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the admissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of groundsincluding Romeros qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow the proper testing protocoland might have successfully excluded the DNA evidence altogether.  See App. 10991100.
The Court of Appeals did reason that Romeros testimony must be excluded from the Jackson analysis on due process grounds.  525 F.3d, at 797.  But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim respondent did make in his federal habeas petition under Jackson.  It is clear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to considerand did not pass uponthe question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a decision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), or any other clearly established law regarding due process other than Jackson.
The State contends the claim is either not exhausted or procedurally defaulted.  The State has objected from the beginning that respondent did not raise a due process claim regarding the reliability of the DNA evidence in state court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a183a.  Respondent consistently answered the States exhaustion objection by arguing he presented his Jackson claim in the Nevada Supreme Court.  See App. 15211526.  The Ninth Circuit held respondent exhausted his insufficiency claim.  525 F.3d, at 793.  The court had no occasion to consider whether respondent exhausted any due process claim other than his Jackson claim.

08-604|"UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD CO. v. BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND TRAINMEN GENERAL COMMITTEE OF ADJUSTMENT,
CENTRAL REGION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08604.Argued October 7, 2009Decided December 8, 2009
The Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful and efficient resolution of labor disputes.  As amended, the Act mandates arbitration of minor disputes before panels composed of two representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as tiebreaker.  Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610613.  To supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons representing labor and industry in equal numbers.  45 U. S.C. 153 First (a).  Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining agreement (hereinafter CBA), see 153 First (i), a stage known as on-property proceedings.  As a final prearbitration step, the parties must attempt settlement in conference between representatives of the carrier and the grievant-employee.  152 Second, Sixth.  The RLA contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences, but does not supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to conferences)  between the parties, 152 Sixth; in common practice the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation.  If the parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the NRAB.  153 First (i).  Submissions to the Board must include a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.  Ibid.  Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order on one or more stated grounds:failure  to comply with the requirements of [the RLA],  failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the divisions jurisdiction, or  fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order.  153 First (q).  Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in 153 First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process violations.


After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the CBA.  The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five disputes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration before the NRABs First Division.  Both parties filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.  Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the Boards governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to set forth all relevant, argumentative facts, 29 CFR 301.5(d), (e).  Just prior to the hearing, one of the arbitration panels industry representatives objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of conferencing.  The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection.  The referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing.  The Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected before the date set for argument.  The panel, in five identical decisions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction.  The record could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments.  The Union sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the Boards decision.  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the single question at issue was whether written documentation of the conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequisite in the statute or rules.  But instead of resting its decision on the Unions primary, statute-based argumentthat the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the casesit reversed on the ground that the NRABs proceedings were incompatible with due process.
Held:
1.The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Unions appeal under a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline.  This Court granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding 153 First (q)s limited grounds for review.  But so long as a respondent does not seek to modify the judgment below, true here, the respondent may rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment.  Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n.5.  The Seventh Circuit understood that the Union had pressed statutory and constitutional arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on a single question:is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?  Answering this single question in the negative, the Seventh Circuit effectively resolved the Unions core complaint.  Because nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the single question leaves no doubt about the Unions entitlement, in accord with 153 First (q), to vacation of the Boards orders.  Given this statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case.  Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here enables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over matters properly typed jurisdictional.  Pp.1012.


2.Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting and processing claims, 153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the Boards jurisdiction.  By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on the false premise that it lacked jurisdiction to hear them, the NRAB panel failed to conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction, 153 First (q).  Pp.1217.


(a)Not all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are  properly typed jurisdictional.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 510.  Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers to a tribunals power to hear a case, and can never be forfeited or waived. Id., at 514.  In contrast, a claim-processing rule does not reduce a tribunals adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456.  For example, this Court has held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393.  In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of 28 U. S.C. 2107(a)s time limitation for filing a notice of appeal.  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209211.  Here, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance prearbitration, attempt settlement in conference, is imposed on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation does not condition the Boards adjudicatory authority, which extends to all disputes between carriers and their employees growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions , Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting 153 First (i)).  When a CBAs grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the conference requirement is independent of the CBA process.  Rooted in 152, the RLAs [g]eneral duties section, and not moored to the NRABs [e]stablishment[,]  powers[,] and duties set out in 153 First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more jurisdictional than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable in Zipes.  And if the conference requirement is not jurisdictional, then failure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be of that genre.  And although the Carrier alleges that NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdictional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels jurisdiction, surely the panels themselves lack that authority.  Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter.  Pp.1215.


(b)Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to require, as a prerequisite to the NRABs exercise of jurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.  Instructions on party submissions are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules.  The Board itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a question in dispute, and when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented  data supporting the employees grievance, 29 CFR 301(d)evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties right to order for themselves the conference procedures they will follow.  See 45 U. S.C. 152 Sixth.  Pp.1617.
522 F.3d 746,  affirmed.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

08-678|"MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 08678.Argued October 5, 2009Decided December 8, 2009
When respondent Norman Carpenter informed the human resources department of his employer, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc., that the company employed undocumented immigrants, he was unaware that Mohawk stood accused in a pending class actionthe Williams caseof conspiring to drive down its legal employees wages by knowingly hiring undocumented workers.  Mohawk directed Carpenter to meet with the companys retained counsel in Williams, who allegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.  When he refused, Carpenter maintains in this unlawful termination suit, Mohawk fired him under false pretenses.  In granting Carpenters motion to compel Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with retained counsel and the companys termination decision, the District Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was protected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the Williams case.  The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawks appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that the District Courts ruling did not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, because a discovery order implicating the attorney-client privilege can be adequately reviewed on appeal from final judgment.  
Held:Disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.  Pp.413.
(a)Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.  28 U. S.C. 1291.  Final decisions encompass not only judgments that terminate an action, but also a small class of prejudgment orders that are collateral to an actions merits and too important to be denied immediate review, Cohen, supra, at 545546.  That small category includes only decisions that are  effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.  Swint v. Chambers County Commn, 514 U. S. 35, 42.  The decisive consideration in determining whether a right is effectively unreviewable is whether delaying review until the entry of final judgment would imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order.  Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S. 345, 352353.  In making this determination, the Court does not engage in an individualized jurisdictional inquiry, Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473, but focuses on the entire category to which a claim belongs, Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868.  If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can be adequately vindicated by other means, the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded, or a particular injustic[e] averted, does not provide a basis for 1291 jurisdiction.  Ibid.  Pp.46. 


(b)Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral order appeal, including postjudgment review.  Appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.  Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review apart from collateral order appeal.  First, a party may ask the district court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory appeal involving a controlling question of law the prompt resolution of which may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.  1292(b).  Second, in extraordinary circumstances where a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.  Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U. S. 367, 380.  Another option is for a party to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that, e.g., direc[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established, prohibi[t] the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or strik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.37(b)(2).  Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punishment.  See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n.11.  These established appellate review mechanisms not only provide assurances to clients and counsel about the security of their confidential communications; they also go a long way toward addressing Mohawks concern that, absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe hardship.  The limited benefits of applying the blunt, categorical instrument of 1291 collateral order appeal to privilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify the likely institutional costs, Digital Equipment, supra, at 883, including unduly delaying the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burdening the courts of appeals, cf. Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209.  Pp.612. 


(c)The admonition that the class of collaterally appealable orders must remain narrow and selective in its membership, Will, supra, at 350, has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, not expansion by court decision, as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable, Swint, supra, at 48.  Any further avenue for immediate appeal of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings should be furnished, if at all, through rulemaking, with the opportunity for full airing it provides.  Pp.1213.
541 F.3d 1048, affirmed.
Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined, and in which Thomas, J., joined, as to Part IIC.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can be adequately vindicated by other means, the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded, or a particular injustic[e] averted, does not provide a basis for 1291 jurisdiction.  Ibid.  Pp.46. 


(b)Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral order appeal, including postjudgment review.  Appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.  Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review apart from collateral order appeal.  First, a party may ask the district court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory appeal involving a controlling question of law the prompt resolution of which may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.  1292(b).  Second, in extraordinary circumstances where a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.  Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U. S. 367, 380.  Another option is for a party to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that, e.g., direc[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established, prohibi[t] the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or strik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.37(b)(2).  Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punishment.  See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n.11.  These established appellate review mechanisms not only provide assurances to clients and counsel about the security of their confidential communications; they also go a long way toward addressing Mohawks concern that, absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe hardship.  The limited benefits of applying the blunt, categorical instrument of 1291 collateral order appeal to privilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify the likely institutional costs, Digital Equipment, supra, at 883, including unduly delaying the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burdening the courts of appeals, cf. Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209.  Pp.612. 


(c)The admonition that the class of collaterally appealable orders must remain narrow and selective in its membership, Will, supra, at 350, has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, not expansion by court decision, as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable, Swint, supra, at 48.  Any further avenue for immediate appeal of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings should be furnished, if at all, through rulemaking, with the opportunity for full airing it provides.  Pp.1213.
541 F.3d 1048, affirmed.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 08992.Argued November 2, 2009Decided December 8, 2009
Respondent Kindler was convicted of capital murder in Pennsylvania state court, and the jury recommended a death sentence.  Kindler filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but before the trial court could consider the motions or the jurys death recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada.  The state trial court subsequently dismissed Kindlers postverdict motions because of his escape.  Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and held him in jail pending extradition.  But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time remaining at large for more than two years.  He was eventually recaptured and transferred to the United States.  Once back in this country, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the motions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvanias fugitive forfeiture law.  Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  Kindlers claims were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.  Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court if the decision of [the state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729.  The District Court nonetheless granted Kindlers habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kindlers habeas claims.  The Third Circuit affirmed, and the Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.  It argued that the Third Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically inadequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and the Commonwealth sought review of that holding.  The Court granted that petition. 
Held:A state procedural rule is not automatically inadequate under the adequate state ground doctrineand therefore unenforceable on federal habeas reviewbecause the state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory.  The question whether a state procedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law.  Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S. 362, 375.  This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking whether the state rule was firmly established and regularly followed.  Id., at 376.  A discretionary state procedural rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.  A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma for the States:They could preserve flexibility by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments.  Or States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.  If forced to choose, many States would opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.  That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are often desirable.  The federal system, for example, often grants the trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking.  The States have followed suit.  Given the federalism and comity concerns motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context, see Coleman, supra, at 730, this Court should not disregard discretionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal courts.

09-91|"MICHIGAN v. JEREMY FISHER
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of michigan
No. 0991.Decided December 7, 2009
Per Curiam.

Police officers responded to a complaint of a disturbance near Allen Road in Brownstown, Michigan.  Officer Christopher Goolsby later testified that, as he and his partner approached the area, a couple directed them to a residence where a man was going crazy.  Docket No. 276439, 2008 WL 786515, *1 (Mich. App., Mar. 25, 2008) (per curiam) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  Upon their arrival, the officers found a household in considerable chaos: a pickup truck in the driveway with its front smashed, damaged fenceposts along the side of the property, and three broken house windows, the glass still on the ground outside.  The officers also noticed blood on the hood of the pickup and on clothes inside of it, as well as on one of the doors to the house.  (It is disputed whether they noticed this immediately upon reaching the house, but undisputed that they noticed it before the allegedly unconstitutional entry.)  Through a window, the officers could see respondent, Jeremy Fisher, inside the house, screaming and throwing things.  The back door was locked, and a couch had been placed to block the front door.


The officers knocked, but Fisher refused to answer.  They saw that Fisher had a cut on his hand, and they asked him whether he needed medical attention.  Fisher ignored these questions and demanded, with accompanying profanity, that the officers go to get a search warrant.  Officer Goolsby then pushed the front door partway open and ventured into the house.  Through the window of the open door he saw Fisher pointing a long gun at him.  Officer Goolsby withdrew.


Fisher was charged under Michigan law with assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  The trial court concluded that Officer Goolsby violated the Fourth Amendment when he entered Fishers house, and granted Fishers motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a resultthat is, Officer Goolsbys statement that Fisher pointed a rifle at him.  The Michigan Court of Appeals initially remanded for an evidentiary hearing, see Docket No. 256027, 2005 WL 3481454 (Dec. 20, 2005) (per curiam), after which the trial court reinstated its order.  The Court of Appeals then affirmed over a dissent by Judge Talbot.  See 2008 WL 786515, at *2; id., at *2*5.  The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, but, after hearing oral argument, it vacated its prior order and denied leave instead; three justices, however, would have taken the case and reversed on the ground that the Court of Appeals misapplied the Fourth Amendment.  See 483 Mich. 1007, 765 N.W. 2d 19 (2009).  Because the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals is indeed contrary to our Fourth Amendment case law, particularly Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398 (2006), we grant the States petition for certiorari and reverse.


[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment, we have often said, is reasonableness.  Id., at 403. Therefore, although searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable, Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), that presumption can be overcome.  For example, the exigencies of the situation [may] make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable.  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393394 (1978).


Brigham City identified one such exigency: the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.  547 U. S., at 403.  Thus, law enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.  Ibid.  This emergency aid exception does not depend on the officers subjective intent or the seriousness of any crime they are investigating when the emergency arises.  Id., at 404405.  It requires only an objectively reasonable basis for believing, id., at 406, that a person within [the house] is in need of immediate aid, Mincey, supra, at 392.


Brigham City illustrates the application of this standard.  There, police officers responded to a noise complaint in the early hours of the morning.  As they approached the house, they could hear from within an altercation occurring, some kind of fight.  547 U. S., at 406 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Following the tumult to the back of the house whence it came, the officers saw juveniles drinking beer in the backyard and a fight unfolding in the kitchen.  They watched through the window as a juvenile broke free from the adults restraining him and punched another adult in the face, who recoiled to the sink, spitting blood.  Ibid.  Under these circumstances, we found it plainly reasonable for the officers to enter the house and quell the violence, for they had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning.  Ibid.


A straightforward application of the emergency aid exception, as in Brigham City, dictates that the officers entry was reasonable.  Just as in Brigham City, the police officers here were responding to a report of a disturbance.  Just as in Brigham City, when they arrived on the scene they encountered a tumultuous situation in the houseand here they also found signs of a recent injury, perhaps from a car accident, outside.  And just as in Brigham City, the officers could see violent behavior inside.  Although Officer Goolsby and his partner did not see punches thrown, as did the officers in Brigham City, they did see Fisher screaming and throwing things.  It would be objectively reasonable to believe that Fishers projectiles might have a human target (perhaps a spouse or a child), or that Fisher would hurt himself in the course of his rage.  In short, we find it as plain here as we did in Brigham City that the officers entry was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.


The Michigan Court of Appeals, however, thought the situation did not rise to a level of emergency justifying the warrantless intrusion into a residence.  2008 WL 786515, at *2.  Although the Court of Appeals conceded that there was evidence an injured person was on the premises, it found it significant that the mere drops of blood did not signal a likely serious, life-threatening injury.  Ibid.  The court added that the cut Officer Goolsby observed on Fishers hand likely explained the trail of blood and that Fisher was very much on his feet and apparently able to see to his own needs.  Ibid.


Even a casual review of Brigham City reveals the flaw in this reasoning.  Officers do not need ironclad proof of a likely serious, life-threatening injury to invoke the emergency aid exception.  The only injury police could confirm in Brigham City was the bloody lip they saw the juvenile inflict upon the adult.  Fisher argues that the officers here could not have been motivated by a perceived need to provide medical assistance, since they never summoned emergency medical personnel.  This would have no bearing, of course, upon their need to assure that Fisher was not endangering someone else in the house.  Moreover, even if the failure to summon medical personnel conclusively established that Goolsby did not subjectively believe, when he entered the house, that Fisher or someone else was seriously injured (which is doubtful), the test, as we have said, is not what Goolsby believed, but whether there was an objectively reasonable basis for believing that medical assistance was needed, or persons were in danger, Brigham City, supra, at 406; Mincey, supra, at 392.


It was error for the Michigan Court of Appeals to replace that objective inquiry into appearances with its hindsight determination that there was in fact no emergency.  It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or the demands of public safety to require officers to walk away from a situation like the one they encountered here.  Only when an apparent threat has become an actual harm can officers rule out innocuous explanations for ominous circumstances.  But [t]he role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties.  Brigham City, supra, at 406.  It sufficed to invoke the emergency aid exception that it was reasonable to believe that Fisher had hurt himself (albeit nonfatally) and needed treatment that in his rage he was unable to provide, or that Fisher was about to hurt, or had already hurt, someone else.  The Michigan Court of Appeals required more than what the Fourth Amendment demands.
***
The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
We have taken the facts from the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals.  Except where indicated, the parties do not dispute the facts.

08-10537|"GEORGE PORTER, Jr. v. BILL McCOLLUM,
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 0810537.Decided November 30, 2009
Per Curiam.

Petitioner George Porter is a veteran who was both wounded and decorated for his active participation in two major engagements during the Korean War; his combat service unfortunately left him a traumatized, changed man.  His commanding officers moving description of those two battles was only a fraction of the mitigating evidence that his counsel failed to discover or present during the penalty phase of his trial in 1988.


In this federal postconviction proceeding, the District Court held that Porters lawyers failure to adduce that evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and granted his application for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, on the ground that the Florida Supreme Courts determination that Porter was not prejudiced by any deficient performance by his counsel was a reasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).  Like the District Court, we are persuaded that it was objectively unreasonable to conclude there was no reasonable probability the sentence would have been different if the sentencing judge and jury had heard the significant mitigation evidence that Porters counsel neither uncovered nor presented.  We therefore grant the petition for certiorari in part and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.[Footnote 1]
I

Porter was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the shooting of his former girlfriend, Evelyn Williams, and her boyfriend Walter Burrows.  He was sentenced to death on the first count but not the second.
In July 1986, as his relationship with Williams was ending, Porter threatened to kill her and then left town.  When he returned to Florida three months later, he attempted to see Williams but her mother told him that Williams did not want to see him.  He drove past Williams house each of the two days prior to the shooting, and the night before the murder he visited Williams, who called the police.  Porter then went to two cocktail lounges and spent the night with a friend, who testified Porter was quite drunk by 11 p.m.  Early the next morning, Porter shot Williams in her house.  Burrows struggled with Porter and forced him outside where Porter shot him.


Porter represented himself, with standby counsel, for most of the pretrial proceedings and during the beginning of his trial.  Near the completion of the States case in chief, Porter pleaded guilty.  He thereafter changed his mind about representing himself, and his standby counsel was appointed as his counsel for the penalty phase.  During the penalty phase, the State attempted to prove four aggravating factors: Porter had been previously convicted of another violent felony (i.e., in Williams case, killing Burrows, and in his case, killing Williams);[Footnote 2] the murder was committed during a burglary; the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner; and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  The defense put on only one witness, Porters ex-wife, and read an excerpt from a deposition.  The sum total of the mitigating evidence was inconsistent testimony about Porters behavior when intoxicated and testimony that Porter had a good relationship with his son.  Although his lawyer told the jury that Porter has other handicaps that werent apparent during the trial and Porter was not mentally healthy, he did not put on any evidence related to Porters mental health.  3 Tr. 477478 (Jan. 22, 1988).


The jury recommended the death sentence for both murders.  The trial court found that the State had proved all four aggravating circumstances for the murder of Williams but that only the first two were established with respect to Burrows murder.  The trial court found no mitigating circumstances and imposed a death sentence for Williams murder only.  On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the sentence over the dissent of two justices, but struck the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor.  Porter v. State, 564 So.2d 1060 (1990) (per curiam).  The court found the State had not carried its burden on that factor because the record is consistent with the hypothesis that Porters was a crime of passion, not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and extraordinarily painful.  Id., at 1063 (emphasis deleted).  The two dissenting justices would have reversed the penalty because the evidence of drunkenness, combined with evidence of Porters emotionally charged, desperate, frustrated desire to meet with his former lover, is sufficient to render the death penalty disproportional punishment in this instance.  Id., at 10651066 (Barkett, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).


In 1995, Porter filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court, claiming his penalty-phase counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence.  The court conducted a 2-day evidentiary hearing, during which Porter presented extensive mitigating evidence, all of which was apparently unknown to his penalty-phase counsel.  Unlike the evidence presented during Porters penalty hearing, which left the jury knowing hardly anything about him other than the facts of his crimes, the new evidence described his abusive childhood, his heroic military service and the trauma he suffered because of it, his long-term substance abuse, and his impaired mental health and mental capacity.


The depositions of his brother and sister described the abuse Porter suffered as a child.  Porter routinely witnessed his father beat his mother, one time so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child.  Porters father was violent every weekend, and by his siblings account, Porter was his fathers favorite target, particularly when Porter tried to protect his mother.  On one occasion, Porters father shot at him for coming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead.  According to his brother, Porter attended classes for slow learners and left school when he was 12 or 13.


To escape his horrible family life, Porter enlisted in the Army at age 17 and fought in the Korean War.  His company commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Pratt, testified at Porters postconviction hearing.  Porter was with the 2d Division, which had advanced above the 38th parallel to Kunu-ri when it was attacked by Chinese forces.  Porter suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during the advance but was with the unit for the battle at Kunu-ri.  While the Eighth Army was withdrawing, the 2d Division was ordered to hold off the Chinese advance, enabling the bulk of the Eighth Army to live to fight another day.  As Colonel Pratt described it, the unit went into position there in bitter cold night, terribly worn out, terribly weary, almost like zombies because we had been in constantfor five days we had been in constant contact with the enemy fighting our way to the rear, little or no sleep, little or no food, literally as I say zombies.  1 Tr. 138 (Jan. 4, 1996).  The next morning, the unit engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand fight with the Chinese and later that day received permission to withdraw, making Porters regiment the last unit of the Eighth Army to withdraw.  Id., at 139140.

Less than three months later, Porter fought in a second battle, at Chipyong-ni.  His regiment was cut off from the rest of the Eighth Army and defended itself for two days and two nights under constant fire.  After the enemy broke through the perimeter and overtook defensive positions on high ground, Porters company was charged with retaking those positions.  In the charge up the hill, the soldiers were under direct open fire of the enemy forces on top of the hill.  They immediately came under mortar, artillery, machine gun, and every other kind of fire you can imagine and they were just dropping like flies as they went along.  Id., at 150.  Porters company lost all three of its platoon sergeants, and almost all of the officers were wounded.  Porter was again wounded and his company sustained the heaviest losses of any troops in the battle, with more than 50% casualties.  Colonel Pratt testified that these battles were very trying, horrifying experiences, particularly for Porters company at Chipyong-ni.  Id., at 152.  Porters unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for the engagement at Chipyong-ni, and Porter individually received two Purple Hearts and the Combat Infantryman Badge, along with other decorations.


Colonel Pratt testified that Porter went absent without leave (AWOL) for two periods while in Korea.  He explained that this was not uncommon, as soldiers sometimes became disoriented and separated from the unit, and that the commander had decided not to impose any punishment for the absences.  In Colonel Pratts experience, an awful lot of [veterans] come back nervous wrecks.  Our [veterans] hospitals today are filled with people mentally trying to survive the perils and hardships [of]  the Korean War, particularly those who fought in the battles he described.  Id., at 153.


When Porter returned to the United States, he went AWOL for an extended period of time.[Footnote 3]  He was sentenced to six months imprisonment for that infraction, but he received an honorable discharge.  After his discharge, he suffered dreadful nightmares and would attempt to climb his bedroom walls with knives at night.[Footnote 4]  Porters family eventually removed all of the knives from the house.  According to Porters brother, Porter developed a serious drinking problem and began drinking so heavily that he would get into fights and not remember them at all.


In addition to this testimony regarding his life history, Porter presented an expert in neuropsychology, Dr. Dee, who had examined Porter and administered a number of psychological assessments.  Dr. Dee concluded that Porter suffered from brain damage that could manifest in impulsive, violent behavior.  At the time of the crime, Dr. Dee testified, Porter was substantially impaired in his ability to conform his conduct to the law and suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, two statutory mitigating circumstances, Fla. Stat. 921.141(6).  Dr. Dee also testified that Porter had substantial difficulties with reading, writing, and memory, and that these cognitive defects were present when he was evaluated for competency to stand trial.  2 Tr. 227228 (Jan. 5, 1996); see also Record 904906.  Although the States experts reached different conclusions regarding the statutory mitigators,[Footnote 5] each expert testified that he could not diagnose Porter or rule out a brain abnormality.  2 Tr. 345, 382 (Jan. 5, 1996); 3 id., at 405.


The trial judge who conducted the state postconviction hearing, without determining counsels deficiency, held that Porter had not been prejudiced by the failure to introduce any of that evidence.  Record 1203, 1206.  He found that Porter had failed to establish any statutory mitigating circumstances, id., at 1207, and that the nonstatutory mitigating evidence would not have made a difference in the outcome of the case, id., at 1210.  He discounted the evidence of Porters alcohol abuse because it was inconsistent and discounted the evidence of Porters abusive childhood because he was 54 years old at the time of the trial.  He also concluded that Porters periods of being AWOL would have reduced the impact of Porters military service to inconsequential proportions.  Id., at 1212.  Finally, he held that even considering all three categories of evidence together, the trial judge and jury still would have imposed death.  Id., at 1214.


The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  It first accepted the trial courts finding that Porter could not have established any statutory mitigating circumstances, based on the trial courts acceptance of the States experts conclusions in that regard.  Porter v. State, 788 So.2d 917, 923 (2001) (per curiam).  It then held the trial court was correct to find the additional nonstatutory mitigation to be lacking in weight because of the specific facts presented.  Id., at 925.  Like the postconviction court, the Florida Supreme Court reserved judgment regarding counsels deficiency.  Ibid.[Footnote 6]  Two justices dissented, reasoning that counsels failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence was especially harmful because of the divided vote affirming the sentence on direct appealeven without the substantial mitigation that we now know existedand because of the reversal of the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor.  Id., at 937 (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).


Porter thereafter filed his federal habeas petition.  The District Court held Porters penalty-phase counsel had been ineffective.  It first determined that counsels performance had been deficient because penalty-phase counsel did little, if any investigation  and failed to effectively advocate on behalf of his client before the jury.  Porter v. Crosby, No. 6:03cv1465Orl31KRS, 2007 WL 1747316, *23 (MD Fla., June 18, 2007).  It then determined that counsels deficient performance was prejudicial, finding that the state courts decision was contrary to clearly established law in part because the state court failed to consider the entirety of the evidence when reweighing the evidence in mitigation, including the trial evidence suggesting that this was a crime of passion, that [Porter] was drinking heavily just hours before the murders, or that [Porter] had a good relationship with his son.  Id., at *30.


The Eleventh Circuit reversed.  It held the District Court had failed to appropriately defer to the state courts factual findings with respect to Porters alcohol abuse and his mental health.  552 F.3d 1260, 1274, 1275 (2008) (per curiam).  The Court of Appeals then separately considered each category of mitigating evidence and held it was not unreasonable for the state court to discount each category as it did.  Id., at 1274.  Porter petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse with respect to the Court of Appeals disposition of Porters ineffective- assistance claim.
II

To prevail under Strickland, Porter must show that his counsels deficient performance prejudiced him.  To establish deficiency, Porter must show his counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  466 U. S., at 688.  To establish prejudice, he must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Id., at 694.  Finally, Porter is entitled to relief only if the state courts rejection of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of Strickland, or it rested on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d).
Because the state court did not decide whether Porters counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porters Strickland claim de novo.  Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 390 (2005).  It is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time of Porters trial, counsel had an obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendants background.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000).  The investigation conducted by Porters counsel clearly did not satisfy those norms.


Although Porter had initially elected to represent himself, his standby counsel became his counsel for the penalty phase a little over a month prior to the sentencing proceeding before the jury.  It was the first time this lawyer had represented a defendant during a penalty-phase proceeding.  At the postconviction hearing, he testified that he had only one short meeting with Porter regarding the penalty phase.  He did not obtain any of Porters school, medical, or military service records or interview any members of Porters family.  In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524, 525 (2003), we held counsel fell short of  professional standards for not expanding their investigation beyond the presentence investigation report and one set of records they obtained, particularly in light of what counsel actually discovered in the records.  Here, counsel did not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses or requesting records.  Cf. Bobby v. Van Hook, ante, at 68 (holding performance not deficient when counsel gathered a substantial amount  of information and then made a reasonable decision not to pursue additional sources); Strickland, 466 U. S., at 699 ([Counsels] decision not to seek more character or psychological evidence than was already in hand was  reasonable).  Beyond that, like the counsel in Wiggins, he ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware.  The court-ordered competency evaluations, for example, collectively reported Porters very few years of regular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his fathers over-disciplin[e].  Record 902906.  As an explanation, counsel described Porter as fatalistic and uncooperative.  But he acknowledged that although Porter instructed him not to speak with Porters ex-wife or son, Porter did not give him any other instructions limiting the witnesses he could interview.


Counsel thus failed to uncover and present any evidence of Porters mental health or mental impairment, his family background, or his military service.  The decision not to investigate did not reflect reasonable professional judgment.  Wiggins, supra, at 534.  Porter may have been fatalistic or uncooperative, but that does not obviate the need for defense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.  See Rompilla, supra, at 381382.
III

Because we find Porters counsel deficient, we must determine whether the Florida Supreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland in holding Porter was not prejudiced by that deficiency.  Under Strickland, a defendant is prejudiced by his counsels deficient performance if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  466 U. S., at 694.  In Florida, the sentencing judge makes the determination as to the existence and weight of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the punishment, Fla. Stat. 921.141(3), but he must give the jury verdict of life or death great weight, Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (per curiam).  Porter must show that but for his counsels deficiency, there is a reasonable probability he would have received a different sentence.  To assess that probability, we consider the totality of the available mitigation evidenceboth that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceedingand reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.  Williams, supra, at 397398.
This is not a case in which the new evidence would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the sentencing judge.  Strickland, supra, at 700.  The judge and jury at Porters original sentencing heard almost nothing that would humanize Porter or allow them to accurately gauge his moral culpability.  They learned about Porters turbulent relationship with Williams, his crimes, and almost nothing else.  Had Porters counsel been effective, the judge and jury would have learned of the kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendants moral culpability.  Wiggins, supra, at 535.  They would have heard about (1) Porters heroic military service in two of the most criticaland horrificbattles of the Korean War, (2) his struggles to regain normality upon his return from war, (3) his childhood history of physical abuse, and (4) his brain abnormality, difficulty reading and writing, and limited schooling.  See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 219 (1989) ([E]vidence about the defendants background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background  may be less culpable).  Instead, they heard absolutely none of that evidence, evidence which might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of [Porters] moral culpability.  Williams, 529 U. S., at 398.


On the other side of the ledger, the weight of evidence in aggravation is not as substantial as the sentencing judge thought.  As noted, the sentencing judge accepted the jurys recommendation of a death sentence for the murder of Williams but rejected the jurys death-sentence recommendation for the murder of Burrows.  The sentencing judge believed that there were four aggravating circumstances related to the Williams murder but only two for the Burrows murder.  Accordingly, the judge must have reasoned that the two aggravating circumstances that were present in both cases were insufficient to warrant a death sentence but that the two additional aggravating circumstances present with respect to the Williams murder were sufficient to tip the balance in favor of a death sentence.  But the Florida Supreme Court rejected one of these additional aggravating circumstances, i.e., that Williams murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, finding the murder consistent with  a crime of passion even though premeditated to a heightened degree.  564 So.2d, at 10631064.  Had the judge and jury been able to place Porters life history on the mitigating side of the scale, and appropriately reduced the ballast on the aggravating side of the scale, there is clearly a reasonable probability that the advisory juryand the sentencing judgewould have struck a different balance, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 537, and it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise.


The Florida Supreme Courts decision that Porter was not prejudiced by his counsels failure to conduct a thoroughor even cursoryinvestigation is unreasonable.  The Florida Supreme Court either did not consider or unreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence adduced in the postconviction hearing.  Under Florida law, mental health evidence that does not rise to the level of establishing a statutory mitigating circumstance may nonetheless be considered by the sentencing judge and jury as mitigating.  See, e.g., Hoskins v. State, 965 So.2d 1, 1718 (Fla. 2007) (per curiam).  Indeed, the Constitution requires that the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating factor.  Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112 (1982).  Yet neither the postconviction trial court nor the Florida Supreme Court gave any consideration for the purpose of nonstatutory mitigation to Dr. Dees testimony regarding the existence of a brain abnormality and cognitive defects.[Footnote 7]  While the States experts identified perceived problems with the tests that Dr. Dee used and the conclusions that he drew from them, it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that his testimony might have had on the jury or the sentencing judge.


Furthermore, the Florida Supreme Court, following the state postconviction court, unreasonably discounted the evidence of Porters childhood abuse and military service.  It is unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence of Porters abusive childhood, especially when that kind of history may have particular salience for a jury evaluating Porters behavior in his relationship with Williams.  It is also unreasonable to conclude that Porters military service would be reduced to inconsequential proportions, 788 So.2d, at 925, simply because the jury would also have learned that Porter went AWOL on more than one occasion.  Our Nation has a long tradition of according leniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially for those who fought on the front lines as Porter did.[Footnote 8]  Moreover, the relevance of Porters extensive combat experience is not only that he served honorably under extreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that the jury might find mitigating the intense stress and mental and emotional toll that combat took on Porter.[Footnote 9]  The evidence that he was AWOL is consistent with this theory of mitigation and does not impeach or diminish the evidence of his service.  To conclude otherwise reflects a failure to engage with what Porter actually went through in Korea.


As the two dissenting justices in the Florida Supreme Court reasoned, there exists too much mitigating evidence that was not presented to now be ignored.  Id., at 937 (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Although the burden is on petitioner to show he was prejudiced by his counsels deficiency, the Florida Supreme Courts conclusion that Porter failed to meet this burden was an unreasonable application of our clearly established law.  We do not require a defendant to show that counsels deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome of his penalty proceeding, but rather that he establish a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in [that] outcome.  Strickland, 466 U. S., at 693694.  This Porter has done.


The petition for certiorari is granted in part, and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
We deny the petition insofar as it challenges his conviction. 
It is an aggravating factor under Florida law that [t]he defendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.  Fla. Stat. 921.141(5)(b) (1987).  In Porters case, the State established that factor by reference to Porters contemporaneous convictions stemming from the same episode: two counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.  Tr. 5 (Mar. 4, 1988).
Porter explained to one of the doctors who examined him for competency to stand trial that he went AWOL in order to spend time with his son.  Record 904.
Porters expert testified that these symptoms would easily warrant a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  2 Tr. 233 (Jan. 5, 1996).  PTSD is not uncommon among veterans returning from combat.  See Hearing on Fiscal Year 2010 Budget for Veterans Programs before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., 63 (2009) (uncorrected copy) (testimony of Eric K. Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), reporting that approximately 23 percent of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans seeking treatment at a VA medical facility had been preliminarily diagnosed with PTSD).
The State presented two experts, Dr. Riebsame and Dr. Kirkland.  Neither of the States experts had examined Porter, but each testified that based upon their review of the record, Porter met neither statutory mitigating circumstance.
The postconviction court stated defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue mental health evaluations and  [Porter] has thus failed to show sufficient evidence that any statutory mitigators could have been presented.  Record 1210.  It is not at all clear whether this stray comment addressed counsels deficiency.  If it did, then it was at most dicta, because the court expressly decline[d] to make a determination regarding whether or not Defense Counsel was in fact deficient here.  Id., at 1206.  The Florida Supreme Court simply paraphrased the postconviction court when it stated trial counsels decision not to pursue mental evaluations did not exceed the bounds for competent counsel.  Porter v. State, 788 So.2d 917, 923924 (2001) (per curiam).  But that court also expressly declined to answer the question of deficiency.  Id., at 925.
The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged that Porter had presented evidence of statutory and nonstatutory mental mitigation, 788 So.2d, at 921, but it did not consider Porters mental health evidence in its discussion of nonstatutory mitigating evidence, id., at 924.
See Abbott, The Civil War and the Crime Wave of 186570, 1 Soc. Serv. Rev. 212, 232234 (1927) (discussing the movement to pardon or parole prisoners who were veterans of the Civil War); Rosenbaum, The Relationship Between War and Crime in the United States, 30 J. Crim. L. & C. 722, 733734 (1940) (describing a 1922 study by the Wisconsin Board of Control that discussed the number of veterans imprisoned in the State and considered the greater leniency that may be shown to ex-service men in court). 
Cf. Cal. Penal Code Ann. 1170.9(a) (West Supp. 2009) (providing a special hearing for a person convicted of a crime who alleges that he or she committed the offense as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems stemming from service in a combat theater in the United States military); Minn. Stat. 609.115, Subd. 10 (2008) (providing for a special process at sentencing if the defendant is a veteran and has been diagnosed as having a mental illness by a qualified psychiatrist).

08-1263|"ROBERT WONG, WARDEN v. FERNANDO
BELMONTES, Jr.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081263.Decided November 16, 2009
Per Curiam.

In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmontes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in the head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See People v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759761, 755 P. 2d 310, 315316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his accomplices stole McConnells stereo, sold it for $100, and used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night.  Id., at 764765, 755 P.2d, at 318319.


Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas relief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we overturned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7 (2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).  On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Belmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. The District Court had previously denied relief on that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had performed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but that Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).  Belmontes v. Calderon, Civ. S890736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a.  The Court of Appeals agreed that counsels performance was deficient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to prejudice, determining that counsels errors undermined confidence in the penalty phase verdict.  Belmontes v. Ayers, 529 F.3d 834, 859863, 874 (CA9 2008).  We disagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the States petition for certiorari, and reverse. 
I

Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.  To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687.  To show deficient performance, Belmontes must establish that counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Id., at 688.  In light of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant, the performance inquiry necessarily turns on whether counsels assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.  Id., at 688689.  At all points, [j]udicial scrutiny of counsels performance must be highly deferential.  Id., at 689.
The challenge confronting Belmontes lawyer, John Schick, was very specific.  Substantial evidence indicated that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during the penalty phase of the McConnell trial.  The evidence of the prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness testimony, Belmontes own admissions, and Belmontes possession of the murder weapon and the same type of ammunition used to kill the victim.  Record 22392250, 2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept. 26, 1995).


The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.  It would have shown that two years before Steacy McConnells death, police found Jerry Howards body in a secluded area.  Howard had been killed execution style, with a bullet to the back of the head.  The authorities suspected Belmontes, but on the eve of trial the States witnesses refused to cooperate (Belmontes mother had begged one not to testify).  The prosecution therefore believed it could not prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.  What the prosecution could prove, even without the recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed the gun used to murder Howard.  So the State offered, and Belmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter.  Record 22392243; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.

But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the murder, boasting to several people that he had killed Howard.  Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney that Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police informant told detectives that Belmontes bragged about the murder, stating that he was mad at Howard because the night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldnt share it with him.  After double jeopardy protection set in and he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted his responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the California Youth Authority, Charles Sapien.  During his time in confinement, Belmontes had always denied that he was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.  But because Sapien had been square with [Belmontes], Belmontes decided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling Sapien that he had wasted that guy. Record 2240; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.


Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evidence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude it.  California evidentiary rules, Schick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the evidence, but those same rules made clear that the evidence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.  Record 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, 42 Cal. 3d 730, 791792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v. Harris, 28 Cal. 3d 935, 960962, 623 P.2d 240, 254 (1981).  Schick thus had grave concerns that, even if he succeeded initially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.  Accordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, structuring his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit that possibility.  Deposition of John Schick 301, 309310; see Strickland, supra, at 699 (Restricting testimony on respondents character to what had come in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and respondents criminal history, which counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come in).


As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit this evidence during the sentencing phase.  Schick moved to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughternothing more.  Record 22402254.  Schick succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his client remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evidence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick opened the door.  Id., at 2256.


This was not an empty threat.  In one instance, Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent person.  The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury, argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with the Howard murder evidence.  Id., at 23322334.  The Court warned Schick that it was going to have to allow [the prosecution] to go into the whole background if Schick continued his line of questioning.  Id., at 2334.  Schick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.  Ibid.


The Courts warning reinforced Schicks understanding that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully to preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder evidence.  With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for mitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder evidence.  See id., at 23122417.


The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these efforts, Schicks performance was constitutionally deficient under Circuit precedent.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 862863.  The State challenges that conclusion, but we need not resolve the point, because we agree with the District Court that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.
II

To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694.  That showing requires Belmontes to establish a reasonable probability that a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigating evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing, and that had the jury been confronted with this  mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it would have returned with a different sentence.  Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).
The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably competent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evidence, on top of what Schick had already presented.  For purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclusion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable probability that a jury presented with this additional mitigation evidence would have returned a different verdict.


In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider all the relevant evidence that the jury would have had before it if Schick had pursued the different pathnot just the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly would have come in with it.  See Strickland, supra, at 695696, 700.  Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes must show a reasonable probability that the jury would have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire body of mitigating evidence (including the additional testimony Schick could have presented) against the entire body of aggravating evidence (including the Howard murder evidence).  Belmontes cannot meet this burden.


We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did present during the sentencing phase.  That evidence was substantial.  The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the same record in Belmontes first habeas appeal agreed, recognizing the substantial nature of the mitigating evidence Schick presented.  Belmontes v. Woodford, 350 F.3d 861, 907 (2003).  It reiterated the point several times.  See id., at 874, 901, 908.


All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a span of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on Belmontes behalf.  A number of those witnesses highlighted Belmontes terrible childhood.  They testified that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.  Belmontes grandfather described the one-bedroom house where Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a chicken coop.  Belmontes did not do well in school; he dropped out in the ninth grade.  His younger sister died when she was only 10 months old.  And his grandmother died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.  See Record 23142319, 23242325, 2344.


Family members also testified that, despite these difficulties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister.  Id., at 23172318, 23252326.  And Belmontes best friend offered the insights of a close friend and confidant.  Id., at 23292332.


Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes religious conversion while in state custody on the accessory charge.  These witnesses told stories about Belmontes efforts advising other inmates in his detention centers religious program, to illustrate that he could live a productive and meaningful life in prison.  They described his success working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his rise from lowest man on the team to second in command.  Belmontes assistant chaplain even said that he would use Belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling program if the jury handed down a life sentence.  Id., at 23792384, 23962398, 24002407.


Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying about his childhood and religious conversion, both at sentencing and during allocution.  Belmontes described his childhood as pretty hard, but took responsibility for his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his background as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now  because of that.  Id., at 2343.


On remand from this Court, the Court of Appealsaddressing Belmontes ineffective assistance claim for the first timechanged its view of this evidence.  Instead of finding Schicks mitigation case substantial, as it previously had, Belmontes, 350 F.3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit this time around labeled it cursory, Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 841, 861, n.14, 866.  Compare also Belmontes, 350 F.3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence Schick presented substantial), with Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence insubstantial).  More evidence, the Court of Appeals now concluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more evidence to humanize Belmontes, as that court put it no fewer than 11 times in its opinion.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n.18, 869, 872, 874.  The Court determined that the failure to put on this evidence prejudiced Belmontes.


There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of the evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing evidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was already there would have made little difference.  Other evidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put into play aspects of Belmontes character that would have triggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in rebuttal.  This evidence would have made a difference, but in the wrong direction for Belmontes.  In either event, Belmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.


First, the cumulative evidence.  In the Court of Appeals view, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing evidence about Belmontes difficult childhood and highlighted his positive attributes.  529 F.3d, at 864.  As for his difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses to testify that when Belmontes was five years old, his 10-month-old sister died of a brain tumor, that he exhibited symptoms of depression after her death, that his grandmother suffered from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction, and that both his immediate and extended family lived in a state of constant strife.  Ibid.  As for his positive attributes, Schick should have produced testimony about Belmontes strong character as a child in the face of adversity.  Ibid.  Schick should have illustrated that Belmontes was kind, responsible, and likeable; that he got along well with his siblings and was respectful towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his mixed racial background; and that he participated in community activities, kept up in school and got along with his teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.  Ibid.


But as recounted above and recognized by the state courts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on substantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the same humanizing theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.  Compare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month-old sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at 23142315 (family members addictions); id., at 23142315, 23242325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317, 2319, 23472348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at 23262327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 23172319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 23482351 (participation in community religious events); see also, e.g., Belmontes Traverse to Respondents Return to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5890736EJGJFM (ED Cal.), p.64 ([C]ounsels presentation was arguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of humanizing petitioner).  The sentencing jury was thus well acquainted with Belmontes background and potential humanizing features.  Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 481 (2007).  Additional evidence on these points would have offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.


The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evidence Schick presented and the additional evidence it proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had submitted expert testimony.  Such testimony could make connections between the various themes in the mitigation case and explain to the jury how they could have contributed to Belmontess involvement in criminal activity.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 853.  See also ibid. (discussing experts federal habeas testimony on importance of expert testimony).  But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth Circuit would have required Schick to present was neither complex nor technical.  It required only that the jury make logical connections of the kind a layperson is well equipped to make.  The jury simply did not need expert testimony to understand the humanizing evidence; it could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.


What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes mental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it in some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes to the Howard evidence.  See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168, 186 (1986) (Any attempt to portray petitioner as a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the State to rebut with evidence of petitioners prior convictions. Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to put on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they would have been faced with his admission at trial that, although still married, he was spending the weekend furlough with a girlfriend).


If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes had a high likelihood of a  nonviolent adjustment to a prison setting, as Belmontes suggested an expert might, see Brief for Appellant in No. 0199018 (CA9), p.34, the question would have immediately arisen: What was his propensity toward violence to begin with?  Does evidence of another murder alter your view?  Expert testimony explaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed simply to facts that might elicit that response, would have led to a similar rejoinder: Is such sympathy equally appropriate for someone who committed a second murder?  Any of this testimony from an experts perspective would have made the Howard evidence fair game.


Many of Belmontes other arguments fail for the same reason.  He argues that the jury should have been told that he suffered an extended bout with rheumatic fever, which led to emotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning.  Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 120.  But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard murder and Belmontes subsequent bragging about it would have served as a powerful counterpoint.


The type of more-evidence-is-better approach advocated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem appealingafter all, what is there to lose?  But here there was a lot to lose.  A heavyhanded case to portray Belmontes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have invited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttalthe evidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but two murders.


Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigating evidence might not have opened the door to the prior murder evidence.  The Court of Appeals went so far as to state, without citation, that [t]here would be no basis for suggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different if the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two murders rather than one.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 869, n.20.  But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testimony explain[ing]  involvement in criminal activity, id., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.  And even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as the Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders were so different in character made each of them highly pertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envisioned by the Court of Appeals.


The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick opened the door.  Id., at 869870, n.20.  If Schick had doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have secured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.  Ibid.  The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he stood.  While ruling that the prosecution could not present the evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge made clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal purposes, id., at 2256, 23322334.  When Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example, the judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he would admit the Howard murder evidenceto let the prosecution go into the whole backgroundif Schick pressed forward.  Id., at 2334.


In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggravators, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the aggravating evidence the State presented as scant.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878.  That characterization misses Stricklands point that the reviewing court must consider all the evidencethe good and the badwhen evaluating prejudice.  See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 695696, 700.  Here, the worst kind of bad evidence would have come in with the good.  The only reason it did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation case.  The States aggravation evidence could only be characterized as scant if one ignores the elephant in the courtroomBelmontes role in the Howard murderthat would have been presented had Schick submitted the additional mitigation evidence.  Belmontes v. Ayers, 551 F.3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).


Even on the record before itwhich did not include the Howard murderthe state court determined that Belmontes was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutality.  Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.  That court also noted that [t]he properly admitted aggravating evidence in this casein particular, the circumstances of the crimewas simply overwhelming.  Id., at 809, 755 P.2d, at 348 (citation omitted).  The Ninth Circuit saw the murder differently.  It viewed the circumstances of the crime as only conceivably significant as an aggravating factor.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 871.  In particular, the Court of Appeals concluded that [t]he crime here did not involve  needless suffering on the part of the victim.  Ibid.


We agree with the state courts characterization of the murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve needless suffering.  The jury saw autopsy photographs showing Steacy McConnells mangled head, her skull crushed by 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found to have been wielded by Belmontes.  McConnells corpse showed numerous defensive bruises and contusions on [her] hands, arms, and feet, id., at 839, which plainly evidenced a desperate struggle for life at [Belmontes] hands, Belmontes, 755 P. 2d, at 354.  Belmontes left McConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for her life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries caused by the blows from Belmontes.  Record 3.  The jury also heard that this savage murder was committed solely to prevent interference with a burglary that netted Belmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.  McConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.


Some of the error below may be traced to confusion about the appropriate standard and burden of proof.  While the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language from Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might have applied something different.  In explaining its prejudice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that [t]he aggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence that Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough, in light of the mitigating evidence that could have been adduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.  Belmontes, 529 F.3d, at 875.  But Strickland does not require the State to rule out a sentence of life in prison to prevail.  Rather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant, not the State, to show a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.  466 U. S., at 694.  Under a proper application of the Strickland standard, Belmontes cannot carry this burden.


It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional facts about Belmontes difficult childhood outweighing the facts of McConnells murder.  It becomes even harder to envision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes had committed another murderthe most powerful imaginable aggravating evidence, as Judge Levi put it, Belmontes, S-890736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183ais added to the mix.  Schicks mitigation strategy failed, but the notion that the result could have been different if only Schick had put on more than the nine witnesses he did, or called expert witnesses to bolster his case, is fanciful.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

09-144|"DAVID BOBBY, WARDEN v. ROBERT J. VAN HOOK
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 09144.Decided November 9, 2009
Per Curiam.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted habeas relief to Robert Van Hook on the ground that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his capital trial.  Because we think it clear that Van Hooks attorneys met the constitutional minimum of competence under the correct standard, we grant the petition and reverse.
I

On February 18, 1985, Van Hook went to a Cincinnati bar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find someone to rob.  He approached David Self, and after the two spent several hours drinking together they left for Selfs apartment.  There Van Hook lured Self into a vulnerable position and attacked him, first strangling him until he was unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife and mutilating his body.  State v. Van Hook, 39 Ohio St. 3d 256, 256257, 530 N.E. 2d 883, 884 (1988).  Before fleeing with Selfs valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover his tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body and smearing fingerprints he had left behind.  Six weeks later, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.
Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder, with one capital specification, and aggravated robbery.  He waived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel found him guilty of both charges and the capital specification.  At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight mitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an unsworn statement.  After weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the death penalty.  The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal, id., at 265, 530 N.E. 2d, at 892; State v. Van Hook, No.
C850565, 1987 WL 11202 (Ohio App., May 13, 1987) (per curiam), and we denied certiorari, Van Hook v. Ohio, 489 U. S. 1100 (1989).  Van Hook also sought state postconviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied.  State v. Van Hook, No. C910505, 1992 WL 308350 (Ohio App., Oct. 21, 1992) (per curiam), appeal denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d 1440, 608 N.E. 2d 1085, rehearing denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d 1470, 611 N.E. 2d 328 (1993); State v. Van Hook, 70 Ohio St. 3d 1216, 639 N.E. 2d 1199 (1994).


Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995.  The District Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims.  Van Hook v. Anderson, No. C194269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a.  A panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hooks confession was unconstitutionally obtained under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981).  See Van Hook v. Anderson, 444 F.3d 830, 832 (2006).  The en banc Sixth Circuit vacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper, and it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van Hooks other claims.  See Van Hook v. Anderson, 488 F.3d 411, 428 (2007).  Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we denied.  Van Hook v. Hudson, 552 U. S. 1023 (2007).


On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief again, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys were ineffective during the penalty phase because they did not adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health expert, and requested and relied on a presentence investigation report without objecting to damaging evidence it contained.  See Van Hook v. Anderson, 535 F.3d 458, 461 (2008).  The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the panels opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second time it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion.  See Van Hook v. Anderson, 560 F.3d 523, 524 (2009).  In its third opinion, the panelrelying on guidelines published by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003granted relief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers performed deficiently in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence.  See id., at 525.  The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse.
II

Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition before April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply.  See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 327 (1997).  Even without the Acts added layer of deference to state-court judgments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Van Hook is entitled to relief.
A
The Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to the effective assistance of counselthat is, representation that does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n.14 (1970)).  That standard is necessarily a general one.  No particular set of detailed rules for counsels conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.  466 U. S., at 688689.  Restatements of professional standards, we have recognized, can be useful as guides to what reasonableness entails, but only to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place.  Id., at 688.


The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying on ABA guidelines announced 18 years after Van Hook went to trial.  See 560 F.3d, at 526528 (quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment., pp. 8183 (rev. ed. 2003)).  The ABA standards in effect in 1985 described defense counsels duty to investigate both the merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms:  It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.  1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 44.1, p. 453 (2d ed. 1980).  The accompanying two-page commentary noted that defense counsel have a substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors, and that [i]nformation concerning the defendants background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the like, will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense itself.  Id., at  455.


Quite different are the ABAs 131-page Guidelines for capital defense counsel, published in 2003, on which the Sixth Circuit relied.  Those directives expanded what had been (in the 1980 Standards) a broad outline of defense counsels duties in all criminal cases into detailed prescriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.  They discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence in exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look for, where to look, and when to begin.  See ABA Guidelines 10.7, comment., at 8085.  They include, for example, the requirement that counsels investigation cover every period of the defendants life from the moment of conception, id., at 81, and that counsel contact virtually everyonewho knew [the defendant] and his family and obtain records concerning not only the client, but also his parents, grandparents, siblings, and children, id., at 83.  Judging counsels conduct in the 1980s on the basis of these 2003 Guidelineswithout even pausing to consider whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice at the time of the trialwas error.


To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following Circuit precedent) treated the ABAs 2003 Guidelines not merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys would do, but as inexorable commands with which all capital defense counsel must fully comply. 560 F.3d, at 526 (quoting Dickerson v. Bagley, 453 F.3d 690, 693 (CA6 2006)).  Strickland stressed, however, that American Bar Association standards and the like are only guides to what reasonableness means, not its definition.  466 U. S., at 688.  We have since regarded them as such.[Footnote 1]  See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003).  What we have said of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards set by private organizations: [W]hile States are free to impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that criminal defendants are well represented, we have held that the Federal Constitution imposes one general requirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.  Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479 (2000).
B

Van Hook insists that the Sixth Circuits missteps made no difference because his counsel were ineffective even under professional standards prevailing at the time.  He is wrong.
Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that his attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late, waiting until he was found guiltyonly days before the sentencing hearingto dig into his background.  See 560 F.3d, at 528.  But the record shows they started much sooner.  Between Van Hooks indictment and his trial less than three months later, they contacted their lay witnesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his mother (beginning within a week after the indictment), once with both parents together, twice with an aunt who lived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a child, and three times with a family friend whom Van Hook visited immediately after the crime.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a383a, 384a387a.  As for their expert witnesses, they were in touch with one more than a month before trial, and they met with the other for two hours a week before the trial court reached its verdict.  Id., at 382a, 386a.  Moreover, after reviewing his military history, they met with a representative of the Veterans Administration seven weeks before trial and attempted to obtain his medical records.  Id., at 381a, 386a.  And they looked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial was still five weeks away.  Id., at 386a.  The Sixth Circuit, in short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hooks lawyers waited until the last minute.  560 F.3d, at 528.  Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 395 (2000) (counsel waited until a week before the trial to prepare for the sentencing phase).


Nor was the scope of counsels investigation unreasonable.[Footnote 2]  The Sixth Circuit said Van Hooks attorneys found only a little information about his traumatic childhood experience, 560 F.3d, at 528, but that is a gross distortion.  The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook (whose parents were both heavy drinkers) started drinking as a toddler, began barhopping with his father at age 9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from age 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol into adulthood.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a312a, 323a326a, 328a330a, 373a.  The court also heard that Van Hook grew up in a combat zone:  He watched his father beat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and knife-point, observed episodes of sexual violence while sleeping in his parents bedroom, and was beaten himself at least once.  Id., at 321a, 338a339a, 371a.  It learned that Van Hook, who had fantasies about killing and war from an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and alcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and attempted suicide five times (including a month before the murder), id., at 351a353a, 372a.  And although the experts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a mental disease or defect, the trial court learned that Van Hooks borderline personality disorder and his consumption of drugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired his ability to refrain from the [crime], id., at 303a, and that his explo[sion] of senseless and bizarre brutality may have resulted from what one expert termed a homosexual panic, id., at 376a.


Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did present, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his counsel for failing to find more.  What his counsel did discover, the argument goes, gave them reason to suspect that much worse details existed, and that suspicion should have prompted them to interview other family membershis stepsister, two uncles, and two auntsas well as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of whom could have helped his counsel narrate the true story of Van Hooks childhood experiences.  560 F.3d, at 528.  But there comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties.  The ABA Standards prevailing at the time called for Van Hooks counsel to cover several broad categories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards
44.1, comment., at 455, which they did.  And given all the evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van Hooks upbringing and the experts who reviewed his history, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify and interview every other living family member or every therapist who once treated his parents.  This is not a case in which the defendants attorneys failed to act while potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in the face, cf. Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 525, or would have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained, cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 389393 (2005).  It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in which defense counsels decision not to seek more mitigating evidence from the defendants background than was already in hand fell well within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.  466 U. S., at 699.[Footnote 3]


What is more, even if Van Hooks counsel performed deficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no prejudice as a result.  See id., at 694. As the Ohio court that rejected Van Hooks state habeas petition found, the affidavits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows their testimony would have added nothing of value.  See State v. Van Hook, No. C910505, 1992 WL 308350, *2.  Only two witnesses even arguably would have added new, relevant information: One of Van Hooks uncles noted that Van Hooks mother was temporarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, and Van Hooks stepsister mentioned that his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill Van Hooks mother.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a.  But the trial court had already heardfrom Van Hooks mother herselfthat she had been under psychiatric care more than once.  Id., at 340a.  And it was already aware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked Van Hooks mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least once.  See also id., at 305a (noting that Van Hook suffered from a significant degree of neglect and abuse throughout his chaotic childhood). Neither the Court of Appeals nor Van Hook has shown why the minor additional details the trial court did not hear would have made any difference.


On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evidence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court found: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the course of an aggravated robbery.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2929.04(A)(7) (Lexis 2006).  Van Hooks confession made clear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was the sole perpetrator of the crime and that [h]is intention from beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in their evenings activities.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; see id., at 276a278a, 294a.  Nor did he arrive at that intention on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the same strategyof luring homosexual men into secluded settings to rob themmany times since his teenage years, and he employed it again even after Selfs murder in the weeks before his arrest.  See id., at 279a, 295a, 374a.  Although Van Hook apparently deviated from his original plan once the offense was underwaygoing beyond stealing Selfs goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead bodythat hardly helped his cause.  The Sixth Circuit, which focused on the number of aggravating factors instead of their weight, see 560 F.3d, at 530; cf. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2929.04(B), gave all this evidence short shrift, leading it to overstate further the effect additional mitigating evidence might have had.
***

The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
The narrow grounds for our opinion should not be regarded as accepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to evaluate post-2003 representation.  For that to be proper, the Guidelines must reflect [p]revailing norms of practice, Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688, and standard practice, Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003), and must not be so detailed that they would interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions, Strickland, supra, at 689.  We express no views on whether the 2003 Guidelines meet these criteria.
In his brief in this Court, Van Hook also alludes to his counsels failure to obtain an independent mental-health expert and their reliance on (and failure to object to harmful evidence in) a presentence investigation reportgrounds on which the Sixth Circuit panel previously relied but which it abandoned in its final opinion.  See supra, at 23.  Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a basis for issuing the writ, Brief in Opposition 5; see also id., at 7, and accordingly we do not address them.
In addition to the evidence the Sixth Circuit said his attorneys overlooked, Van Hook alleges that his lawyers failed to provide the expert witnesses with a complete set of relevant records or [his] complete psycho-social history.  Brief in Opposition 4.  But he offers no support for that assertion.  He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or present records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but the record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written expert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would have gleaned from the latter, see id., at 373a377a.

08-10495|"JOSEPH E. CORCORAN v. MARK LEVENHAGEN,
SUPERINTENDENT, INDIANA STATE PRISON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 0810495.Decided October 20, 2009
Per Curiam.

An Indiana jury convicted Joseph Corcoran of four counts of murder.  Corcoran was sentenced to death.  After Corcorans challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts failed, he sought federal habeas relief.  Corcoran argued in his federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court committed various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment; (3) Indianas capital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the prosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5) he should not be executed because he suffers from a mental illness.  See Corcoran v. Buss, 483 F.Supp. 2d 709, 719, 726 (ND Ind. 2007).  The District Court granted habeas relief on Corcorans claim of a Sixth Amendment violation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Corcoran to a penalty other than death.  Id., at 725726.  The District Court did not address Corcorans other arguments relating to his sentence, noting that they were rendered moot by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because of the Sixth Amendment violation.  Id., at 734.


The Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts Sixth Amendment ruling.  Corcoran v. Buss, 551 F.3d 703, 712, 714 (2008).  Then, without mentioning Corcorans other sentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded with instructions to deny the writ, stating that Indiana is at liberty to reinstate the death penalty.  Id., at 714.  Corcoran sought rehearing, arguing that the Court of Appeals should have allowed the District Court to consider his additional attacks on his sentence.  But the Court of Appeals denied rehearing, again without referring to Corcorans undecided claims.


We now grant certiorari and hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in disposing of Corcorans other claims without explanation of any sort.  The Seventh Circuit should have permitted the District Court to consider Corcorans unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why such consideration was unnecessary.


In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Corcorans claims were waived, and that they were in any event frivolous, so that a remand would be wasteful.  Brief in Opposition 910.  Nothing in the Seventh Circuits opinion, however, suggests that this was the basis for that courts order that the writ be denied.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

When the results of such an exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous public debate ensued.  Confronted with arguments both for and against certifying the test resultsand threats of a lawsuit either waythe City threw out the results based on the statistical racial disparity.  Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the Citys refusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials, alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them based on their race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The defendants responded that had they certified the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The Citys action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.  Pp.1634.
(a)Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities, 2000e2(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate impact).  Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disparate impact, the employer may defend by demonstrating that its
policy or practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.  Ibid.  If the employer meets that burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employers legitimate needs.  2000e2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).  Pp.1719. 


(b)Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.  The Courts analysis begins with the premise that the Citys actions would violate Title VIIs disparate-treatment prohibition absent some valid defense.  All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected the test results because the higher scoring candidates were white.  Without some other justification, this express, race-based decisionmaking is prohibited.  The question, therefore, is whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.  The Court has considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context of the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause.  Such cases can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context.  See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 993.  In those cases, the Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial discriminationactions that are themselves based on raceare constitutional only where there is a strong basis in evidence that the remedial actions were necessary.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 500; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277.  In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Wygant plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segregation and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other.  476 U. S., at 277.  It reasoned that [e]videntiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.  Ibid.  The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title VIIs disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions.   Applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.  It also allows the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consistent with other Title VII provisions, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores based on race, see 2000e2(l), and the section that expressly protects bona fide promotional exams, see 2000e2(h).  Thus, the Court adopts the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction in order to resolve any conflict between Title VIIs disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions.  Pp.1926. 


(c)The Citys race-based rejection of the test results cannot satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence standard.  Pp.2634. 


(i)The racial adverse impact in this litigation was significant, and petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability.  The problem for respondents is that such a prima facie caseessentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 446, and nothing moreis far from a strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the test results.  That is because the City could be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally valid, less discriminatory alternative that served the Citys needs but that the City refused to adopt.  2000e2(k)(1)(A), (C).  Based on the record the parties developed through discovery, there is no substantial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.  Pp.2628.  


(ii)The Citys assertions that the exams at issue were not job related and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contradicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to develop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the questions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieutenant positions.  The testimony also shows that complaints that certain examination questions were contradictory or did not specifically apply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that the City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams validity.  Pp.2829. 


(iii)Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an equally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by certifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.  Respondents three arguments to the contrary all fail.  First, respondents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation would have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then-open positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the candidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the different weighting would be an equally valid way to determine whether candidates are qualified for promotions.  Second, respondents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpretation of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less discriminatory results; but respondents approach would have violated Title VIIs prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results, 2000e2(l).  Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assessment center to evaluate candidates behavior in typical job tasks would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for the exams at issue.  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) statements in the record.  Pp.2933.  


(iv)Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the Citys reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions.  Discarding the test results was impermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment claim.  If, after it certifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of todays holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.  Pp.3334.

08-453|"CUOMO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION, L. L. C., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 08453.Argued April 28, 2009Decided June 29, 2009
To determine whether various national banks had violated New Yorks fair-lending laws, the States Attorney General, whose successor in office is the petitioner here, sent them letters in 2005 requesting in lieu of subpoena that they provide certain nonpublic information about their lending practices.  Respondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC) and a banking trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming that the Comptrollers regulation promulgated under the National Bank Act (NBA) prohibits that form of state law enforcement against national banks.  The District Court entered an injunction prohibiting the Attorney General from enforcing state fair-lending laws through demands for records or judicial proceedings.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The Comptrollers regulation purporting to pre-empt state law enforcement is not a reasonable interpretation of the NBA.  Pp. 215. 
(a)Evidence from the time of the NBAs enactment, this Courts cases, and application of normal construction principles make clear that the NBA does not prohibit ordinary enforcement of state law.  Pp.211. 


(i)The NBA provides: No national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts , or  directed by Congress.  12 U. S.C. 484(a).  Among other things, the Comptrollers regulation implementing 484(a) forbids States to exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records, or, as here pertinent, prosecuting enforcement actions except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.  12 CFR 7.4000(a)(1).  There is some ambiguity in the NBAs term visitorial powers, and the Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the term within the bounds of that uncertainty.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837.  However, the presence of some uncertainty does not expand Chevron deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the NBA.  Pp. 23. 


(ii)When the NBA was enacted in 1864, scholars and courts understood visitation to refer to the sovereigns supervisory power over the manner in which corporations conducted business, see, e.g., Guthrie v. Harkness, 199 U. S. 148, 157.  That power allowed the States to use the prerogative writs to exercise control if a corporation abused its lawful power, acted adversely to the public, or created a nuisance.  Pp.34. 


(iii)This Courts consistent teaching, both before and after the NBAs enactment, is that a sovereigns visitorial powers and its power to enforce the law are two different things.  See, e.g., Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681; Guthrie, supra, at 159, 157; First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S. 640, 660.  Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 550 U. S. 1, 21, distinguished.  And contrary to the Comptrollers regulation, the NBA pre-empts only the former.  Pp. 47. 


(iv)The regulations consequences also cast its validity into doubt: Even the OCC acknowledges that the NBA leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks, yet the Comptrollers rule says that the State may not enforce its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks.  To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.  St. Louis, supra, at 660. In contrast, channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise visitorial oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congresss decision not to pre-empt substantive state law.  This reading is also suggested by 484(a)s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers vested in the courts of justice.  And on a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear: If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, its targets are protected by discovery and procedural rules.  Pp. 79. 


(b)The Comptrollers interpretation of the regulation demonstrates its own flaw: the Comptroller is forced to limit the regulations sweep in areas such as contract enforcement and debt collection, but those exceptions rest upon neither the regulations nor the NBAs text.  Pp. 911.  


(c)The dissents objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp. 1113. 


(d)Under the foregoing principles, the Comptroller reasonably interpreted the NBAs visitorial powers term to include conducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, when the State conducts those activities as supervisor of corporations.  When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather sovereign-as-law-enforcer.  Because such a lawsuit is not an exercise of visitorial powers, the Comptroller erred by extending that term to include prosecuting enforcement actions in state courts.  In this case, the Attorney Generals threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but the issuance of subpoena on his own authority if his request for information was not voluntarily honored.  That is not the exercise of the law enforcement power vested in the courts of justice, which the NBA exempts from the ban on the exercise of supervisory power.  Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the Attorney Generals threatened issuance of executive subpoenas, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.  Pp. 1315.

07-591|"MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS
certiorari to the appeals court of massachusetts
No. 07591.Argued November 10, 2008Decided June 25, 2009
At petitioners state-court drug trial, the prosecution introduced certificates of state laboratory analysts stating that material seized by police and connected to petitioner was cocaine of a certain quantity.  As required by Massachusetts law, the certificates were sworn to before a notary public and were submitted as prima facie evidence of what they asserted.  Petitioner objected, asserting that Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, required the analysts to testify in person. The trial court disagreed, the certificates were admitted, and petitioner was convicted.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed, rejecting petitioners claim that the certificates admission violated the Sixth Amendment.
Held:The admission of the certificates violated petitioners Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.  Pp.323.
(a) Under Crawford, a witnesss testimony against a defendant is inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  541 U. S., at 54.  The certificates here are affidavits, which fall within the core class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause, id., at 51.  They asserted that the substance found in petitioners possession was, as the prosecution claimed, cocaine of a certain weightthe precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial.  Not only were the certificates made, as Crawford required for testimonial statements, under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial, id., at 52, but under the relevant Massachusetts law their sole purpose was to provide prima facie evidence of the substances composition, quality, and net weight.  Petitioner was entitled to be confronted with the persons giving this testimony at trial.  Id., at 54.  Pp.35.


(b)The arguments advanced to avoid this rather straightforward application of Crawford are rejected.  Respondents claim that the analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not accusatory witnesses finds no support in the Sixth Amendments text or in this Courts case law.  The affiants testimonial statements were not nearly contemporaneous with their observations, nor, if they had been, would that fact alter the statements testimonial character.  There is no support for the proposition that witnesses who testify regarding facts other than those observed at the crime scene are exempt from confrontation.  The absence of interrogation is irrelevant; a witness who volunteers his testimony is no less a witness for Sixth Amendment purposes.  The affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records.

			"|"MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS
certiorari to the appeals court of massachusetts
No. 07591.Argued November 10, 2008Decided June 25, 2009
At petitioners state-court drug trial, the prosecution introduced certificates of state laboratory analysts stating that material seized by police and connected to petitioner was cocaine of a certain quantity.  As required by Massachusetts law, the certificates were sworn to before a notary public and were submitted as prima facie evidence of what they asserted.  Petitioner objected, asserting that Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, required the analysts to testify in person. The trial court disagreed, the certificates were admitted, and petitioner was convicted.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed, rejecting petitioners claim that the certificates admission violated the Sixth Amendment.
Held:The admission of the certificates violated petitioners Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.  Pp.323.
(a) Under Crawford, a witnesss testimony against a defendant is inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  541 U. S., at 54.  The certificates here are affidavits, which fall within the core class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause, id., at 51.  They asserted that the substance found in petitioners possession was, as the prosecution claimed, cocaine of a certain weightthe precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial.  Not only were the certificates made, as Crawford required for testimonial statements, under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial, id., at 52, but under the relevant Massachusetts law their sole purpose was to provide prima facie evidence of the substances composition, quality, and net weight.  Petitioner was entitled to be confronted with the persons giving this testimony at trial.  Id., at 54.  Pp.35.


(b)The arguments advanced to avoid this rather straightforward application of Crawford are rejected.  Respondents claim that the analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not accusatory witnesses finds no support in the Sixth Amendments text or in this Courts case law.  The affiants testimonial statements were not nearly contemporaneous with their observations, nor, if they had been, would that fact alter the statements testimonial character.  There is no support for the proposition that witnesses who testify regarding facts other than those observed at the crime scene are exempt from confrontation.  The absence of interrogation is irrelevant; a witness who volunteers his testimony is no less a witness for Sixth Amendment purposes.  The affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records.  The argument that the analysts should not be subject to confrontation because their statements result from neutral scientific testing is little more than an invitation to return to the since-overruled decision in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66, which held that evidence with particularized guarantees of trustworthiness was admissible without confrontation.  Petitioners power to subpoena the analysts is no substitute for the right of confrontation.  Finally, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause may not be relaxed because they make the prosecutions task burdensome.

08-214|"ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO., INC., etal. v. 
TOWNSEND
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 08214.Argued March 2, 2009Decided June 25, 2009
Atlantic Sounding Co. allegedly refused to pay maintenance and cure to respondent Townsend for injuries he suffered while working on its tugboat, and then filed this declaratory relief action regarding its obligations.  Townsend filed suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law, alleging, inter alia, arbitrary and willful failure to provide maintenance and cure.  He filed similar counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the maintenance and cure claim.  The District Court denied petitioners motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim, but certified the question for interlocutory appeal.  Following its precedent, the Eleventh Circuit held that punitive damages may be awarded for the willful withholding of maintenance and cure.
Held:Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy under general maritime law, and because neither Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, nor the Jones Act altered this understanding, punitive damages for the willful and wanton disregard of the maintenance and cure obligation remain available as a matter of general maritime law.  Pp.219.
(a)Settled legal principles establish three points central to this case.  Pp.29.


(i)Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.  English law during the colonial era accorded juries the authority to award such damages when warranted.  And American courts have likewise permitted such damages since at least 1784.  This Court has also found punitive damages authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.  See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363.  Pp.35.


(ii)The common-law punitive damages tradition extends to claims arising under federal maritime law.  See Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108.  One of this Courts first cases so indicating involved an action for marine trespass.  See The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546.  And lower federal courts have found punitive damages available in maritime actions for particularly egregious tortious acts.  Pp.56.


(iii)Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rules applicability in the maintenance and cure context.  The maintenance and cure obligation dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime law, and the failure of a seamans employers to provide adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages in cases decided in the 1800s.  This Court has since registered its agreement with such decisions and has subsequently found that in addition to wages, maintenance includes food and lodging at the ships expense, and cure refers to medical treatment, Lewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441.  Moreover, an owners failure to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided lower courts the impetus to award damages that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  Pp.78.


(iv)Under these settled legal principles, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation that departs from the common-law understanding.  P.9.


(b)The plain language of the Jones Act does not provide a basis for overturning the common-law rule.  Congress enacted the Jones Act to overrule The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, where the Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers negligence.  To that end, the Act created a statutory negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based on maintenance and cure.  The Act bestows the right to elect to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamennot an exclusive remedy.  Because the then-accepted remedies arose from general maritime law, it necessarily follows that Congress envisioned their continued availability.  See Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354.  Had the Jones Act been the only remaining remedy available, there would have been no election to make.  And, the only statutory restrictions on general maritime maintenance and cure claims were enacted long after the Jones Acts passage and limit availability for only two discrete classes:foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities and sailing school students and instructors.  This indicates that Congress knows how to restrict the traditional maintenance and cure remedy when it wants to.  Omni Capital Intl, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106.  This Court has consistently observed that the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as maintenance and cure, see. e.g., The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110, and its case law supports the view that punitive damages awards, in particular, continue to remain available in maintenance and cure actions, see Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527.  Pp.913.


(i)Contrary to petitioners argument, Miles does not limit recovery to the remedies available under the Jones Act.  Miles does not address either maintenance and cure actions in general or the availability of punitive damages for such actions.  Instead, it grappled with the entirely different question whether general maritime law should provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness.  The Court found that the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported recognition of a general maritime rule for wrongful death of a seaman.  However, since Congress had chosen to limit the damages available in the Jones Act and DOHSA, excluding damages for loss of society or lost future earnings, 498 U. S., at 21, 3132, its judgment must control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, id., at 3236.  Miles reasoning does not apply here.  Unlike Miles situation, both the general maritime cause of action here (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the Jones Acts passage.  And unlike Miles facts, the Jones Act does not address the general maritime cause of action here or its remedy.  It is thus possible to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions and remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a matter to which Congress has spoken directly.  See id., at 31.  Moreover, petitioners contrary view was directly rejected in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 820.  If Miles presented no barrier to the Garris Courts endorsement of a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, there is no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion here.  Like negligence, the duty of maintenance and cure and the general availability of punitive damages have been recognized for more than a century, 532 U. S., at 820.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or expand the maritime tort laws general principles, Miles does not require eliminating the general maritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure.  The fact that seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for maintenance and cure claims, does not mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy.  See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374375.  The laudable quest for uniformity in admiralty does not require narrowing available damages to the lowest common denominator approved by Congress for distinct causes of action.  Pp.1319.
496 F.3d 1282, affirmed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined.

INSTRUCTION v. FLORES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 08289.Argued April 20, 2009Decided June 25, 2009
A group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defendants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers in schools, 20 U. S.C. 1703(f).  In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not related to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales.   The District Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years following, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions.  The defendants did not appeal any of the District Courts orders.  In 2006, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, increased ELL incremental funding.  The incremental funding increase required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.  The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.  The Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superintendent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in light of HB 2064.  In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5).  The District Court denied their motion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule 60(b)(5) claim.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted Rule 60(b)(5).  On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding system.  Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant relief.  
Held:
1.The superintendent has standing.  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendants challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561.  Here, the superintendent was a named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in violation of the EEOA, and the injunction runs against him.  Because the superintendent has standing, the Court need not consider whether the Legislators also have standing.  Pp.810.


2.The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under Rule 60(b)(5).  Pp.1034.


(a)Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a judgment or order if a significant change either in factual conditions or in law renders continued enforcement detrimental to the public interest, Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384, serves a particularly important function in institutional reform litigation, id., at 380.  Injunctions in institutional reform cases often remain in force for many years, during which time changed circumstances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment.  Injunctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns, which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.  Finally, institutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their predecessors policy preferences and may thereby improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.  Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441.  Because of these features of institutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a flexible approach to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, Rufo, supra, at 381, ensuring that responsibility for discharging the States obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials when circumstances warrant, Frew, supra, at 442.  Courts must remain attentive to the fact that federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or  flow from such a violation.  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282.  Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been remedied.  If it has, the orders continued enforcement is unnecessary and improper.  Pp.1014.


(b)The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis just described.  Pp.1423.


(i)Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict.  The Court of Appeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are likely rare, and that, to succeed, petitioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to sweep away the District Courts incremental funding determination.  The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism concerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the State Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.  Pp.1415.


(ii)The Court of Appeals inquiry was also too narrow, focusing almost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding.  It attributed undue significance to petitioners failure to appeal the District Courts 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexible changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo.  The Court of Appeals inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000 order had been satisfied.  But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is only one of Rule 60(b)(5)s enumerated bases for relief.  Petitioners could obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective enforcement of the order was no longer equitable.  To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained whether the 2000 orders ongoing enforcement was supported by an ongoing EEOA violation.  Although the EEOA requires a State to take appropriate action, it entrusts state and local authorities with choosing how to meet this obligation.  By focusing solely on ELL incremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this mandate.  And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate appropriate action through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly substituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local officials entrusted with the decisions.  Pp.1518.


(c)The District Courts opinion reveals similar errors.  Rather than determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief from the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied that order through increased ELL incremental funding.  Pp.1820.


(d)Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misperceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four factual and legal changes that may warrant relief. Pp.2334.


(i)After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a bilingual education methodology of ELL instruction to structured English immersion (SEI).  Research on ELL instruction and findings by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding whether Nogales implementation of SEI is a changed circumstance warranting relief.  Pp.2325.


(ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant changed circumstance.   Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute appropriate action under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to petitioners Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted the State to make significant structural and programming changes in its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales ELL students through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a shift in federal education policy.  Pp.2529.


(iii)Nogales superintendent instituted significant structural and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of teachers.  Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought Nogales ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.  This was error.  Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educational programming and services to students, not the amount of money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL programming in ways other than through increased incremental funding.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.  Pp. 2932.


(iv)There was an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.  The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to support EEOA-compliant ELL programming.  This was clear legal error.  The EEOAs appropriate action requirement does not necessarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come from a particular source.  Thus, the District Court should evaluate whether the States general education funding budget, in addition to local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.  Pp.3234.


3.On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief.  The record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA can justify a statewide injunction here.  The state attorney generals concern that a Nogales only remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Constitutions equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid basis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question to be determined by state authorities.  Unless the District Court concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.  Pp. 3436.

The defendants did not appeal any of the District Courts orders.  In 2006, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, increased ELL incremental funding.  The incremental funding increase required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.  The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.  The Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superintendent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in light of HB 2064.  In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5).  The District Court denied their motion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule 60(b)(5) claim.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted Rule 60(b)(5).  On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding system.  Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant relief.  
Held:
1.The superintendent has standing.  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendants challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561.  Here, the superintendent was a named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in violation of the EEOA, and the injunction runs against him.  Because the superintendent has standing, the Court need not consider whether the Legislators also have standing.  Pp.810.


2.The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under Rule 60(b)(5).  Pp.1034.


(a)Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a judgment or order if a significant change either in factual conditions or in law renders continued enforcement detrimental to the public interest, Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384, serves a particularly important function in institutional reform litigation, id., at 380.  Injunctions in institutional reform cases often remain in force for many years, during which time changed circumstances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment.  Injunctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns, which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.  Finally, institutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their predecessors policy preferences and may thereby improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.  Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441.  Because of these features of institutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a flexible approach to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, Rufo, supra, at 381, ensuring that responsibility for discharging the States obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials when circumstances warrant, Frew, supra, at 442.  Courts must remain attentive to the fact that federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or  flow from such a violation.  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282.  Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been remedied.  If it has, the orders continued enforcement is unnecessary and improper.  Pp.1014.


(b)The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis just described.  Pp.1423.


(i)Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict.  The Court of Appeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are likely rare, and that, to succeed, petitioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to sweep away the District Courts incremental funding determination.  The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism concerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the State Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.  Pp.1415.


(ii)The Court of Appeals inquiry was also too narrow, focusing almost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding.  It attributed undue significance to petitioners failure to appeal the District Courts 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexible changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo.  The Court of Appeals inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000 order had been satisfied.  But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is only one of Rule 60(b)(5)s enumerated bases for relief.  Petitioners could obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective enforcement of the order was no longer equitable.  To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained whether the 2000 orders ongoing enforcement was supported by an ongoing EEOA violation.  Although the EEOA requires a State to take appropriate action, it entrusts state and local authorities with choosing how to meet this obligation.  By focusing solely on ELL incremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this mandate.  And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate appropriate action through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly substituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local officials entrusted with the decisions.  Pp.1518.


(c)The District Courts opinion reveals similar errors.  Rather than determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief from the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied that order through increased ELL incremental funding.  Pp.1820.


(d)Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misperceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four factual and legal changes that may warrant relief. Pp.2334.


(i)After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a bilingual education methodology of ELL instruction to structured English immersion (SEI).  Research on ELL instruction and findings by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding whether Nogales implementation of SEI is a changed circumstance warranting relief.  Pp.2325.


(ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant changed circumstance.   Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute appropriate action under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to petitioners Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted the State to make significant structural and programming changes in its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales ELL students through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a shift in federal education policy.  Pp.2529.


(iii)Nogales superintendent instituted significant structural and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of teachers.  Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought Nogales ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.  This was error.  Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educational programming and services to students, not the amount of money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL programming in ways other than through increased incremental funding.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.  Pp. 2932.


(iv)There was an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.  The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to support EEOA-compliant ELL programming.  This was clear legal error.  The EEOAs appropriate action requirement does not necessarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come from a particular source.  Thus, the District Court should evaluate whether the States general education funding budget, in addition to local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.  Pp.3234.


3.On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief.  The record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA can justify a statewide injunction here.  The state attorney generals concern that a Nogales only remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Constitutions equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid basis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question to be determined by state authorities.  Unless the District Court concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.  Pp. 3436.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 08479.Argued April 21, 2009Decided June 25, 2009
After escorting 13-year-old Savana Redding from her middle school classroom to his office, Assistant Principal Wilson showed her a day planner containing knives and other contraband.  She admitted owning the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa and that the contraband was not hers.  He then produced four prescription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of which are banned under school rules without advance permission.  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report that she was giving pills to fellow students.  She denied it and agreed to let him search her belongings.  He and Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, searched Savanas backpack, finding nothing.  Wilson then had Romero take Savana to the school nurses office to search her clothes for pills.  After Romero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.  No pills were found.  Savanas mother filed suit against petitioner school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging that the strip search violated Savanas Fourth Amendment rights.  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted the motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed.  Following the protocol for evaluating qualified immunity claims, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set out in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325.  It then applied the test for qualified immunity.  Finding that Savanas right was clearly established at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judgment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because they were not independent decisionmakers.  
Held: 
1.The search of Savanas underwear violated the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.311.


(a)For school searches, the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause. T.L.O., 469 U. S., at 341.  Under the resulting reasonable suspicion standard, a school search will be permissible  when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.  Id., at 342.  The required knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school administrators evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.  Pp.35.


(b)Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savanas backpack and outer clothing.  A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills.  On the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came from Marissa.  Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wilson called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.  Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, inter alia, an over-the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savanas.  She also denied knowing about the day planners contents.  Wilson did not ask her when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be hiding them.  After a search of Marissas underwear by Romero and Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his office.  He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relationship with Marissa.  He knew that the girls had been identified as part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls bathroom.  He had other reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Savanas house where alcohol was served.  Thus, Marissas statement that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution.  A student who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her backpack.  Looking into Savanas bag, in her presence and in the relative privacy of Wilsons office, was not excessively intrusive, any more than Romeros subsequent search of her outer clothing.  Pp.58.


(c)Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indicate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed in her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant extending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her underwear.  Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything when Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its Fourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking and how much was seen.  Savanas actions in their presence necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.  Savanas subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating.  The reasonableness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the exposures patent intrusiveness.  Its indignity does not outlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that the search [be] reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place. T.L.O., supra, at 341.  Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion.  Because Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he must have known of their nature and limited threat and had no reason to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that individual students had great quantities.  Nor could he have suspected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.  When suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intrusiveness of a search down to an adolescents body, petitioners general belief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a reasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will succeed.  Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such behavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that Savana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.  Wilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the pills on her person, much less in her underwear.  Pp.811.  


2.Although the strip search violated Savanas Fourth Amendment rights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from liability by qualified immunity because clearly established law [did] not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  The intrusiveness of the strip search here cannot, under T.L.O., be seen as justifiably related to the circumstances, but lower court cases viewing school strip searches differently are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting opinions, to counsel doubt about the clarity with which the right was previously stated.  Pp.1113.


3.The issue of petitioner Saffords liability under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694, should be addressed on remand.  P.13.

07-984|"COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA
CONSERVATION COUNCIL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07984.Argued January 12, 2009Decided June 22, 2009
In reviving a closed Alaska gold mine using a froth flotation technique, petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc., plans to dispose of the resulting waste material, a rock and water mixture called slurry, by pumping it into a nearby lake and then discharging purified lake water into a downstream creek.  The Clean Water Act (CWA), inter alia, classifies crushed rock as a pollutant, 352(6); forbids its discharge [e]xcept as in compliance with the Act, 301(a); empowers the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to issue permits  for the discharge of  fill material, 404(a); and authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, [e]xcept as provided in [404], 402(a).  The Corps and the EPA together define fill material as any material [that] has the effect of [c]hanging the bottom elevation of water, including slurry  or similar mining-related materials.  40 CFR 232.2.  Coeur Alaska obtained a 404 permit for the slurry discharge from the Corps and a 402 permit for the lake water discharge from the EPA.


Respondent environmental groups (collectively, SEACC) sued the Corps and several of its officials under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the CWA 404 permit was not in accordance with law, 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A), because (1) Coeur Alaska should have sought a CWA 402 permit from the EPA instead, just as it did for the lake water discharge; and (2) the slurry discharge would violate the new source performance standard the EPA had promulgated under CWA 306(b), forbidding froth-flotation gold mines to discharge process wastewater, which includes solid wastes, 40 CFR 440.104(b)(1).  Coeur Alaska and petitioner Alaska intervened as defendants.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the proposed slurry discharge would violate the EPAs performance standard and 306(e). 
Held:
1.The Corps, not the EPA, has authority to permit the slurry discharge.  Pp.913.


(a)By specifying that, [e]xcept as provided in  [404,] the EPA may  issue permit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant, 402(a) forbids the EPA to issue permits for fill materials falling under the Corps 404 authority.  Even if there were ambiguity on this point, it would be resolved by the EPAs own regulation providing that [d]ischarges of  fill material  which are regulated under section 404 do not require [EPA 402] permits.  40 CFR 122.3.  The agencies have interpreted this regulation to essentially restate 402s text, ibid., and the EPA has confirmed that reading before this Court.  Because it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, the Court accepts the EPAs interpretation as correct.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  Thus, the question whether the EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge depends on whether the Corps has authority to do so.  If so, the EPA may not regulate.  Pp.911. 


(b)Because 404(a) empowers the Corps to issue permits for the discharge of  fill material, and the agencies joint regulation defines fill material to include slurry  or similar mining-related materials having the effect of  [c]hanging the bottom elevation of water, 40 CFR 232.2, the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge into the lake falls well within the Corps 404 permitting authority, rather than the EPAs 402 authority.  The CWA gives no indication that Congress intended to burden industry with the confusing division of permitting authority that SEACCs contrary reading would create.  Pp.1113.


2.The Corps acted in accordance with law in issuing the slurry discharge permit to Coeur Alaska.  Pp.1328. 


(a)The CWA alone does not resolve these cases.  Pp.1418.  


(i)SEACC contends that because the EPAs performance standard forbids even minute solid waste discharges, 40 CFR 440.104(b)(1), it also forbids Coeur Alaskas slurry discharge, 30% of which is solid waste, into the lake.  Thus, says SEACC, the slurry discharge is unlawful under CWA 306(e), which prohibits any owner  of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.  Pp.1416.  


(ii)Petitioners and the federal agencies counter that CWA 404 grants the Corps authority to determine whether to issue a permit allowing the slurry discharge without regard to the EPAs new source performance standard or 306(e)s prohibition.  Pp.1618.


(iii)The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether 306 applies to discharges of fill material regulated under 404.  On the one hand, 306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new source performance standard is unlawfulwithout an exception for fill material.  On the other hand, 404 grants the Corps blanket authority to permit the discharge of fill materialwithout mentioning 306.  This tension indicates that Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842.  P.18.


(b)Although the agencies regulations construing the CWA are entitled to deference if they resolve the statutory ambiguity in a reasonable manner, see Chevron, supra, at 842, the regulations bearing on 306 and 404, like the CWA itself, do not do so.  For example, each of the two principal regulations seems to stand on its own without reference to the other.  The EPAs performance standard contains no exception for fill material, and it forbids any discharge of process wastewater, including solid wastes.  40 CFR 440.104(b)(1).  The agencies joint regulation defining fill material includes slurry or  similar mining-related materials, 232.2, but contains no exception for slurry regulated by an EPA performance standard.  Additional regulations noted by the parties offer no basis for reconciliation.  Pp.1820.  


(c)In light of the ambiguities in the CWA and the pertinent regulations, the Court turns to the agencies subsequent interpretation of those regulations.  Auer, supra, at 461.  The question at issue is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the two agencies practice and policy, as recited in the EPAs internal Regas Memorandum (Memorandum), which explains that the performance standard applies only to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek, and not to the initial discharge of slurry into the lake.  Though the Memorandum is not subject to sufficiently formal procedures to merit full Chevron deference, the Court defers to it because it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s], Auer, supra, at 461.  Five factors inform that conclusion: The Memorandum (1) confines its own scope to closed bodies of water like the lake here, thereby preserving a role for the performance standards; (2) guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards; (3) employs the Corps expertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the aquatic environment; (4) does not allow toxic compounds to be discharged into navigable waters; and (5) reconciles 306, 402, and 404, and the regulations implementing them, better than any of the parties alternatives.  The Court agrees with the parties that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and regulations.  Pp.2023.  


(d)The Court rejects SEACCs contention that the Regas Memorandum is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the agencies published statements and prior practice.  Though SEACC cites three such statements, its arguments are not convincing.  Pp.2328.  


(i)Although a 1986 memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the EPA and the Corps seeking to reconcile their then-differing fill material definitions suggests, as SEACC asserts, that 402 will normally apply to discharges of suspendedi.e., solidpollutants, that statement is not contrary to the Regas Memorandum, which acknowledges that the EPA retains authority under 402 to regulate the discharge of suspended solids from the lake into downstream waters.  The MOA does not address the question presented by these cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, and is, in fact, consistent with the agencies determination that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill material and that 306 does not apply to these discharges.  Pp.2325.  


(ii)Despite SEACCs assertion that the fill regulations preamble demonstrates that the fill rule was not intended to displace the pre-existing froth-flotation gold mine performance standard, the preamble is consistent with the Regas Memorandum when it explicitly notes that the EPA has never sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines, 67 Fed. Reg. 31135.  If a discharge does not qualify as fill, the EPAs new source performance standard applies.  If the discharge qualifies as fill, the performance standard does not apply; and there was no earlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.  Pp.2526.  


(iii)Remarks made by the two agencies in promulgating the fill regulation, which pledge that the EPAs previou[s]  determination[s] with regard to the application of performance standards remain vali[d], are not conclusive of the question at issue.  The Regas Memorandum has followed this policy by applying the performance standard to the discharge of water from the lake into the creek.  The remarks do not state that the EPA will apply such standards to discharges of fill material.  Pp.2627.  


(iv)While SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has applied a performance standard to a discharge of fill material, Coeur Alaska cites two instances in which the Corps issued a 404 permit authorizing a mine to discharge solid waste as fill material.  These permits illustrate that the agencies did not have a prior practice of applying EPA performance standards to discharges of mining wastes that qualify as fill material.  Pp.2728.

			"|"COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA
CONSERVATION COUNCIL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07984.Argued January 12, 2009Decided June 22, 2009
In reviving a closed Alaska gold mine using a froth flotation technique, petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc., plans to dispose of the resulting waste material, a rock and water mixture called slurry, by pumping it into a nearby lake and then discharging purified lake water into a downstream creek.  The Clean Water Act (CWA), inter alia, classifies crushed rock as a pollutant, 352(6); forbids its discharge [e]xcept as in compliance with the Act, 301(a); empowers the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to issue permits  for the discharge of  fill material, 404(a); and authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, [e]xcept as provided in [404], 402(a).  The Corps and the EPA together define fill material as any material [that] has the effect of [c]hanging the bottom elevation of water, including slurry  or similar mining-related materials.  40 CFR 232.2.  Coeur Alaska obtained a 404 permit for the slurry discharge from the Corps and a 402 permit for the lake water discharge from the EPA.


Respondent environmental groups (collectively, SEACC) sued the Corps and several of its officials under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the CWA 404 permit was not in accordance with law, 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A), because (1) Coeur Alaska should have sought a CWA 402 permit from the EPA instead, just as it did for the lake water discharge; and (2) the slurry discharge would violate the new source performance standard the EPA had promulgated under CWA 306(b), forbidding froth-flotation gold mines to discharge process wastewater, which includes solid wastes, 40 CFR 440.104(b)(1).  Coeur Alaska and petitioner Alaska intervened as defendants.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the proposed slurry discharge would violate the EPAs performance standard and 306(e). 
Held:
1.The Corps, not the EPA, has authority to permit the slurry discharge.  Pp.913.


(a)By specifying that, [e]xcept as provided in  [404,] the EPA may  issue permit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant, 402(a) forbids the EPA to issue permits for fill materials falling under the Corps 404 authority.  Even if there were ambiguity on this point, it would be resolved by the EPAs own regulation providing that [d]ischarges of  fill material  which are regulated under section 404 do not require [EPA 402] permits.  40 CFR 122.3.  The agencies have interpreted this regulation to essentially restate 402s text, ibid., and the EPA has confirmed that reading before this Court.  Because it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, the Court accepts the EPAs interpretation as correct.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  Thus, the question whether the EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge depends on whether the Corps has authority to do so.  If so, the EPA may not regulate.  Pp.911. 


(b)Because 404(a) empowers the Corps to issue permits for the discharge of  fill material, and the agencies joint regulation defines fill material to include slurry  or similar mining-related materials having the effect of  [c]hanging the bottom elevation of water, 40 CFR 232.2, the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge into the lake falls well within the Corps 404 permitting authority, rather than the EPAs 402 authority.  The CWA gives no indication that Congress intended to burden industry with the confusing division of permitting authority that SEACCs contrary reading would create.  Pp.1113.


2.The Corps acted in accordance with law in issuing the slurry discharge permit to Coeur Alaska.  Pp.1328. 


(a)The CWA alone does not resolve these cases.  Pp.1418.  


(i)SEACC contends that because the EPAs performance standard forbids even minute solid waste discharges, 40 CFR 440.104(b)(1), it also forbids Coeur Alaskas slurry discharge, 30% of which is solid waste, into the lake.  Thus, says SEACC, the slurry discharge is unlawful under CWA 306(e), which prohibits any owner  of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.  Pp.1416.  


(ii)Petitioners and the federal agencies counter that CWA 404 grants the Corps authority to determine whether to issue a permit allowing the slurry discharge without regard to the EPAs new source performance standard or 306(e)s prohibition.  Pp.1618.


(iii)The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether 306 applies to discharges of fill material regulated under 404.  On the one hand, 306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new source performance standard is unlawfulwithout an exception for fill material.  On the other hand, 404 grants the Corps blanket authority to permit the discharge of fill materialwithout mentioning 306.  This tension indicates that Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842.  P.18.


(b)Although the agencies regulations construing the CWA are entitled to deference if they resolve the statutory ambiguity in a reasonable manner, see Chevron, supra, at 842, the regulations bearing on 306 and 404, like the CWA itself, do not do so.  For example, each of the two principal regulations seems to stand on its own without reference to the other.  The EPAs performance standard contains no exception for fill material, and it forbids any discharge of process wastewater, including solid wastes.  40 CFR 440.104(b)(1).  The agencies joint regulation defining fill material includes slurry or  similar mining-related materials, 232.2, but contains no exception for slurry regulated by an EPA performance standard.  Additional regulations noted by the parties offer no basis for reconciliation.  Pp.1820.  


(c)In light of the ambiguities in the CWA and the pertinent regulations, the Court turns to the agencies subsequent interpretation of those regulations.  Auer, supra, at 461.  The question at issue is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the two agencies practice and policy, as recited in the EPAs internal Regas Memorandum (Memorandum), which explains that the performance standard applies only to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek, and not to the initial discharge of slurry into the lake.  Though the Memorandum is not subject to sufficiently formal procedures to merit full Chevron deference, the Court defers to it because it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s], Auer, supra, at 461.  Five factors inform that conclusion: The Memorandum (1) confines its own scope to closed bodies of water like the lake here, thereby preserving a role for the performance standards; (2) guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards; (3) employs the Corps expertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the aquatic environment; (4) does not allow toxic compounds to be discharged into navigable waters; and (5) reconciles 306, 402, and 404, and the regulations implementing them, better than any of the parties alternatives.  The Court agrees with the parties that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and regulations.  Pp.2023.

08-305|"FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT v. T. A.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 08305.Argued April 28, 2009Decided June 22, 2009
After a private specialist diagnosed respondent with learning disabilities, his parents unilaterally removed him from petitioner public school district (School District), enrolled him in a private academy, and requested an administrative hearing on his eligibility for special-education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S.C. 1400 et seq.  The School District found respondent ineligible for such services and declined to offer him an individualized education program (IEP).  Concluding that the School District had failed to provide respondent a free appropriate public education as required by IDEA, 1412(a)(1)(A), and that respondents private-school placement was appropriate, the hearing officer ordered the School District to reimburse his parents for his private-school tuition.  The District Court set aside the award, holding that the IDEA Amendments of 1997 (Amendments) categorically bar reimbursement unless a child has previously received special education or related services under the [schools] authority.  1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Amendments did not diminish the authority of courts to grant reimbursement as appropriate relief pursuant to 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359, 370.  
Held:IDEA authorizes reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special-education services through the public school.  Pp.617.
(a)This Court held in Burlington and Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7, that 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) authorizes courts to reimburse parents for the cost of private-school tuition when a school district fails to provide a child a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate.   That Burlington and Carter involved the deficiency of a proposed IEP does not distinguish this case, nor does the fact that the children in Burlington and Carter had previously received special-education services; the Courts decision in those cases depended on the Acts language and purpose rather than the particular facts involved.  Thus, the reasoning of Burlington and Carter applies unless the 1997 Amendments require a different result.  Pp.68. 


(b)The 1997 Amendments do not impose a categorical bar to reimbursement.  The Amendments made no change to the central purpose of IDEA or the text of 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  Because Congress is presumed to be aware of, and to adopt, a judicial interpretation of a statute when it reenacts that law without change, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580, this Court will continue to read 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize reimbursement absent a clear indication that Congress intended to repeal the provision or abrogate Burlington and Carter.  The School Districts argument that 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) limits reimbursement to children who have previously received public special-education services is unpersuasive for several reasons: It is not supported by IDEAs text, as the 1997 Amendments do not expressly prohibit reimbursement in this case and the School District offers no evidence that Congress intended to supersede Burlington and Carter; it is at odds with IDEAs remedial purpose of ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a [FAPE] that emphasizes special education  designed to meet their unique needs, 1400(d)(1)(A); and it would produce a rule bordering on the irrational by providing a remedy when a school offers a child inadequate special-education services but leaving parents remediless when the school unreasonably denies access to such services altogether.  Pp.815. 


(c)The School Districts argument that any conditions on accepting IDEA funds must be stated unambiguously is clearly satisfied here, as States have been on notice at least since Burlington that IDEA authorizes courts to order reimbursement.  The School Districts claims that respondents reading will impose a heavy financial burden on public schools and encourage parents to enroll their children in private school without first trying to cooperate with public-school authorities are also unpersuasive in light of the restrictions on reimbursement awards identified in Burlington and the fact that parents unilaterally change their childs placement at their own financial risk.  See, e.g., Carter, 510 U. S., at 15.  Pp.1516.  
523 F.3d 1078, affirmed.

08-322|"NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTILITY
DISTRICT NUMBER ONE v. HOLDER,
ATTORNEY GENERAL, etal.
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 08322.Argued April 29, 2009Decided June 22, 2009
The appellant is a small utility district with an elected board.  Because it is located in Texas, it is required by 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) to seek federal preclearance before it can change anything about its elections, even though there is no evidence it has ever discriminated on the basis of race in those elections.  The district filed suit seeking relief under the bailout provision in 4(a) of the Act, which allows a political subdivision to be released from the preclearance requirements if certain conditions are met.  The district argued in the alternative that, if 5 were interpreted to render it ineligible for bailout, 5 was unconstitutional.  The Federal District Court rejected both claims.  It concluded that bailout under 4(a) is available only to counties, parishes, and subunits that register voters, not to an entity like the district that does not register its own voters.  It also concluded that a 2006 amendment extending 5 for 25 years was constitutional.
Held: 
1.The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable, but the Act now raises serious constitutional concerns.  The preclearance requirement represents an intrusion into areas of state and local responsibility that is otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.  Some of the conditions that the Court relied upon in upholding this statutory scheme in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, and City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, have unquestionably improved.  Those improvements are no doubt due in significant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monument to its success, but the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.  The Act also differentiates between the States in ways that may no longer be justified.


At the same time, the Court recognizes that judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform.  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147148 (Holmes, J., concurring).  Here the District Court found that the sizable record compiled by Congress to support extension of 5 documented continuing racial discrimination and that 5 deterred discriminatory changes.  


The Court will not shrink from its duty as the bulwark of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, The Federalist No. 78, but [i]t is  well established that normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case, Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51.  Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out under 4 and 5, and that claim is sufficient to resolve the appeal.  Pp. 611.


2.The Act must be interpreted to permit all political subdivisions, including the district, to seek to bail out from the preclearance requirements.  It is undisputed that the district is a political subdivision in the ordinary sense, but the Act also provides a narrower definition in 14(c)(2): [P]olitical subdivision shall mean any county or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting.  The court below concluded that the district did not qualify for 4(a) bailout under this definition, but specific precedent, the Acts structure, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader reading.


This Court has already established that 14(c)(2)s definition does not apply to the term political subdivision in 5s preclearance provision.  See, e.g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Commrs, 435 U. S. 110.  Rather, the definition was intended to operate only for purposes of determining which political units in nondesignated States may be separately designated for coverage under 4(b).  Id., at 128129.  [O]nce a State has been [so] designated , [the] definition  has no operative significance in determining [5s] reach.  Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 44.  In light of these decisions, 14(c)(2)s definition should not constrict the availability of bailout either.  


The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by City of Rome.  In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City of Rome.  Thus, City of Romes logic is no longer applicable.  The Governments contention that the district is subject to 5 under Sheffield not because it is a political subdivision but because it is a State is counterintuitive and similarly untenable after the 1982 amendments.  The Governments contrary interpretation has helped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity.  Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictionsout of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisionshave successfully bailed out of the Act.  It is unlikely that Congress intended the provision to have such limited effect. Pp. 1117.

Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147148 (Holmes, J., concurring).  Here the District Court found that the sizable record compiled by Congress to support extension of 5 documented continuing racial discrimination and that 5 deterred discriminatory changes.  


The Court will not shrink from its duty as the bulwark of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, The Federalist No. 78, but [i]t is  well established that normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case, Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51.  Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out under 4 and 5, and that claim is sufficient to resolve the appeal.  Pp. 611.


2.The Act must be interpreted to permit all political subdivisions, including the district, to seek to bail out from the preclearance requirements.  It is undisputed that the district is a political subdivision in the ordinary sense, but the Act also provides a narrower definition in 14(c)(2): [P]olitical subdivision shall mean any county or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting.  The court below concluded that the district did not qualify for 4(a) bailout under this definition, but specific precedent, the Acts structure, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader reading.


This Court has already established that 14(c)(2)s definition does not apply to the term political subdivision in 5s preclearance provision.  See, e.g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Commrs, 435 U. S. 110.  Rather, the definition was intended to operate only for purposes of determining which political units in nondesignated States may be separately designated for coverage under 4(b).  Id., at 128129.  [O]nce a State has been [so] designated , [the] definition  has no operative significance in determining [5s] reach.  Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 44.  In light of these decisions, 14(c)(2)s definition should not constrict the availability of bailout either.  


The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by City of Rome.  In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City of Rome.  Thus, City of Romes logic is no longer applicable.  The Governments contention that the district is subject to 5 under Sheffield not because it is a political subdivision but because it is a State is counterintuitive and similarly untenable after the 1982 amendments.  The Governments contrary interpretation has helped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity.  Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictionsout of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisionshave successfully bailed out of the Act.  It is unlikely that Congress intended the provision to have such limited effect. Pp. 1117.

08-295|"TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. etal. v. BAILEY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 08295.Argued March 30, 2009Decided June 18, 2009
As part of the 1986 reorganization plan of the Johns-Manville Corporation (Manville), an asbestos supplier and manufacturer of asbestos-containing products, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement providing that Manvilles insurers, including The Travelers Indemnity Company and related companies (Travelers), would contribute to the corpus of the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Trust), and releasing those insurers from any Policy Claims, which were channeled to the Trust.  Policy Claims include, as relevant here, claims and allegations against the insurers based upon, arising out of or relating to the Manville insurance policies.  The settlement agreement and reorganization plan were approved by the Bankruptcy Court (1986 Orders) and were affirmed by the District Court and the Second Circuit.  Over a decade later plaintiffs began filing asbestos actions against Travelers in state courts (Direct Actions), often seeking to recover from Travelers not for Manvilles wrongdoing but for Travelers own alleged violations of state consumer-protection statutes or of common law duties.  Invoking the 1986 Orders, Travelers asked the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Actions.  Ultimately, a settlement was reached, in which Travelers agreed to make payments to compensate the Direct Action claimants, contingent on the courts order clarifying that the Direct Actions were, and remained, prohibited by the 1986 Orders.  The court made extensive factual findings, uncontested here, concluding that Travelers derived its knowledge of asbestos from its insurance relationship with Manville and that the Direct Actions are based on acts or omissions by Travelers arising from or related to the insurance policies.  It then approved the settlement and entered an order (Clarifying Order), which provided that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct Actions and various other claims.  Objectors to the settlement (respondents here) appealed.  The District Court affirmed, but the Second Circuit reversed.  Agreeing that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the 1986 Orders, the Circuit nevertheless held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Direct Actions because those actions sought not to recover based on Manvilles conduct, but to recover directly from Travelers for its own conduct.
Held:The terms of the injunction bar the Direct Actions against Travelers, and the finality of the Bankruptcy Courts 1986 Orders generally stands in the way of challenging their enforceability.  Pp.918.
(a)The Direct Actions are Policy Claims enjoined as against Travelers by the 1986 Orders, which covered, inter alia, claims and allegations relating to Travelers insurance coverage of Manville.  In a statute, [t]he phrase in relation to is expansive, Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 237, and so is its reach here.  While it would be possible to suggest that a claim only relates to Travelers insurance coverage if it seeks recovery based upon Travelers specific contractual obligation to Manville, allegations is not amenable to such a narrow construction and clearly reaches factual assertions that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers dealings with Manville.  The Bankruptcy Courts detailed factual findings place the Direct Actions within the terms of the 1986 Orders.  Contrary to respondents argument, the 1986 Orders contain no language limiting Policy Claims to claims derivative of Manvilles liability.  Even if, before the entry of the 1986 Orders, Travelers understood the proposed injunction to bar only such derivative claims, where a court orders plain terms unambiguously apply, as they do here, they are entitled to their effect.  If it is black-letter law that an unambiguous private contracts terms must be enforced irrespective of the parties subjective intent, it is also clear that a court, such as the Bankruptcy Court here, should enforce a court order, a public governmental act, according to its unambiguous terms.  Pp.1013.


(b)Because the 1986 Orders became final on direct review over two decades ago, whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction and authority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not properly before the Second Circuit in 2008 and is not properly before this Court.  The Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior orders, see Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 239, and it explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce its injunctions when it issued the 1986 Orders.  The Second Circuit erred in holding the 1986 Orders unenforceable according to their terms on the ground that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in 1986.  On direct appeal of the 1986 Orders, any objector was free to argue that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and the District Court or Court of Appeals could have raised such concerns sua sponte.  But once those orders became final on direct review, they became res judicata to the parties and those in privity with them.  Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 130.  So long as respondents or those in privity with them were parties to Manvilles bankruptcy proceeding, and were given a fair chance to challenge the Bankruptcy Courts subject-matter jurisdiction, they cannot challenge it now by resisting enforcement of the 1986 Orders.  The Second Circuits willingness to entertain this collateral attack cannot be squared with res judicata and the practical necessity served by that rule.  Almost a quarter-century after the 1986 Orders were entered, the time to prune them is over.  Pp.1316.


(c)This holding in narrow.  The Court neither resolves whether a bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtors wrongdoing, nor decides whether any particular respondent is bound by the 1986 Orders, which is a question that the Second Circuit did not consider.

08-441|"GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 08441.Argued March 31, 2009Decided June 18, 2009
Petitioner Gross filed suit, alleging that respondent (FBL) demoted him in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee because of such individuals age, 29 U. S.C. 623(a).  At the close of trial, and over FBLs objections, the District Court instructed the jury to enter a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was demoted and his age was a motivating factor in the demotion decision, and told the jury that age was a motivating factor if it played a part in the demotion.  It also instructed the jury to return a verdict for FBL if it proved that it would have demoted Gross regardless of age.  The jury returned a verdict for Gross.  The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, for cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerationsi.e., a mixed-motives case.  
Held:A plaintiff bringing an ADEA disparate-treatment claim must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the but-for cause of the challenged adverse employment action.  The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision.  Pp.412.
(a)Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, this Courts interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as Price Waterhouse and Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 9495.  This Court has never applied Title VIIs burden-shifting framework to ADEA claims and declines to do so now.  When conducting statutory interpretation, the Court must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.  Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike Title VII, which has been amended to explicitly authorize discrimination claims where an improper consideration was a motivating factor for the adverse action, see 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(m) and 2000e5(g)(2)(B), the ADEA does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor.  Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it added 2000e2(m) and 2000e5(g)(2)(B) to Title VII, even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways.  When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256, and negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest where the provisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted, Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330.  Pp.56.


(b)The ADEAs text does not authorize an alleged mixed-motives age discrimination claim.  The ordinary meaning of the ADEAs requirement that an employer took adverse action because of age is that age was the reason that the employer decided to act.  See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610.  To establish a disparate-treatment claim under this plain language, a plaintiff must prove that age was the but-for cause of the employers adverse decision.  See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___.  It follows that under 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that but-for cause.  This Court has previously held this to be the burdens proper allocation in ADEA cases, see, e.g., Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ______, ______, and nothing in the statutes text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception for a subset of ADEA cases.  Where a statute is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion, the ordinary default rule [is] that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56.  Hence, the burden of persuasion is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action.  Pp.79.


(c)This Court rejects petitioners contention that the proper interpretation of the ADEA is nonetheless controlled by Price Waterhouse, which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.  It is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance.  Whatever Price Waterhouses deficiencies in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply.  The problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims.  Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47.  Pp.1011.

08-67|"YEAGER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 0867.Argued March 23, 2009Decided June 18, 2009
A federal indictment charged petitioner Yeager with securities and wire fraud for allegedly misleading the public about the virtues of a fiber-optic telecommunications system offered by his employer, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., and with insider trading for selling his Enron stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the new systems performance and value to Enron.  The indictment also charged petitioner with money laundering for conducting various transactions with the proceeds of his stock sales.  The jury acquitted Yeager on the fraud counts but failed to reach a verdict on the insider-trading and money-laundering counts.  After the Government recharged him with some of the insider-trading and money-laundering counts, Yeager moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the jury, by acquitting him on the fraud counts, had necessarily decided that he did not possess material, nonpublic information about the projects performance and value, and that the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause therefore barred a second trial for insider trading and money laundering.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the fact that the jury hung on the insider-trading and money-laundering countsas opposed to acquitting petitionercast doubt on whether it had necessarily decided that petitioner did not possess material, nonpublic information.  This inconsistency between the acquittals and the hung counts, the Fifth Circuit concluded, meant that the Government could prosecute petitioner anew for insider trading and money laundering. 
Held:An apparent inconsistency between a jurys verdict of acquittal on some counts and its failure to return a verdict on other counts does not affect the acquittals preclusive force under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.615.
(a)This case is controlled by the reasoning in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, where the Court squarely held that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the Government from relitigating any issue that was necessarily decided by a jurys acquittal in a prior trial.  For double jeopardy purposes, the jurys inability to reach a verdict on Yeagers insider-trading and money-laundering counts was a nonevent that should be given no weight in the issue-preclusion analysis.  To identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial, courts should scrutinize the jurys decisions, not its failures to decide.  A jurys verdict of acquittal represents the communitys collective judgment regarding all the evidence and arguments presented to it.  Even if the verdict is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation, Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, its finality is unassailable, see, e.g., Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503.  Thus, if the possession of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges against Yeager, a jury verdict that necessarily decided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any charge for which that is an essential element.  Pp.612.


(b)Neither Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, nor United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, supports the Governments argument that it can retry Yeager for insider trading or money laundering.  Richardsons conclusion that a jurys failure  to reach a verdict is not an event which terminates jeopardy, 468 U. S., at 325, did not open the door to using a hung count to ignore the preclusive effect of a jurys acquittal, but was simply a rejection of the argumentsimilar to the Governments todaythat a mistrial is an event of significance.  Also rejected is the contention that an acquittal can never preclude retrial on a hung count because it would impute irrationality to the jury in violation of Powells rule that issue preclusion is predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally, 469 U. S., at 68.  The Courts refusal in Powell and in Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, to impugn the legitimacy of jury verdicts that, on their face, were logically inconsistent shows, a fortiori, that a potentially inconsistent hung count could not command a different result.  Pp.1214.


(c)The Government has argued that, even if hung counts cannot enter the issue-preclusion analysis, Yeager has failed to show that the jurys acquittals necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ultimate fact that must be proved to convict him of insider trading and money laundering.  Having granted certiorari on the assumption that the Fifth Circuit ruled correctly that the acquittals meant the jury found that Yeager did not have insider information that contradicted what was presented to the public, this Court declines to engage in a fact-intensive analysis of the voluminous record that is unnecessary to resolve the narrow legal question at issue.

			"|"YEAGER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 0867.Argued March 23, 2009Decided June 18, 2009
A federal indictment charged petitioner Yeager with securities and wire fraud for allegedly misleading the public about the virtues of a fiber-optic telecommunications system offered by his employer, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., and with insider trading for selling his Enron stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the new systems performance and value to Enron.  The indictment also charged petitioner with money laundering for conducting various transactions with the proceeds of his stock sales.  The jury acquitted Yeager on the fraud counts but failed to reach a verdict on the insider-trading and money-laundering counts.  After the Government recharged him with some of the insider-trading and money-laundering counts, Yeager moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the jury, by acquitting him on the fraud counts, had necessarily decided that he did not possess material, nonpublic information about the projects performance and value, and that the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause therefore barred a second trial for insider trading and money laundering.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the fact that the jury hung on the insider-trading and money-laundering countsas opposed to acquitting petitionercast doubt on whether it had necessarily decided that petitioner did not possess material, nonpublic information.  This inconsistency between the acquittals and the hung counts, the Fifth Circuit concluded, meant that the Government could prosecute petitioner anew for insider trading and money laundering. 
Held:An apparent inconsistency between a jurys verdict of acquittal on some counts and its failure to return a verdict on other counts does not affect the acquittals preclusive force under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.615.
(a)This case is controlled by the reasoning in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, where the Court squarely held that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the Government from relitigating any issue that was necessarily decided by a jurys acquittal in a prior trial.  For double jeopardy purposes, the jurys inability to reach a verdict on Yeagers insider-trading and money-laundering counts was a nonevent that should be given no weight in the issue-preclusion analysis.  To identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial, courts should scrutinize the jurys decisions, not its failures to decide.  A jurys verdict of acquittal represents the communitys collective judgment regarding all the evidence and arguments presented to it.  Even if the verdict is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation, Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, its finality is unassailable, see, e.g., Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503.  Thus, if the possession of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges against Yeager, a jury verdict that necessarily decided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any charge for which that is an essential element.  Pp.612.


(b)Neither Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, nor United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, supports the Governments argument that it can retry Yeager for insider trading or money laundering.  Richardsons conclusion that a jurys failure  to reach a verdict is not an event which terminates jeopardy, 468 U. S., at 325, did not open the door to using a hung count to ignore the preclusive effect of a jurys acquittal, but was simply a rejection of the argumentsimilar to the Governments todaythat a mistrial is an event of significance.  Also rejected is the contention that an acquittal can never preclude retrial on a hung count because it would impute irrationality to the jury in violation of Powells rule that issue preclusion is predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally, 469 U. S., at 68.  The Courts refusal in Powell and in Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, to impugn the legitimacy of jury verdicts that, on their face, were logically inconsistent shows, a fortiori, that a potentially inconsistent hung count could not command a different result.  Pp.1214.


(c)The Government has argued that, even if hung counts cannot enter the issue-preclusion analysis, Yeager has failed to show that the jurys acquittals necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ultimate fact that must be proved to convict him of insider trading and money laundering.  Having granted certiorari on the assumption that the Fifth Circuit ruled correctly that the acquittals meant the jury found that Yeager did not have insider information that contradicted what was presented to the public, this Court declines to engage in a fact-intensive analysis of the voluminous record that is unnecessary to resolve the narrow legal question at issue.  If the Court of Appeals chooses, it may revisit its factual analysis in light of the Governments arguments before this Court.  Pp.1415.

08-310|"POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ, ALASKA
certiorari to the supreme court of alaska
No. 08310.Argued April 1, 2009Decided June 15, 2009
A Valdez, Alaska, ordinance that imposes a personal property tax on certain boats and vessels contains exceptions which, in effect, largely limit its applicability to large oil tankers.  Petitioner Polar Tankers, Inc., whose vessels transport crude oil from the Port of Valdez to refineries in other States, challenged the ordinance in state court, claiming (1) that the tax was unconstitutional under Art. I, 10, cl. 3, which forbids a State  without the Consent of Congress, [to] lay any Duty of Tonnage, and (2) that the taxs value-allocation method violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses.  The court rejected the Tonnage Clause claim, but accepted the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim.  On appeal, the State Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding that because it was a value-based property tax, the tax was not a duty of tonnage.  The State Supreme Court also held the allocation method was fair and thus valid under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
182 P.3d 614, reversed and remanded.
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, and IIB1, concluding that Valdezs tax violates the Tonnage Clause.  Consequently, Polar Tankers alternative Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause arguments need not be considered.  Pp.38.


(a)This Court has consistently interpreted the language of the Tonnage Clause in light of its purpose, which mirrors the intent of other constitutional provisions that seek to restrain the States from exercising the taxing power in a way that is injurious to the interests of other States.  The Clause seeks to prevent States from nullifying Art. I, 10, cl. 2s prohibition against import and export duties by taxing the vessels transporting the merchandise.  Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Commn, 296 U. S. 261, 265.  It also reflects an effort to diminish a States ability to obtain tax advantages based on its favorable geographic position.  Because the Clause forbids a State to do that indirectly which she is forbidden  to do directly,  Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 458, the prohibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port, Clyde Mallory Lines, supra, at 265266.  Pp.36. 


(b)This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause forbids.  The ordinance seems designed to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port.  The tax applies almost exclusively to oil tankers, but to no other form of personal property.  An oil tanker can be subject to the tax based on a single entry into the port.  Moreover, the tax is closely correlated with cargo capacity.  Contrary to Valdezs argument, the fact that the tax is designed to raise revenue for general municipal services argues for, not against, application of the Clause.  Pp.68.


Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Ginsburg, rejected, in Part IIB2, Valdezs claim that, under State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, its tax is not within the prohibition of the Constitution, because it is levied  upon ships  as property, based on a valuation of the same as property, id., at 213 (emphasis deleted).  This Court later made clear that the prohibition against tonnage duties comes into play where vessels are not taxed in the same manner as the other property of the citizens, Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273, 284.  This qualification, important in light of the Clauses purpose, means that, in order to fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon other businesses.  Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement.  The Court can find little, if any, other personal property that Valdez taxes.  Because its value-related property tax on mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles applies only if they are affixed to a particular site, it taxes those vehicles as a form of real, not personal, property.  Valdez also claims that its ship tax is simply another form of a value-based tax on oil-related property provided by state law.  But Valdezs tax, a purely a municipal tax, differs from the tax on other oil-related property, which is primarily a state-level tax, in several ways.  As a result of these differences, an ordinary oil-related business finding the tax on its movable property too burdensome must complain to the State, which is in charge of setting the manner of assessment and valuation.  At the same time, an oil tanker finding its vessel tax too burdensome must complain to Valdez, for the State has nothing to do with that taxs rate, valuation, or assessment.  There is also no effective electorate-related check on Valdezs vessel-taxing power comparable to the check available when a property tax is more broadly imposed.  Valdezs property tax hits only ships; it is not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business property alike.  Thus, Valdezs tax lacks the safeguards implied by this Courts statements that a property tax on ships escapes the Tonnage Clauses scope only when that tax is imposed upon ships in the same manner as it is imposed on other forms of property.  Pp.813.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that Valdezs tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the citys argument that its tax may be sustained as a property tax similar to ones the city imposes on other property should be rejected because an unconstitutional tax on maritime commerce does not become permissible when bundled with taxes on other activities or property.  Pp.13.


Justice Alito agreed that Valdezs tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the tax is an unconstitutional duty of tonnage even if the Tonnage Clause permits a true, evenhanded property tax to be applied to vessels.  P.1.
Breyer, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, and IIB1, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part IIB2, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.

08-495|"NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 08495.Argued April 27, 2009Decided June 15, 2009
An alien convicted of an aggravated felony any time after admission is deportable.  8 U. S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  An aggravated felony includes an offense that  involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the  victims exceeds $10,000.  1101(a)(43)(M)(i).  Petitioner, an alien, was convicted of conspiring to commit mail fraud and related crimes.  Because the relevant statutes did not require a finding of loss, the jury made no such finding.  However, at sentencing, petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million.  He was sentenced to prison and required to make $683 million in restitution.  The Government subsequently sought to remove him from the United States, claiming that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  The Immigration Judge found that petitioners conviction fell within the aggravated felony definition.  The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed, as did the Third Circuit, which held that the Immigration Judge could inquire into the underlying facts of a prior fraud conviction for purposes of determining whether the loss to the victims exceeded $10,000.    
Held:Subparagraph (M)(i)s $10,000 threshold refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion rather than to an element of the fraud or deceit crime.  Pp.313. 
(a)Words such as crime, felony, and offense sometimes refer to a generic crime (a categorical interpretation), and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged (circumstance-specific interpretation).  The basic argument favoring the categorical interpretation rests upon Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, and James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192.  These cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which enhances the sentence for firearm-law offenders who have prior violent felony convictions, 18 U. S.C. 924(e).  The Court held that the word felony refers to a generic crime as generally committed.  Thus, for example, in James, the Court applied the categorical method to determine whether an attempted burglary was a violent felony.  That method required the Court to examine not the unsuccessful burglary  attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.  550 U. S.em>., at 204206.  Pp.35.


(b)Contrary to petitioners arguments, the $10,000 loss provision at issue calls for a circumstance-specific interpretation, not a categorical one.  The aggravated felony statute of which it is a part differs from ACCA in general, and the $10,000 loss provision differs specifically from ACCAs provisions.  Pp.610.


(1) The aggravated felony statute at issue resembles ACCA when it lists several offenses in language that must refer to generic crimes.  But other offenses are listed using language that almost certainly refers to specific circumstances.  Title 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43)(P), for example, after referring to an offense that amounts to falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport, adds, except in the case of a first offense for which  the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting  the aliens spouse, child, or parent  to violate a provision of this chapter.  The language about forging  passport[s] may well refer to a generic crime, but the exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime, because there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception.  Subparagraph (M)(ii), which refers to an offense described in [26 U. S.C. 7201] (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds $10,000, provides another example.  Because no 7201 offense has a specific loss amount as an element, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless, unless the revenue loss language calls for circumstance-specific application.  Here, the question is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.  Pp.68.


(2)Subparagraph (M)(i)s language is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.  The words in which (modifying offense) can refer to the conduct involved in the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.  Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the tax-evasion provision, and their structures are identical.  Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations.  IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34.  Additionally, applying a categorical approach would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application.  Only three federal fraud statutes appear to contain a relevant monetary loss threshold.  And at the time the $10,000 threshold was added, only eight States had fraud and deceit statutes in respect to which that threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect.  Congress is unlikely to have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply in such a limited and haphazard manner.  Pp.810.


(c)This Court rejects petitioners alternative position that fairness calls for a modified categorical approach requiring a jury verdict or a judge-approved equivalent to embody a loss-amount determination, and permitting the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) to examine only charging documents, jury instructions, and any special jury finding, or their equivalents.  The Courts cases developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points for a very different purpose, namely, to determine which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision covering several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction.  Additionally, petitioners proposal can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that is not an element of the offense.  Further, evidence of loss offered by the Government must meet a clear and convincing standard and the loss must be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.  These considerations mean that petitioner and others in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the loss amount, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing.  There was nothing unfair about the Immigration Judges reliance on earlier sentencing-related material here.  The defendants sentencing stipulation and the courts restitution order show that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than $10,000.  Absent any conflicting evidence, this evidence is clear and convincing.  Pp.1012.
523 F.3d 387, affirmed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 071090.Argued April 20, 2009Decided June 8, 2009
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) prohibits suits against other countries in American courts, 28 U. S.C. 1604, with certain exceptions.  One exception, 1605(a)(7) (now repealed), stripped a foreign state of immunity in any suit arising from certain acts of terrorism that occurred when the state was designated as a sponsor of terrorism under 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  


Iraq was designated as a sponsor of terrorism in 1990, but in 2003, following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress enacted the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA), 1503 of which included a proviso clause (the second in a series of eight) authorizing the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq []620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.  Although President Bush exercised that authority, the D.C. Circuit held in its 2004 Acree decision that the EWSAA did not permit the President to waive 1605(a)(7), and thereby restore Iraqs sovereign immunity, for claims arising from actions Iraq took while designated as a sponsor of terrorism.


Thereafter, Congress repealed 1605(a)(7) in 1083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA) and replaced it with a new, roughly similar exception, 1083(a).  The NDAA also declared that nothing in EWSAA ever authorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of [the FSIA] or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court (thus purporting to ratify Acree), 1083(c)(4); and authorized the President to waive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq under certain conditions, 1083(d).  On the same day the President signed the NDAA into law he also waived all of 1083s provisions as to Iraq.


Respondents filed these suits against Iraq in early 2003, alleging mistreatment by Iraqi officials during and after the 1991 Gulf War.  Under Acree, the courts below refused to dismiss either case on jurisdictional grounds.  The D.C. Circuit also rejected Iraqs alternative argument that even if 1605(a)(7)s application to it survived the Presidents EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by NDAA 1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); and that the President had waived NDAA 1083(a)s new exception with respect to Iraq under his 1083(d) authority.  The court held instead that it retained jurisdiction over cases pending against Iraq when the NDAA was enacted.  
Held:Iraq is no longer subject to suit in federal court.  Pp.617.
(a)The District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his EWSAA authority to make 1605(a)(7) inapplicable with respect to Iraq.  Pp.613.


(i)Iraqs (and the United States) reading of EWSAA 1503s second proviso as sweeping in 1605(a)(7)s terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity is straightforward.  In the provisos terms, the exception is a provision of law (indisputably) that applies to (strips immunity from) countries that have supported terrorism (as designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions).  Because he exercised his waiver authority with respect to all provisions of law encompassed by the second proviso, his actions made 1605(a)(7) inapplicable to Iraq.  Pp.67. 


(ii)Acrees resistance to the above construction was based on a sophisticated attempt to construe EWSAA 1503s second proviso as limiting that sections principal clause, which authorized suspension of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990.  While a provisos general office  is to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify and restrain its generality, United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534, another recognized use is to introduce independent legislation, id., at 535, which was the function of the proviso here.  In any event, 1605(a)(7) falls within the scope of the proviso even accepting the narrower interpretation adopted by the Acree decision.  Pp.711. 


(iii)Respondents other objections to the straightforward interpretation of EWSAA 1503s proviso are rejected.  Pp.1112. 


(iv)Nothing in the NDAA changes the above analysis.  Although NDAA 1083(c)(4) appears to ratify Acree, this Court need not decide whether such a ratification is effective because 1083(d)(1) authorized the President to waive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq, and he waived all such provisions, including 1083(c)(4).  Pp.1213. 


(b)The Court rejects the argument that 1605(a)(7)s inapplicability does not bar claims arising from Iraqs conduct prior to the Presidents waiver.  In order to exercise jurisdiction over these cases, the District Court had to apply 1605(a)(7) with respect to Iraq, but the Presidents waiver made that provision inapplicable.  No retroactivity problem is posed by this construction, if only because the primary conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred before 1605(a)(7)s enactment.  Pp.1316. 


(c)Respondents also argue that EWSAA 1503s sunset clauseunder which the authorities contained in [that] section expired in 2005revived 1605(a)(7) and restored jurisdiction as of the sunset date.  But expiration of the 1503 authorities is not the same as cancellation of the effect of the prior valid exercise of those authorities.  Pp.1617.

07-1309|"BOYLE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 071309.Argued January 14, 2009Decided June 8, 2009
The evidence at petitioner Boyles trial for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision forbidding any person  associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprises affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U. S.C. 1962(c), was sufficient to prove, among other things, that Boyle and others committed a series of bank thefts in several States; that the participants included a core group, along with others recruited from time to time; and that the core group was loosely and informally organized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master plan.  Relying largely on United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 583, the District Court instructed the jury that to establish a RICO association-in-fact enterprise, the Government must prove (1) an ongoing organization with a framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives, and (2) that association members functioned as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.  The court also told the jury that an association-in-facts existence is often more readily proved by what it does than by abstract analysis of its structure, and denied Boyles request for an instruction requiring the Government to prove that the enterprise had an ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.  Boyle was convicted, and the Second Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a structure, but the pertinent jury instruction need not be framed in the precise language Boyle proposes, i.e., as having an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.  Pp.412.


(a)In light of RICOs broad statement that an enterprise includes any  group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, 1961(4), and the requirement that RICO be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes, note following 1961, Turkette explained that enterprise reaches a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, 452 U. S., at 583, and is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.  Ibid.  Pp.45. 


(b)The question presented by this case is whether an association-in-fact enterprise must have an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.  Pet. for Cert. i.  This question can be broken into three parts.  First, the enterprise must have a structure that, under RICOs terms, has at least three features:a purpose, relationships among the associates, and longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprises purpose.  See Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583.  The instructions need not actually use the term structure, however, so long as the relevant points substance is adequately expressed.  Second, because a jury must find the existence of elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, requiring a jury to find the existence of a structure that is ascertainable would be redundant and potentially misleading.  Third, the phrase beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity is correctly interpreted to mean that the enterprises existence is a separate element that must be proved, not that such existence may never be inferred from the evidence showing that the associates engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.  See ibid.  Pp.68. 


(c)Boyles argument that an enterprise must have structural features additional to those that can be fairly inferred from RICOs languagee.g., a hierarchical structure or chain of command; fixed roles for associates; and an enterprise name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonieshas no basis in the statutes text.  As Turkette said, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.  The breadth of RICOs enterprise concept is highlighted by comparing the statute with other federal laws having much more stringent requirements for targeting organized criminal groups: E.g., 1955(b) defines an illegal gambling business as one that involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.  Pp.810. 


(d)Rejection of Boyles argument does not lead to a merger of the 1962(c) crime and other federal offenses.  For example, proof that a defendant violated 1955 does not necessarily establish that he conspired to participate in a gambling enterprises affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  Rather, that would require the prosecution to prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of 1955 violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes.  See 1961(1).  Pp.1011.  


(e)Because RICOs language is clear, the Court need not reach Boyles statutory purpose, legislative history, or rule-of-lenity arguments.  Pp.1112.  


2.The instructions below were correct and adequate.  By explicitly telling jurors they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise, the instructions made clear that this was a separate element from the pattern of racketeering activity.  The jurors also were adequately told that the enterprise needed the structural attributes that may be inferred from the statutory language.  Finally, the instruction that an enterprises existence is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure properly conveyed Turkettes point that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit an inference of the enterprises existence.  P.12.

08-22|"CAPERTON etal. v. A. T. MASSEY COAL CO., INC., etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia
No. 0822.Argued March 3, 2009Decided June 8, 2009
After a West Virginia jury found respondents, a coal company and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey), liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations and awarded petitioners (hereinafter Caperton) $50 million in damages, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections.  Knowing the State Supreme Court of Appeals would consider the appeal, Don Blankenship, Masseys chairman and principal officer, supported Brent Benjamin rather than the incumbent justice seeking reelection.  His $3 million in contributions exceeded the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and by Benjamins own committee.  Benjamin won by fewer than 50,000 votes.  Before Massey filed its appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the States Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenships campaign involvement.  Justice Benjamin denied the motion, indicating that he found nothing showing bias for or against any litigant.  The court then reversed the $50 million verdict.  During the rehearing process, Justice Benjamin refused twice more to recuse himself, and the court once again reversed the jury verdict.  Four months later, Justice Benjamin filed a concurring opinion, defending the courts opinion and his recusal decision.  
Held:In all the circumstances of this case, due process requires recusal.  Pp.620.
(a)The Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule requiring recusal when a judge has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in a case, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523, but this Court has also identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal where the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable, Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 47.  Two such instances place the present case in proper context.  Pp.611.


(1)The first involved local tribunals in which a judge had a financial interest in a cases outcome that was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.  In Tumey, a village mayor with authority to try those accused of violating a law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages faced two potential conflicts: Because he received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties that was funded from the fines assessed, he received a supplement only upon a conviction; and sums from the fines were deposited to the villages general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.  Disqualification was required under the principle that [e]very procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.  273 U. S.em>., at 532.  In Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57, a conviction in another mayors court was invalidated even though the fines assessed went only to the towns general fisc, because the mayor faced a possible temptation created by his executive responsibilities for village finances.  Id., at 60.  Recusal was also required where an Alabama Supreme Court justice cast the deciding vote upholding a punitive damages award while he was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical suit pending in Alabamas lower courts.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813.  The proper constitutional inquiry was not whether in fact [the justice] was influenced, id., at 825, but whether sitting on [that] case  would offer a possible temptation to the average  judge to  lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true, ibid.  While the degree or kind of interest  sufficient to disqualify a judge  [could not] be defined with precision,  id., at 822, the test did have an objective component.  Pp.79.


(2)The second instance emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but had determined in an earlier proceeding whether criminal charges should be brought and then proceeded to try and convict the petitioners.  In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133.  Finding that no man can be a judge in his own case, and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome, id., at 136, the Court noted that the circumstances of the case and the prior relationship required recusal.  The judges prior relationship with the defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior proceeding, was critical.  In reiterating that the rule that a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be [tried] before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor, Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U. S. 455, 466, rests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant, id., at 465, the Court noted that the objective inquiry is not whether the judge is actually biased, but whether the average judge in his position is likely to be neutral or there is an unconstitutional potential for bias, id., at 466.  Pp.911.


(b)Because the objective standards implementing the Due Process Clause do not require proof of actual bias, this Court does not question Justice Benjamins subjective findings of impartiality and propriety and need not determine whether there was actual bias.  Rather, the question is whether, under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness, the interest poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.  Withrow, 421 U. S., at 47.  There is a serious risk of actual bias when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judges election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.  The proper inquiry centers on the contributions relative size in comparison to the total amount contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect of the contribution on the outcome.  It is not whether the contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamins victory.  In an election decided by fewer than 50,000 votes, Blankenships campaign contributionscompared to the total amount contributed to the campaign, as well as the total amount spent in the electionhad a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome.  And the risk that Blankenships influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial that it must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.  Ibid.  The temporal relationship between the campaign contributions, the justices election, and the pendency of the case is also critical, for it was reasonably foreseeable that the pending case would be before the newly elected justice.  There is no allegation of a quid pro quo agreement, but the extraordinary contributions were made at a time when Blankenship had a vested stake in the outcome.  Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise whenwithout the other parties consenta man chooses the judge in his own cause.  Applying this principle to the judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benjamins recusal.  Pp.1116.

			"|"CAPERTON etal. v. A. T. MASSEY COAL CO., INC., etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia
No. 0822.Argued March 3, 2009Decided June 8, 2009
After a West Virginia jury found respondents, a coal company and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey), liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations and awarded petitioners (hereinafter Caperton) $50 million in damages, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections.  Knowing the State Supreme Court of Appeals would consider the appeal, Don Blankenship, Masseys chairman and principal officer, supported Brent Benjamin rather than the incumbent justice seeking reelection.  His $3 million in contributions exceeded the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and by Benjamins own committee.  Benjamin won by fewer than 50,000 votes.  Before Massey filed its appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the States Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenships campaign involvement.  Justice Benjamin denied the motion, indicating that he found nothing showing bias for or against any litigant.  The court then reversed the $50 million verdict.  During the rehearing process, Justice Benjamin refused twice more to recuse himself, and the court once again reversed the jury verdict.  Four months later, Justice Benjamin filed a concurring opinion, defending the courts opinion and his recusal decision.  
Held:In all the circumstances of this case, due process requires recusal.  Pp.620.
(a)The Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule requiring recusal when a judge has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in a case, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523, but this Court has also identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal where the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable, Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 47.  Two such instances place the present case in proper context.  Pp.611.


(1)The first involved local tribunals in which a judge had a financial interest in a cases outcome that was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.  In Tumey, a village mayor with authority to try those accused of violating a law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages faced two potential conflicts: Because he received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties that was funded from the fines assessed, he received a supplement only upon a conviction; and sums from the fines were deposited to the villages general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.  Disqualification was required under the principle that [e]very procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.  273 U. S.em>., at 532.  In Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57, a conviction in another mayors court was invalidated even though the fines assessed went only to the towns general fisc, because the mayor faced a possible temptation created by his executive responsibilities for village finances.  Id., at 60.  Recusal was also required where an Alabama Supreme Court justice cast the deciding vote upholding a punitive damages award while he was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical suit pending in Alabamas lower courts.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813.  The proper constitutional inquiry was not whether in fact [the justice] was influenced, id., at 825, but whether sitting on [that] case  would offer a possible temptation to the average  judge to  lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true, ibid.  While the degree or kind of interest  sufficient to disqualify a judge  [could not] be defined with precision,  id., at 822, the test did have an objective component.  Pp.79.


(2)The second instance emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but had determined in an earlier proceeding whether criminal charges should be brought and then proceeded to try and convict the petitioners.  In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133.  Finding that no man can be a judge in his own case, and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome, id., at 136, the Court noted that the circumstances of the case and the prior relationship required recusal.  The judges prior relationship with the defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior proceeding, was critical.  In reiterating that the rule that a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be [tried] before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor, Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U. S. 455, 466, rests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant, id., at 465, the Court noted that the objective inquiry is not whether the judge is actually biased, but whether the average judge in his position is likely to be neutral or there is an unconstitutional potential for bias, id., at 466.  Pp.911.


(b)Because the objective standards implementing the Due Process Clause do not require proof of actual bias, this Court does not question Justice Benjamins subjective findings of impartiality and propriety and need not determine whether there was actual bias.  Rather, the question is whether, under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness, the interest poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.  Withrow, 421 U. S., at 47.  There is a serious risk of actual bias when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judges election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.  The proper inquiry centers on the contributions relative size in comparison to the total amount contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect of the contribution on the outcome.  It is not whether the contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamins victory.  In an election decided by fewer than 50,000 votes, Blankenships campaign contributionscompared to the total amount contributed to the campaign, as well as the total amount spent in the electionhad a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome.  And the risk that Blankenships influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial that it must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.  Ibid.  The temporal relationship between the campaign contributions, the justices election, and the pendency of the case is also critical, for it was reasonably foreseeable that the pending case would be before the newly elected justice.  There is no allegation of a quid pro quo agreement, but the extraordinary contributions were made at a time when Blankenship had a vested stake in the outcome.  Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise whenwithout the other parties consenta man chooses the judge in his own cause.  Applying this principle to the judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benjamins recusal.  Pp.1116.


(c)Massey and its amici err in predicting that this decision will lead to adverse consequences ranging from a flood of recusal motions to unnecessary interference with judicial elections.  They point to no other instance involving judicial campaign contributions that presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this case, which are extreme by any measure.  And because the States may have codes of conduct with more rigorous recusal standards than due process requires, most recusal disputes will be resolved without resort to the Constitution, making the constitutional standards application rare.

08-267|"UNITED STATES v. DENEDO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces
No. 08267.Argued March 25, 2009Decided June 8, 2009
Military authorities charged respondent, a native Nigerian serving in the U. S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  With counsels assistance, respondent agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges.  The special court-martial accepted the plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was discharged from the Navy in 2000.  In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent based on the conviction.  To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a writ of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of deportation.  Though rejecting the Governments contention that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for lack of merit.  Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further proceedings on the merits.  
Held: 
1.This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U. S.C. 1259(4), which permits it to review CAAF decisions in cases in which [that court] granted relief.  Respondents parsimonious view that the CAAF did not gran[t] relief in this case, but simply remanded to the NMCCA, is rejected.  Though 1259 does not define relief, the words familiar meaning encompasses any redress or benefit provided by a court.  The CAAFs judgment reversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition.  Pp.45.  


2.Article I military courts have jurisdiction to entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect.  Pp.513.  


(a)Military courts power to issue extraordinary writs under the All Writs Act, see Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S. 683, 695, n.7, does not determine the anterior question whether those courts have jurisdiction to entertain a coram nobis petition.  As recognized by the All Writs Actwhich permits courts established by Act of Congress to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions, 28 U. S.C. 1651(a)a courts power to issue any form of relief, extraordinary or otherwise, is contingent on its subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or controversy.  Such jurisdiction is determined by Congress.  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212.  Thus, to issue respondent a writ of coram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had statutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondents original judgment of conviction.  Pp.58.   


(b)Pursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA and the CAAF have subject-matter jurisdiction over this case.  The NMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondents coram nobis request under UCMJ Article 66, which provides: For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases, the [NMCCA] may sit .  10 U. S.C. 866(a).  Because respondents coram nobis request is simply a further step in [his] criminal appeal, United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 505 n.4, the NMCCAs jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised under 866(a) to hear and determine the convictions validity on direct review.  Respondents coram nobis request is not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority.  866(c).  An alleged error in the original judgment predicated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the convictions validity, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at ___, so respondents Sixth Amendment claim is with respect to the special-court-martials findings of guilty.  Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCAs denial of respondents petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.  That the CAAFs authority is confined to matters of law connected to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeals, 867(c), poses no obstacle to respondents requested review.  His Sixth Amendment claim presents a matte[r] of law with respect to the [guilty] findings  as approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed  by the NMCCA.  Pp.810. 


(c)The Governments argument that UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively prohibits the type of collateral review respondent seeks errs in conflating the jurisdictional question with the merits of respondents petition, Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, ante, at ___.  Article 76 provides for the finality of judgments in military cases.  Just as the finality principle did not jurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan, supra, from examining its earlier judgment, neither does it bar the NMCCA from doing so here.  The Governments contention that coram nobis permits a court to correct its own errors, not those of an inferior court, is disposed of on similar grounds.  Pp.1012.

Petitioner filed this qui tam action in the name of the United States against respondent city and several of its officials under the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S.C. 3729.  The Government declined to exercise its statutory right to intervene, the District Court dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for respondents, and petitioner filed a notice of appeal 54 days later.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) and 28 U. S.C. 2107(a) require, generally, that such a notice be filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, but Rule 4(a)(1)(B) and 2107(b) extend the period to 60 days when the United States is a party.  The Second Circuit held that the 30-day limit applied and dismissed petitioners appeal as untimely.  
Held:When the United States has declined to intervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a party to the litigation for purposes of either 2107 or Rule 4.  Because petitioners time for filing a notice of appeal in this case was therefore 30 days, his appeal was untimely.  Pp.39.
(a)Although the United States is aware of and minimally involved in every FCA action, it is not a party thereto unless it has brought the action or exercised its statutory right to intervene in the case.  Indeed, intervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party.  See Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301, 304.  To hold otherwise would render the FCAs intervention provisions superfluous, contradicting the requirement that statutes be construed in a manner that gives effect to all their provisions, see, e.g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166.  The FCA expressly gave the United States discretion to intervene in FCA actions, and the Court cannot disregard that congressional assignment of discretion by designating the United States a party even after it has declined to assume the rights and burdens attendant to full party status.  Pp.36. 


(b)Petitioners arguments for designating the United States a party in all FCA actions are unconvincing.  First, neither the United States real party in interest status, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.17(a), nor the requirement that an FCA action be brought in the name of the Government, 31 U. S.C. 3730(b)(1), converts the United States into a party where, as here, it has declined to bring the action or intervene.  Second, the Governments right to receive pleadings and deposition transcripts when it declines to intervene, see 3730(c)(3), does not support, but weighs against, petitioners argument: If the United States were a party to every FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such materials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure5.  Third, the fact that the United States is bound by the judgment in all FCA actions regardless of its participation in the case is not a legitimate basis for disregarding the statutes intervention scheme.  Finally, given that Rule 4(a)(1)(B) hinges its 60-day time limit on the United States party status, petitioners contention that the limits underlying purpose would be best served by applying it in every FCA case is unavailing.

08-1034|"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. THURSTON
HENSLEY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of
appeals of tennessee, eastern division
No. 081034.Decided June 1, 2009
Per Curiam.

The Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, provides that employees of common-carrier railroads may recover for work-related injuries caused in whole or in part by their railroad-employers negligence.  See 45 U. S.C. 5160.  In this case respondent Thurston Hensley sued petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., in Tennessee state court.  Hensley, who was employed by CSX as an electrician, alleged that the railroad negligently caused him to contract asbestosisa noncancerous scarring of lung tissue caused by long-term exposure to asbestos.


Hensley sought pain-and-suffering damages from CSX based on, among other things, his fear of developing lung cancer in the future.  The Court addressed this subject in Norfolk & Western R.Co. v. Ayers, 538 U. S. 135 (2003), and held that those types of damages are available in certain FELA cases.  The Court stated:
Norfolk presented the question whether a plaintiff who has asbestosis but not cancer can recover damages for fear of cancer under the FELA without proof of physical manifestations of the claimed emotional distress.  Our answer is yes, with an important reservation.  We affirm only the qualification of an asbestosis sufferer to seek compensation for fear of cancer as an element of his asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages.  It is incumbent upon such a complainant, however, to prove that his alleged fear is genuine and serious.  Id., at 157 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).

At the close of a 3-week trial, Hensley and CSX submitted proposed jury instructions to the trial court.  CSX proposed two instructionsrequests 30 and 33related to Hensleys claim for fear-of-cancer damages.  Request 30 stated the basic requirements to obtain those damages under Ayers.  Supp. Tech. Record, Exh. A, p. 4 (Plaintiff is also alleging that he suffers from a compensable fear of cancer.  In order to recover, Plaintiff must demonstrate  that the  fear is genuine and serious).  Request 33 stated certain factors the jury could consider in applying the Ayers standard.  Id., at 56.  The trial court denied both requests over CSXs objections, and the jury was not instructed as to the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages.  17 Tr. 24102415; 20 id., at 29032904.  After two hours of deliberations, the jury found for Hensley and awarded him $5 million in damages.


The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed.  278 S.W. 3d 282 (2008).  It described our opinion in Ayers as specifically limit[ed] to the narrow issue of whether a FELA plaintiff with asbestosis can recover for fear of cancer.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300.  According to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, Ayers did not discuss or authorize jury instructions on this issue, but merely ruled on substantive law.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Tennessee Court of Appeals also reasoned that little if any purpose would be served by instructing the jury that the plaintiffs fear must be genuine and serious.  Ibid.  That is because the mere suggestion of the possibility of cancer has the potential to evoke raw emotions, and [a]ny juror who might be predisposed to grant a large award based on shaky evidence of a fear of cancer is unlikely to be swayed by the language of Ayers.  Ibid.  Instead, the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, it is for the courts to serve as gatekeepers by ensuring that fear-of-cancer claims do not go to the jury unless there is credible evidence of a genuine and serious fear.  Ibid.


CSX petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Tennessee Court of Appeals misread and misapplied this Courts decision in Ayers.  CSXs contention is correct.  The ruling of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the refusal of the trial court to give an instruction, were clear error.  Contrary to the assertion of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, the Ayers Court expressly recognized that several verdict control devices [are] available to the trial court when a FELA plaintiff seeks fear-of-cancer damages.  538 U. S., at 159, n.19.  Those include, on a defendants request, a charge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to be genuine and serious.  Ibid.  CSX requested an instruction on the substance of the genuine-and-serious standard, and the trial court erred by not giving one.


The reasons given by the Tennessee Court of Appeals for upholding the denial of an instruction on the standard do not withstand scrutiny.  The court stated that instructing the jury on the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages would have been futile because cancer touches many lives and therefore evoke[s] [jurors] raw emotions.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300.  This is a serious misunderstanding of the nature and function of the jury.  The jury system is premised on the idea that rationality and careful regard for the courts instructions will confine and exclude jurors raw emotions.  Jurors routinely serve as impartial factfinders in cases that involve sensitive, even life-and-death matters.  In those cases, as in all cases, juries are presumed to follow the courts instructions.  See Greer v. Miller, 483 U. S. 756, 766, n.8 (1987).  And the trial court in this case correctly instructed the jury as to its legal duty to follow all of the instructions.  20 Tr. 2882.


Instructing the jury on the standard for fear-of-cancer damages would not have been futile.  To the contrary, the fact that cancer claims could evoke raw emotions is a powerful reason to instruct the jury on the proper legal standard.  Giving the instruction on this point is particularly important in the FELA context.  That is because of the volume of pending asbestos claims and also because the nature of those claims enhances the danger that a jury, without proper instructions, could award emotional-distress damages based on slight evidence of a plaintiffs fear of contracting cancer.  But as this Court said in Ayers, more is required.  Although plaintiffs can seek fear-of-cancer damages in some FELA cases, they must satisfy a high standard in order to obtain them.  538 U. S., at 157158, and n.17.  Refusing defendants requests to instruct the jury as to that high standard would render it all but meaningless.


It is no answer that, as the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, courts can apply the Ayers standard when ruling on sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges.  To be sure, Ayers recognized that a review of the evidence on damages for sufficiency is another of the verdict control devices available to courts when plaintiffs seek fear-of-cancer damages.  Id., at 159, n.19.  But a determination that there is sufficient evidence to send a claim to a jury is not the same as a determination that a plaintiff has met the burden of proof and should succeed on a claim outright.  Put another way, a properly instructed jury could find that a plaintiffs fear is not genuine and serious even when there is legally sufficient evidence for the jury to rule for the plaintiff on the issue.  That is why Ayers recognized that sufficiency reviews and jury instructions are important and separate protections against imposing unbounded liability on asbestos defendants in fear-of-cancer claims.


When this Court in Ayers held that certain FELA plaintiffs can recover based on their fear of developing cancer, it struck a delicate balance between plaintiffs and defendantsand it did so against the backdrop of systemic difficulties posed by the elephantine mass of asbestos cases.  Id., at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Jury instructions stating the proper standard for fear-of-cancer damages were part of that balance, id., at 159, n.19, and courts must give such instructions upon a defendants request.  The ruling of the Tennessee Court of Appeals conflicts with Ayers.  The trial court should have given the substance of the requested instructions.  See also Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R.Co., 210 S.W. 3d 220, 227229 (Mo. App. 2006) (same).


The petition for certiorari is granted.  The motions for leave to file briefs amici curiae of American Tort Reform Association, etal.; Association of American Railroads; and Washington Legal Foundation are granted.  The judgment of the Tennessee Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

			"|"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. THURSTON
HENSLEY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of
appeals of tennessee, eastern division
No. 081034.Decided June 1, 2009
Per Curiam.

The Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, provides that employees of common-carrier railroads may recover for work-related injuries caused in whole or in part by their railroad-employers negligence.  See 45 U. S.C. 5160.  In this case respondent Thurston Hensley sued petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., in Tennessee state court.  Hensley, who was employed by CSX as an electrician, alleged that the railroad negligently caused him to contract asbestosisa noncancerous scarring of lung tissue caused by long-term exposure to asbestos.


Hensley sought pain-and-suffering damages from CSX based on, among other things, his fear of developing lung cancer in the future.  The Court addressed this subject in Norfolk & Western R.Co. v. Ayers, 538 U. S. 135 (2003), and held that those types of damages are available in certain FELA cases.  The Court stated:
Norfolk presented the question whether a plaintiff who has asbestosis but not cancer can recover damages for fear of cancer under the FELA without proof of physical manifestations of the claimed emotional distress.  Our answer is yes, with an important reservation.  We affirm only the qualification of an asbestosis sufferer to seek compensation for fear of cancer as an element of his asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages.  It is incumbent upon such a complainant, however, to prove that his alleged fear is genuine and serious.  Id., at 157 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).

At the close of a 3-week trial, Hensley and CSX submitted proposed jury instructions to the trial court.  CSX proposed two instructionsrequests 30 and 33related to Hensleys claim for fear-of-cancer damages.  Request 30 stated the basic requirements to obtain those damages under Ayers.  Supp. Tech. Record, Exh. A, p. 4 (Plaintiff is also alleging that he suffers from a compensable fear of cancer.  In order to recover, Plaintiff must demonstrate  that the  fear is genuine and serious).  Request 33 stated certain factors the jury could consider in applying the Ayers standard.  Id., at 56.  The trial court denied both requests over CSXs objections, and the jury was not instructed as to the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages.  17 Tr. 24102415; 20 id., at 29032904.  After two hours of deliberations, the jury found for Hensley and awarded him $5 million in damages.


The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed.  278 S.W. 3d 282 (2008).  It described our opinion in Ayers as specifically limit[ed] to the narrow issue of whether a FELA plaintiff with asbestosis can recover for fear of cancer.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300.  According to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, Ayers did not discuss or authorize jury instructions on this issue, but merely ruled on substantive law.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Tennessee Court of Appeals also reasoned that little if any purpose would be served by instructing the jury that the plaintiffs fear must be genuine and serious.  Ibid.  That is because the mere suggestion of the possibility of cancer has the potential to evoke raw emotions, and [a]ny juror who might be predisposed to grant a large award based on shaky evidence of a fear of cancer is unlikely to be swayed by the language of Ayers.  Ibid.  Instead, the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, it is for the courts to serve as gatekeepers by ensuring that fear-of-cancer claims do not go to the jury unless there is credible evidence of a genuine and serious fear.  Ibid.


CSX petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Tennessee Court of Appeals misread and misapplied this Courts decision in Ayers.  CSXs contention is correct.  The ruling of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the refusal of the trial court to give an instruction, were clear error.  Contrary to the assertion of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, the Ayers Court expressly recognized that several verdict control devices [are] available to the trial court when a FELA plaintiff seeks fear-of-cancer damages.  538 U. S., at 159, n.19.  Those include, on a defendants request, a charge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to be genuine and serious.  Ibid.  CSX requested an instruction on the substance of the genuine-and-serious standard, and the trial court erred by not giving one.


The reasons given by the Tennessee Court of Appeals for upholding the denial of an instruction on the standard do not withstand scrutiny.  The court stated that instructing the jury on the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages would have been futile because cancer touches many lives and therefore evoke[s] [jurors] raw emotions.  278 S.W. 3d, at 300.  This is a serious misunderstanding of the nature and function of the jury.

08-598|"BOBBY, WARDEN v. BIES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 08598.Argued April 27, 2009Decided June 1, 2009
In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Prior to Atkins, mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty.  See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Nearly a decade before Atkins, respondent Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy.  Instructed at the sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evidence of Bies mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggravating factors (including the crimes brutality), the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.  Ohios Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, each concluding that Bies mental retardation was entitled to some weight as a mitigating factor, but that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  Bies then filed an unsuccessful petition for state postconviction relief, contending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of a mentally retarded defendant.  Soon after Bies sought federal habeas relief, this Court decided Atkins.  The opinion left to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to determine when a person claiming mental retardation would fall within Atkins compass.  Ohio heeded Atkins call in State v. Lott.  The District Court then stayed Bies federal habeas proceedings so that he could present an Atkins claim to the state postconviction court.  Observing that Bies mental retardation had not previously been established under the Atkins-Lott framework, the state court denied Bies motion for summary judgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim.  Rather than proceeding with that hearing, Bies returned to federal court, arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from relitigating the mental retardation issue.  The District Court granted the habeas petition, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, the Court of Appeals determined that all requirements for the issue preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause were met in Bies case.  It concluded, inter alia, that the Ohio Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had decided the mental retardation issue under the same standard that court later adopted in Lott, and that the state courts recognition of Bies mental state had been necessary to the death penalty judgment.  When the Sixth Circuit denied the States petition for rehearing en banc, a concurring judge offered an alternative basis for decision.  He opined that, under Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, jeopardy attaches once a capital defendant is acquitted based on findings establishing an entitlement to a life sentence; reasoning that the Ohio courts mental retardation findings entitled Bies to a life sentence, he concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred any renewed inquiry into Bies mental state.
Held:The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Ohio courts from conducting a full hearing on Bies mental capacity.  Pp.711.
(a)The alternative basis for decision offered by the concurring opinion at the Sixth Circuits rehearing stage is rejected.  The State did not twice put [Bies] in jeopardy, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitutional sense.  Sattazahn offers Bies no aid, for there was no acquittal here.  Bies jury voted to impose the death penalty.  At issue is his attempt to vacate that sentence, not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase his punishment.  Nor did the state courts mental retardation determinations entitle Bies to a life sentence.  At the time of his sentencing and direct appeal, Penry, not Atkins, was the guiding decision, and the dispositive issue was whether the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.78.


(b)The issue preclusion doctrine, on which the Sixth Circuit panel primarily relied, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins and Lott.  The doctrine bars relitigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.  Initially, it is not clear that the issue of Bies mental retardation was actually determined under the Lott test at trial or on direct appeal.  Nor did the State concede that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott, which had not then been decided.  More fundamental, it is clear that the state courts statements regarding Bies mental capacity were not necessary to the judgments affirming his death sentence.  Instead, those determinations cut against the ultimate outcome.  In holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit conflated a determination necessary to the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not outcome determinative.  The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on Ashes statement: [W]hen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.  397 U. S., at 443.  Bies case does not involve the kind of ultimate fact addressed in Ashe.  There, the State was precluded from trying Ashe for robbing a poker player because he had already been acquitted of robbing a different player in the same poker game, and the acquittal was based on a determination that Ashe was not a participant in the poker game robbery.  Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted, and determinations of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.  Moreover, even if the core issue preclusion requirements had been met, an exception to the doctrines application would be warranted due to the intervening Atkins decision.  Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation under Atkins and Lott are discrete legal issues.  One difference is that mental retardation, urged as a mitigating factor, may instead enhance the likelihood that [a jury will find] the aggravating factor of future dangerousness.  Atkins 536 U. S., at 521.  This reality explains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little incentive to contest retardation evidence.  Because the change in law substantially altered the States incentive to contest Bies mental capacity, applying preclusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.  The federal courts intervention in this case derailed the state-court proceeding.  Recourse first to Ohios courts is what this Court envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing Atkins.  The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under the Atkins and Lott precedents.  Pp.811.
519 F.3d 324, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

certiorari to the court of appeals of new york
No. 0710374.Argued December 3, 2008Decided May 26, 2009
Believing that damages suits filed by prisoners against state correction officers were largely frivolous and vexatious, New York passed Correction Law 24, which divested state courts of general jurisdiction of their jurisdiction over such suits, including those filed under 42 U. S.C. 1983, and replaced those claims with the States preferred alternative.  Thereunder, a prisoner will have his claim against a correction officer dismissed for want of jurisdiction and will be left to pursue a damages claim against the State in the Court of Claims, a court of limited jurisdiction in which the prisoner will not be entitled to attorneys fees, punitive damages, or injunctive relief.  Petitioner filed two 1983 damages actions against correction employees in state court.  Finding that it lacked jurisdiction under Correction Law 24, the trial court dismissed the actions.  Affirming, the State Court of Appeals rejected petitioners claim that the state statutes jurisdictional limitation violated the Supremacy Clause.  It reasoned that because that law treats state and federal damages actions against correction officers equallyi.e., neither can be brought in New York courtsit was a neutral rule of judicial administration and thus a valid excuse for the States refusal to entertain the federal cause of action.  
Held:Correction Law 24, as applied to 1983 claims, violates the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.513.
(a)Federal and state law together form one system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the courts of the two jurisdictions are  courts of the same country, having jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.  Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136137.  Both state and federal courts have jurisdiction over 1983 suits.  So strong is the presumption of concurrency that it is defeated only when Congress expressly ousts state courts of jurisdiction, see e.g., id., at 136; or [w]hen a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule regarding the administration of the courts, Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372.  As to whether a state law qualifies as such a neutral rule, States retain substantial leeway to establish the contours of their judicial systems, but lack authority to nullify a federal right or cause of action they believe is inconsistent with their local policies.  Whatever its merits, New Yorks policy of shielding correction officers from liability when sued for damages arising out of conduct performed in the scope of their employment is contrary to Congress judgment that all persons who violate federal rights while acting under color of state law shall be held liable for damages.  A State may not  relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be frivolous.  Id., at 380.  Pp.58.


(b)The New York Court of Appeals holding was based on the misunderstanding that Correction Law 24s equal treatment of federal and state claims would guarantee that the statute would pass constitutional muster.  Although the absence of discrimination is essential to this Courts finding a state law neutral, nondiscrimination alone is not sufficient to guarantee that a state law will be deemed neutral.  In addition to this misplaced reliance on equality, respondents mistakenly treat this case as implicating the great latitude [States enjoy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.  Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372.  However, this Court need not decide whether Congress can compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise unavailable under state law, to hear 1983 suits, because New York has courts of general jurisdiction that routinely sit to hear analogous 1983 actions.  Pp.813.

Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined as to Part III.

Although the absence of discrimination is essential to this Courts finding a state law neutral, nondiscrimination alone is not sufficient to guarantee that a state law will be deemed neutral.  In addition to this misplaced reliance on equality, respondents mistakenly treat this case as implicating the great latitude [States enjoy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.  Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372.  However, this Court need not decide whether Congress can compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise unavailable under state law, to hear 1983 suits, because New York has courts of general jurisdiction that routinely sit to hear analogous 1983 actions.  Pp.813.

07-1529|"MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana
No. 071529.Argued January 13, 2009Decided May 26, 2009
At a preliminary hearing required by Louisiana law, petitioner Montejo was charged with first-degree murder, and the court ordered the appointment of counsel.  Later that day, the police read Montejo his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he agreed to go along on a trip to locate the murder weapon.  During the excursion, he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victims widow.  Upon returning, he finally met his court-appointed attorney.  At trial, his letter was admitted over defense objection, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected his claim that the letter should have been suppressed under the rule of Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, which forbids police to initiate interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has invoked his right to counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding.  The court reasoned that Jacksons prophylactic protection is not triggered unless the defendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; and that, since Montejo stood mute at his hearing while the judge ordered the appointment of counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.  
Held:
1.Michigan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled.  Pp.318.


(a)The State Supreme Courts interpretation of Jackson would lead to practical problems.  Requiring an initial invocation of the right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption, as the court below did, might work in States that require an indigent defendant formally to request counsel before an appointment is made, but not in more than half the States, which appoint counsel without request from the defendant.  Pp.36.


(b)On the other hand, Montejos solution is untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.  Eliminating the invocation requirement entirely would depart fundamentally from the rationale of Jackson, whose presumption was created by analogy to a similar prophylactic rule established in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, to protect the Fifth Amendment-based Miranda right.  Both Edwards and Jackson are meant to prevent police from badgering defendants into changing their minds about the right to counsel once they have invoked it, but a defendant who never asked for counsel has not yet made up his mind in the first instance.  Pp.613.


(c)Stare decisis does not require the Court to expand significantly the holding of a prior decision in order to cure its practical deficiencies.  To the contrary, the fact that a decision has proved unworkable is a traditional ground for overruling it.  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827.  Beyond workability, the relevant factors include the precedents antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  The first two cut in favor of jettisoning Jackson: the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it would not upset expectations, since any criminal defendant learned enough to order his affairs based on Jacksons rule would also be perfectly capable of interacting with the police on his own.  As for the strength of Jacksons reasoning, when this Court creates a prophylactic rule to protect a constitutional right, the relevant reasoning is the weighing of the rules benefits against its costs.  Jacksons marginal benefits are dwarfed by its substantial costs.  Even without Jackson, few badgering-induced waivers, if any, would be admitted at trial because the Court has taken substantial other, overlapping measures to exclude them.  Under Miranda, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation must be advised of his right to have a lawyer present.  384 U. S., at 474.  Under Edwards, once such a defendant has invoked his [Miranda] right, interrogation must stop.  451 U. S., at 484.  And under Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, no subsequent interrogation may take place until counsel is present.  Id., at 153.  These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient.  On the other side of the equation, the principal cost of applying Jacksons rule is that crimes can go unsolved and criminals unpunished when uncoerced confessions are excluded and when officers are deterred from even trying to obtain confessions.  The Court concludes that the Jackson rule does not pay its way, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907908, n.6, and thus the case should be overruled.  Pp.1318.


2.Montejo should nonetheless be given an opportunity to contend that his letter of apology should have been suppressed under the Edwards rule.  He understandably did not pursue an Edwards objection, because Jackson offered broader protections, but the decision here changes the legal landscape.  Pp.1819.

08-192|"ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 08192.Argued March 4, 2009Decided May 26, 2009
A wiretap of Mohammed Saids telephone recorded six calls in which petitioner Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two separate 1-gram transactions.  Those two purchases were misdemeanors under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S.C. 844, while Saids two sales were felonies, 841(a)(1) and (b).  The Government charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the phone calls, some placed by him, some by Said, violated 843(b), which makes it a felony to use any communication facility in  facilitating felony distribution and other drug crimes.  The District Court denied Abuelhawas acquittal motion, in which he argued that his efforts to make misdemeanor purchases could not be treated as facilitating Saids felonies.  The jury convicted Abuelhawa on all six felony counts.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that facilitat[e] should be given its ordinary meaning in 843(b) and that Abuelhawas use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation because it made Saids distribution of the drug easier.  
Held:Using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not facilitat[e] felony drug distribution in violation of 843(b).  Stopping with the plain meaning of facilitate here would ignore the rule that because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, [a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.  Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486.  Here it does not.  The literal sweep of facilitat[e] sits uncomfortably with common usage:Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the others conduct.  The common usage has its parallel in cases holding that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the legislatures punishment calibration.  In Gebardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112, 119, for example, the Court held that a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to have sex could not be tagged with the Mann Act violation for aid[ing] or assist[ing] interstate transportation for immoral purposes because the statutory penalties were clearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation.  Such cases have a bearing here in two ways.  First, given the presumption, see, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 380381, and n.12, that the Congress that enacted 843(b) was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like aid, abet, and assist, it is likely the Legislature had a comparable scope in mind when it used facilitate, a word with equivalent meaning.  Second, any broader reading would for practical purposes substantially skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties.  Moreover, the statutes historywhich shows that in 1970 the CSA downgraded simple possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, 844(a), and simultaneously limited the communications provisions prohibition of facilitating a drug offense to facilitating a felony, 843(b)drives home what is clear from the statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than felony distribution, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a felony.  Yet, under the Governments reading of 843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simultaneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the same offense, simple drug possession, it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the right.  Given that Congress used no language spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background usage of terms such as aid, abet, and assist that points in the opposite direction and accords with the CSAs choice to classify small purchases as misdemeanors, the Governments position is just too unlikely.  Pp.38.

07-1015|"ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, etal. v. IQBAL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 071015.Argued December 10, 2008Decided May 18, 2009
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, respondent Iqbal, a Pakistani Muslim, was arrested on criminal charges and detained by federal officials under restrictive conditions.  Iqbal filed a Bivens action against numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that petitioners designated Iqbal a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments; that the FBI, under Muellers direction, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th investigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the prohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and that Ashcroft was the policys principal architect and Mueller was instrumental in its adoption and execution.  After the District Court denied petitioners motion to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order doctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.  Affirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had jurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  Concluding that Twomblys flexible plausibility standard obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual allegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable in the context of petitioners appeal, the court held that Iqbals complaint was adequate to allege petitioners personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.  
Held: 
1.The Second Circuit had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Courts order denying petitioners motion to dismiss.  Pp.610.


(a)Denial of a qualified-immunity claim can fall within the narrow class of prejudgment orders reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine so long as the order turns on an issue of law.  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530.  The doctrines applicability in this context is well established; an order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage is a final decision under 28 U. S.C. 1291, which vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.  Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 307.  Pp.78. 


(b)Under these principles, the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction over the District Courts order.  Because the order turned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity defense, it was a final decision subject to immediate appeal.  Behrens, supra, at 307.  Pp.810.


2.Iqbals complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination.  Pp.1123. 


(a)This Court assumes, without deciding, that Iqbals First Amendment claim is actionable in a Bivens action, see Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 254, n.2.  Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens and 1983 suits, see, e.g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead that each Government-official defendant, through his own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.  Purposeful discrimination requires more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences; it involves a decisionmakers undertaking a course of action because of, not merely in spite of, [the actions] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279.  Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.  Pp.1113. 


(b)Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  [D]etailed factual allegations are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face, id., at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 556.  Two working principles underlie Twombly.  First, the tenet that a court must accept a complaints allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of actions elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.  Id., at 555.  Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience and common sense.  Id., at 556.  A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying allegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the complaints framework, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Pp.1316. 


(c)Iqbals pleadings do not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly.  Several of his allegationsthat petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that Ashcroft was that policys principal architect; and that Mueller was instrumental in its adoption and executionare conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  Moreover, the factual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft approved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that petitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds.  Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policys purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  Even if the complaints well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbals arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees categorized as of high interest, but the complaint does not contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory factors.  Pp.1620. 


(d)Three of Iqbals arguments are rejected.  Pp.2023. 


(i)His claim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust context is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules.  Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn governs the pleading standard in all civil actions, Rule 1, the case applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550 U. S., at 555556, and n.14.  P. 20. 


(ii)Rule 8s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on the Second Circuits instruction that the District Court cabin discovery to preserve petitioners qualified-immunity defense in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.  The question presented by a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed on the discovery process.  Twombly, supra, at 559.  And because Iqbals complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.  Pp.2022. 


(iii)Rule 9(b)which requires particularity when pleading fraud or mistake but allows other conditions of a persons mind [to] be alleged generallydoes not require courts to credit a complaints conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.  Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.  It does not give him license to evade Rule 8s less rigid, though still operative, strictures.  Pp.2223. 


(e)The Second Circuit should decide in the first instance whether to remand to the District Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.  P.23.

S.C. 1291, which vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.  Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 307.  Pp.78. 


(b)Under these principles, the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction over the District Courts order.  Because the order turned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity defense, it was a final decision subject to immediate appeal.  Behrens, supra, at 307.  Pp.810.


2.Iqbals complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination.  Pp.1123. 


(a)This Court assumes, without deciding, that Iqbals First Amendment claim is actionable in a Bivens action, see Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 254, n.2.  Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens and 1983 suits, see, e.g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead that each Government-official defendant, through his own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.  Purposeful discrimination requires more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences; it involves a decisionmakers undertaking a course of action because of, not merely in spite of, [the actions] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279.  Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.  Pp.1113. 


(b)Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  [D]etailed factual allegations are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face, id., at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 556.  Two working principles underlie Twombly.  First, the tenet that a court must accept a complaints allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of actions elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.  Id., at 555.  Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience and common sense.  Id., at 556.  A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying allegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the complaints framework, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Pp.1316. 


(c)Iqbals pleadings do not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly.  Several of his allegationsthat petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that Ashcroft was that policys principal architect; and that Mueller was instrumental in its adoption and executionare conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  Moreover, the factual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft approved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that petitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds.  Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policys purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  Even if the complaints well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbals arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees categorized as of high interest, but the complaint does not contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory factors.  Pp.1620. 


(d)Three of Iqbals arguments are rejected.  Pp.2023. 


(i)His claim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust context is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules.  Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn governs the pleading standard in all civil actions, Rule 1, the case applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550 U. S., at 555556, and n.14.  P. 20. 


(ii)Rule 8s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on the Second Circuits instruction that the District Court cabin discovery to preserve petitioners qualified-immunity defense in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.  The question presented by a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed on the discovery process.  Twombly, supra, at 559.  And because Iqbals complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.  Pp.2022. 


(iii)Rule 9(b)which requires particularity when pleading fraud or mistake but allows other conditions of a persons mind [to] be alleged generallydoes not require courts to credit a complaints conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.  Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.  It does not give him license to evade Rule 8s less rigid, though still operative, strictures.  Pp.2223. 


(e)The Second Circuit should decide in the first instance whether to remand to the District Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.  P.23.

07-543|"AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07543.Argued December 10, 2008Decided May 18, 2009
Petitioner companies (collectively, AT&T) long based pension calculations on a seniority system that relied on years of service minus uncredited leave time, giving less retirement credit for pregnancy absences than for medical leave generally.  In response to the ruling in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, that such differential treatment of pregnancy leave was not sex-based discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress added the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to Title VII in 1978 to make it clear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 684.  On the PDAs effective date, AT&T replaced its old plan with the Anticipated Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit for pregnancy leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but did not make any retroactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel policies.  Each of the individual respondents therefore received less service credit for her pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would have for general disability leave, resulting in a reduction in her total employment term and, consequently, smaller AT&T pensions.  They, along with their union, also a respondent, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges alleging discrimination based on sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.  The EEOC issued each respondent (collectively, Hulteen) a determination letter finding reasonable cause to believe AT&T had discriminated and a right-to-sue letter.  Hulteen filed suit in the District Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit precedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that differentiated based on pregnancy.  The Circuit affirmed.
Held:An employer does not necessarily violate the PDA when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only pre-PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for medical leave generally.  Because AT&Ts pension payments accord with a bona fide seniority systems terms, they are insulated from challenge under Title VII 703(h).  Pp.414. 
(a)AT&Ts benefit calculation rule is protected by 703(h), which provides: [I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation  pursuant to a bona fide seniority  system  provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of  sex.  In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 356, the Court held that a pre-Title VII seniority system that disproportionately advantaged white, as against minority, employees nevertheless exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory terms under 703(h), where the discrimination resulted from the employers hiring practices and job assignments.  Because AT&Ts system must also be viewed as bona fide, i.e., as a system having no discriminatory terms, 703(h) controls the result here, just as it did in Teamsters.  This Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, an exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.  429 U. S., at 136.  The only way to conclude that 703(h) does not protect AT&Ts system would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize AT&Ts acts as having been illegal when done.  This is not a serious possibility.  Generally, there is a presumption against retroactivity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.  Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272273.  There is no such clear intent here.  Section 706(e)(2)which details when an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purposehas no application because Gilbert unquestionably held that the feature of AT&Ts seniority system at issue here was not discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so.  Nor can it be argued that because AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so was facially discriminatory at that time.  If a choice to rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination, 703(h) would never apply.  Finally, Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385in which a pre-Title VII compensation plan giving black employees less pay than whites was held to violate Title VII on its effective dateis inapplicable because the Bazemore plan did not involve a seniority system subject to 703(h) and the employer there failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice when Title VII became law.  Pp.413. 


(b)A recent 706(e) amendment making it an unlawful employment practice  when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time  benefits [are] paid, resulting  from such a decision, 3(A), 123 Stat. 6, does not help Hulteen.  AT&Ts pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service credit for pregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with the consequence that Hulteen has not been affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice.  Pp.1314.

Respondents filed a state-court suit alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  After removing the case to Federal District Court under 28 U. S.C. 1441(c), which allows removal if the case includes at least one claim over which the federal court has original jurisdiction, petitioner moved to dismiss the suits only federal claim, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  Agreeing that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted, the District Court dismissed the claim; declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims under 1367(c)(3), which allows such a course if the court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; and remanded the case to state court.  The Federal Circuit dismissed petitioners appeal, finding that the remand order could be colorably characterized as based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the state-law claims, 1447(c), and was therefore not reviewable on appeal, 1447(d).  
Held:A district courts order remanding a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims is not a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is barred by 1447(c) and (d).  With respect to supplemental jurisdiction, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over specified state-law claims, see 1367(a), (c), and its decision whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary, see, e.g., Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 245.  It is undisputed that when this case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction over the federal RICO claim under 1331 and supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims, which were so related to claims  within such original jurisdiction that they form[ed] part of the same case or controversy, 1367(a).  On dismissing the RICO claim, the court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 071601.Argued February 24, 2009Decided May 4, 2009
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those responsible for the contamination.  In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc. (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a parcel of land located in Arvin, California.  B&B later expanded onto an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company (Railroads).  As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored various hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide DD, which it bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell).  Over time, many of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a result of equipment failures.    


Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamination and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA authority to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action against Shell and the Railroads.  The District Court ruled in favor of the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially responsible parties under CERCLAthe Railroads because they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had arranged for disposal  of hazardous substances, 42 U. S.C. 9607(a)(3), through DDs sale and delivery.  The District Court apportioned liability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments total response costs, and Shell liable for 6%.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under 9607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Courts decision in that respect.  Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Governments response costs.
Held:
1.Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the Arvin facility.  Section 9607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond the limits of the statute itself.  Because CERCLA does not specifically define what it means to arrang[e] for disposal of a hazardous substance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning.  In common parlance, arrange implies action directed to a specific purpose.  Thus, under 9607(a)(3)s plain language, an entity may qualify as an arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.  To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into DD sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of 6903(3)s methods.  The facts found by the District Court do not support such a conclusion.  The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during DDs transfer from the common carrier to B&Bs storage tanks after the product had come under B&Bs stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills.  Thus, Shells mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient grounds for concluding that it arranged for DDs disposal.  Pp.813.


2.The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads share of the site remediation costs at 9%.  Calculating liability based on three figuresthe percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&Bs business divided by the term of the Railroads lease, and the courts determination that only two polluting chemicals (not DD) spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contaminationthe District Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for 9% of the remediation costs.  The District Courts detailed findings show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the facility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous-chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, some of which did not require remediation.  Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring remediation.

The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during DDs transfer from the common carrier to B&Bs storage tanks after the product had come under B&Bs stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills.  Thus, Shells mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient grounds for concluding that it arranged for DDs disposal.  Pp.813.


2.The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads share of the site remediation costs at 9%.  Calculating liability based on three figuresthe percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&Bs business divided by the term of the Railroads lease, and the courts determination that only two polluting chemicals (not DD) spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contaminationthe District Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for 9% of the remediation costs.  The District Courts detailed findings show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the facility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous-chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, some of which did not require remediation.  Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring remediation.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 08108.Argued February 25, 2009Decided May 4, 2009
A federal statute forbidding [a]ggravated identity theft imposes a mandatory consecutive 2-year prison term on an individual convicted of certain predicate crimes if, during (or in relation to) the commission of those other crimes, the offender knowingly  uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.  18  U. S.C. 1028A(a)(1) (emphasis added).  After petitioner Flores-Figueroa, a Mexican citizen, gave his employer counterfeit Social Security and alien registration cards containing his name but other peoples identification numbers, he was arrested and charged with two immigration offenses and aggravated identity theft.  Flores moved for acquittal on the latter charge, claiming that the Government could not prove that he knew that the documents numbers were assigned to other people.  The District Court agreed with the Government that the word knowingly in 1028A(a)(1) does not modify the statutes last three words, of another person, and, after trial, found Flores guilty on all counts.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Section 1028(a)(1) requires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.  As a matter of ordinary English grammar, knowingly is naturally read as applying to all the subsequently listed elements of the crime.  Where a transitive verb has an object, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as knowingly) that modifies the verb tells the listener how the subject performed the entire action, including the object.  The Government does not provide a single example of a sentence that, when used in typical fashion, would lead the hearer to a contrary understanding.  And courts ordinarily interpret criminal statutes consistently with the ordinary English usage.  See, e.g., Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419.  The Government argues that this position is incorrect because it would either require the same language to be interpreted differently in a neighboring provision or would render the language in that provision superfluous.  This argument fails for two reasons.  Finally, the Governments arguments based on the statutes purpose and on the practical problems of enforcing it are not sufficient to overcome the ordinary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive practice, of Congress words.

After consulting with petitioners, respondents Wayne Carlisle, James Bushman, and Gary Strassel used a shelter to minimize taxes from the sale of their company.  Limited liability corporations created by Carlisle, Bushman, and Strassel (also respondents) entered into investment-management agreements with Bricolage Capital, LLC, that provided for arbitration of disputes.  After the Internal Revenue Service found the tax shelter illegal, respondents filed a diversity suit against petitioners.  Claiming that equitable estoppel required respondents to arbitrate their claims per the agreements with Bricolage, petitioners invoked 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.

Section 16(a)(1)(A) of the FAA allows an appeal from an order  refusing a stay of any action under section 3.  The District Court denied petitioners stay motions, and the Sixth Circuit dismissed their interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction.
Held:
1.The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of petitioners requests for a 3 stay.  By its clear and unambiguous terms, 16(a)(1)(A) entitles any litigant asking for a 3 stay to an immediate appeal from that motions denialregardless of whether the litigant is in fact eligible for a stay.  Jurisdiction over the appeal must be determined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order, Behrens v.

08-810|"SALLY L. CONKRIGHT etal. v. PAUL J. FROMMERT etal.
on application for stay
[April 30, 2009]
Justice Ginsburg, Circuit Justice.

Sally L. Conkright, Administrator of the Xerox Corporation Pension Plan, etal., have reapplied for a stay of the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  In their initial application, filed October 16, 2008, the applicants sought a stay pending the filing and disposition of their petition for certiorari.   The Second Circuits decision in their case, 535 F.3d 111 (2008), they asserted, was erroneous, created a Circuit conflict, and would cause irreparable harm if given effect.  Without a stay, the applicants explained, they would be required to make additional payments to dozens of pension plan beneficiariesmoney that could prove difficult to recoup if this Court were to grant certiorari and rule in their favor.  


Acting in my capacity as Circuit Justice, I denied the stay application on October 20, 2008.  Denial of such in-chambers stay applications is the norm; relief is granted only in extraordinary cases.  Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in chambers).  Specifically, the applicant must demonstrate (1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari or to note probable jurisdiction; (2) a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous; and (3) a likelihood that irreparable harm [will] result from the denial of a stay.  Ibid.  In addition, in a close case it may be appropriate to balance the equitiesto explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.  Ibid.  I earlier determined, taking account of the Second Circuits evaluation, that this case did not meet the above-stated criteria.


The applicants seek reconsideration based on a change in circumstances.  Specifically, after I denied their initial application, the applicants filed their petition for certiorari, and, on March 2, 2009, the Court called for the views of the Solicitor General (CVSG).  The Solicitor General has yet to respond.  According to the applicants, a stay is now in order because the Courts invitation to the Solicitor Generala step taken in only a small fraction of casesestablishes a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted.


Our request for the Solicitor Generals view, although relevant to the reasonable probability analysis, is hardly dispositive of an application to block implementation of a Court of Appeals judgment.  CVSGd petitions, it is true, are granted at a far higher rate than other petitions.  But it is also true that the Court denies certiorari in such cases more often than not.  Consideration of the guiding criteria in the context of the particular case remains appropriate.


A reasonable probability of a grant is only one of the hurdles an applicant must clear.  Relief is not warranted unless the other factors also counsel in favor of a stay.  The Courts invitation to the Solicitor General does not lead me to depart from my previous assessment of those factors.  With respect to irreparable harm, the applicants urge that, should they prevail in this Court, they may have trouble recouping any funds they disburse to beneficiaries.  But they do not establish that recoupment will be impossible; nor do they suggest that the outlays at issue will place the plan itself in jeopardy.  Cf. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 90 (1974) (Mere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay, are not enough.  The possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation, weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm (internal quotation marks omitted)).


Accordingly, the request for a stay is denied.
It is so ordered.

07-1356|"KANSAS v. VENTRIS
certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
No. 071356.Argued January 21, 2009Decided April 29, 2009
Respondent Donnie Ray Ventris and Rhonda Theel were charged with murder and other crimes.  Prior to trial, an informant planted in Ventriss cell heard him admit to shooting and robbing the victim, but Ventris testified at trial that Theel committed the crimes.  When the State sought to call the informant to testify to his contradictory statement, Ventris objected.  The State conceded that Ventriss Sixth Amendment right to counsel had likely been violated, but argued that the statement was admissible for impeachment purposes.  The trial court allowed the testimony.  The jury convicted Ventris of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.  Reversing, the Kansas Supreme Court held that the informants statements were not admissible for any reason, including impeachment.
Held:Ventriss statement to the informant, concededly elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, was admissible to impeach his inconsistent testimony at trial.  Pp.37.
(a)Whether a confession that was not admissible in the prosecutions case in chief nonetheless can be admitted for impeachment purposes depends on the nature of the constitutional guarantee violated.  The Fifth Amendment guarantee against compelled self-incrimination is violated by introducing a coerced confession at trial, whether by way of impeachment or otherwise.  New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450, 458459.  But for the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures, where exclusion comes by way of deterrent sanction rather than to avoid violation of the substantive guarantee, admissibility is determined by an exclusionary-rule balancing test.  See Walder v. United States, 347 U. S. 62, 65.  The same is true for violations of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment prophylactic rules forbidding certain pretrial police conduct.  See, e.g., Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, 225226.  The core of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a trial right, but the right covers pretrial interrogations to ensure that police manipulation does not deprive the defendant of effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.  Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 204.  This right to be free of uncounseled interrogation is infringed at the time of the interrogation, not when it is admitted into evidence.  It is that deprivation that demands the remedy of exclusion from the prosecutions case in chief.  Pp.36.


(b)The interests safeguarded by excluding tainted evidence for impeachment purposes are outweighed by the need to prevent perjury and to assure the integrity of the trial process.  Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 488.  Once the defendant testifies inconsistently, denying the prosecution the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary process, Harris, supra, at 225, is a high price to pay for vindicating the right to counsel at the prior stage.  On the other hand, preventing impeachment use of statements taken in violation of Massiah would add little appreciable deterrence for officers, who have an incentive to comply with the Constitution, since statements lawfully obtained can be used for all purposes, not simply impeachment.  In every other context, this Court has held that tainted evidence is admissible for impeachment.  See, e.g., Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 723.  No distinction here alters that balance.  Pp.67.

08-5274|"DEAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 085274.Argued March 4, 2009Decided April 29, 2009
An individual convicted for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of such a crime, receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the underlying crime.  18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(A)(i).  The mandatory minimum increases to 7 years if the firearm is brandished and to 10 years if the firearm is discharged. 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).


Petitioner Dean was convicted of conspiring to commit a bank robbery and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery.  Because the firearm was discharged during the robbery, Dean was sentenced to a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term on the firearm count.  924(c)(1)(A)(iii).  On appeal, he contended that the discharge was accidental, and that 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant intended to discharge the firearm.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that no proof of intent is required. 
Held:Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent.  The 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or by accident.  Pp.29.
(a)Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence if the firearm is discharged. It does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.  This Court ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.  Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29.  Congresss use of the passive voice further indicates that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent.  Cf. Watson v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  The statutes structure also suggests no such limitation.  Congress expressly included an intent requirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a firearm by separately defining brandish to require that the firearm be displayed in order to intimidate another person.  924(c)(4).  Congress did not, however, separately define discharge to include an intent requirement.  It is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally when including particular language in one section of a statute but not in another.  Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23.  Contrary to Deans contention, the phrase during and in relation to in the opening paragraph of 924(c)(1)(A) does not modify is discharged, which appears in a separate subsection and in a different voice than the principal paragraph.  [I]n relation to is most naturally read to modify only the nearby verbs uses and carries.  This reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean.  Pp.36.


(b)Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional discharges in order to give effect to the statutes progression of harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct.  While it is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful acts.  The fact that the discharge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blameless.  The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for which the defendant is responsible.  See Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 553.  An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally.  A gunshotwhether accidental or intendedincreases the risk that others will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in response.  It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here.  Pp.69.


(c)Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule of lenity is not implicated in this case. 
517 F.3d 1224, affirmed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J.,  and  Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.

Held:Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent.  The 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or by accident.  Pp.29.
(a)Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence if the firearm is discharged. It does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.  This Court ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.  Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29.  Congresss use of the passive voice further indicates that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent.  Cf. Watson v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  The statutes structure also suggests no such limitation.  Congress expressly included an intent requirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a firearm by separately defining brandish to require that the firearm be displayed in order to intimidate another person.  924(c)(4).  Congress did not, however, separately define discharge to include an intent requirement.  It is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally when including particular language in one section of a statute but not in another.  Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23.  Contrary to Deans contention, the phrase during and in relation to in the opening paragraph of 924(c)(1)(A) does not modify is discharged, which appears in a separate subsection and in a different voice than the principal paragraph.  [I]n relation to is most naturally read to modify only the nearby verbs uses and carries.  This reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean.  Pp.36.


(b)Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional discharges in order to give effect to the statutes progression of harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct.  While it is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful acts.  The fact that the discharge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blameless.  The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for which the defendant is responsible.  See Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 553.  An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally.  A gunshotwhether accidental or intendedincreases the risk that others will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in response.  It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here.  Pp.69.


(c)Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule of lenity is not implicated in this case.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 071114.Argued December 9, 2008Decided April 28, 2009
After the State discredited petitioner Cones defense that he killed two people while suffering from acute psychosis caused by drug addiction, he was convicted and sentenced to death.  The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal and the state courts denied postconviction relief.  Later, in a second petition for state postconviction relief, Cone raised the claim that the State had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by suppressing witness statements and police reports that would have corroborated his insanity defense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death penalty.  The postconviction court denied him a hearing on the ground that the Brady claim had been previously determined, either on direct appeal or in earlier collateral proceedings.  The State Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  Cone then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.  That Court denied relief, holding the Brady claim procedurally barred because the state courts disposition rested on adequate and independent state grounds: Cone had waived it by failing to present his claim in state court.  Even if he had not defaulted the claim, ruled the court, it would fail on its merits because none of the withheld evidence would have cast doubt on his guilt.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the latter conclusion, but considered itself barred from reaching the claims merits because the state courts had ruled the claim previously determined or waived under state law.  
Held:
1.The state courts rejection of Cones Brady claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review.  Neither of the States asserted justifications for such a barthat the claim was decided by the State Supreme Court on direct review or that Cone had waived it by never properly raising it in state courtprovides an independent and adequate state ground for denying review of Cones federal claim.  The state postconviction courts denial of the Brady claim on the ground it had been previously determined in state court rested on a false premise: Cone had not presented the claim in earlier proceedings and, consequently, the state courts had not passed on it.  The Sixth Circuits rejection of the claim as procedurally defaulted because it had been twice presented to the Tennessee courts was thus erroneous.  Also unpersuasive is the States alternative argument that federal review is barred because the Brady claim was properly dismissed by the state postconviction courts as waived.  Those courts held only that the claim had been previously determined, and this Court will not second-guess their judgment.  Because the claim was properly preserved and exhausted in state court, it is not defaulted.  Pp.1519.


2.The lower federal courts failed to adequately consider whether the withheld documents were material to Cones sentence.  Both the quantity and quality of the suppressed evidence lend support to Cones trial position that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during the murders, and that the States contrary arguments were false and misleading.  Nevertheless, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone, the evidence does not sustain his insanity defense: His behavior before, during, and after the crimes was inconsistent with the contention that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of law.  Because the likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have affected the jurys verdict on the insanity issue is remote, the Sixth Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that such evidence was immaterial to the jurys guilt finding.  The same cannot be said of that courts summary treatment of Cones claim that the suppressed evidence would have influenced the jurys sentencing recommendation.  Because the suppressed evidence might have been material to the jurys assessment of the proper punishment, a full review of that evidence and its effect on the sentencing verdict is warranted.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 07582.Argued November 4, 2008Decided April 28, 2009
Federal law bans the broadcasting of any  indecent  language, 18 U. S.C. 1464, which includes references to sexual or excretory activity or organs, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726.  Having first defined the prohibited speech in 1975, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took a cautious, but gradually expanding, approach to enforcing the statutory prohibition.  In 2004, the FCCs Golden Globes Order declared for the first time that an expletive (nonliteral) use of the F-Word or the S-Word could be actionably indecent, even when the word is used only once.  


This case concerns isolated utterances of the F- and S-Words during two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television Stations, Inc.  In its order upholding the indecency findings, the FCC, inter alia, stated that the Golden Globes Order eliminated any doubt that fleeting expletives could be actionable; declared that under the new policy, a lack of repetition weighs against a finding of indecency, but is not a safe harbor; and held that both broadcasts met the new test because one involved a literal description of excrement and both invoked the F-Word.  The order did not impose sanctions for either broadcast.  The Second Circuit set aside the agency action, declining to address the constitutionality of the FCCs action but finding the FCCs reasoning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).    
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
489 F.3d 444, reversed and remanded. 
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIIE, concluding:


1.The FCCs orders are neither arbitrary nor capricious within the meaning of the APA, 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  Pp.919.


(a)Under the APA standard, an agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43.  In overturning the FCCs judgment, the Second Circuit relied in part on its precedent interpreting the APA and State Farm to require a more substantial explanation for agency action that changes prior policy.  There is, however, no basis in the Act or this Courts opinions for a requirement that all agency change be subjected to more searching review.  Although an agency must ordinarily display awareness that it is changing position, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 696, and may sometimes need to account for prior factfinding or certain reliance interests created by a prior policy, it need not demonstrate to a courts satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one.  It suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change adequately indicates.  Pp.912. 


(b)Under these standards, the FCCs new policy and its order finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  First, the FCC forthrightly acknowledged that its recent actions have broken new ground, taking account of inconsistent prior FCC and staff actions, and explicitly disavowing them as no longer good law.  The agencys reasons for expanding its enforcement activity, moreover, were entirely rational.  Even when used as an expletive, the F-Words power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning.  And the decision to look at the patent offensiveness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with Pacificas context-based approach.  Because the FCCs prior safe-harbor-for-single-words approach would likely lead to more widespread use, and in light of technological advances reducing the costs of bleeping offending words, it was rational for the agency to step away from its old regime.  The FCCs decision not to impose sanctions precludes any argument that it is arbitrarily punishing parties without notice of their actions potential consequences.  Pp.1315. 


(c)None of the Second Circuits grounds for finding the FCCs action arbitrary and capricious is valid.  First, the FCC did not need empirical evidence proving that fleeting expletives constitute harmful first blows to children; it suffices to know that children mimic behavior they observe.  Second, the court of appeals finding that fidelity to the FCCs first blow theory would require a categorical ban on all broadcasts of expletives is not responsive to the actual policy under review since the FCC has always evaluated the patent offensiveness of words and statements in relation to the context in which they were broadcast.  The FCCs decision to retain some discretion in less egregious cases does not invalidate its regulation of the broadcasts under review.  Third, the FCCs prediction that a per se exemption for fleeting expletives would lead to their increased use merits deference and makes entire sense.  Pp.1518. 


(d)Foxs additional arguments are not tenable grounds for affirmance.  Fox misconstrues the agencys orders when it argues that that the new policy is a presumption of indecency for certain words.  It reads more into Pacifica than is there by arguing that the FCC failed adequately to explain how this regulation is consistent with that case.  And Foxs argument that the FCCs repeated appeal to context is a smokescreen for a standardless regime of unbridled discretion ignores the fact that the opinion in Pacifica endorsed a context-based approach.  Pp.1819. 


2.Absent a lower court opinion on the matter, this Court declines to address the FCC orders constitutionality.  P.26.

08-681|"NKEN v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 08681.Argued January 21, 2009Decided April 22, 2009
Petitioner Nken sought an order from the Fourth Circuit staying his removal to Cameroon while his petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings was pending.  Nken acknowledged that Circuit precedent required an alien seeking such a stay to satisfy 8 U. S.C. 1252(f)(2), which sharply restricts the availability of injunctions blocking the removal of an alien from this country, but argued that a courts authority to stay a removal order should instead be controlled by the traditional criteria governing stays.  The Court of Appeals denied the stay motion without comment.  
Held:Traditional stay factors, not the demanding 1252(f)(2) standard, govern a court of appeals authority to stay an aliens removal pending judicial review.  Pp.317.
(a)This question stems from changes made in the Illegal Im-
migration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(IIRIRA), which repealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in
[8 U. S.C.] 1105a [(1994 ed.),] and instituted a new (and significantly more restrictive) one in  1252, Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475 (AAADC).  Because courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction before IIRIRA to review the removal order of an alien who had already left the United States, see 1105a(c), most aliens who appealed such a decision were given an automatic stay of the removal order pending judicial review, see 1105a(a)(3).  Three changes IIRIRA made are of particular importance here.  First, the repeal of 1105a allows courts to adjudicate a petition for review even if the alien is removed while the petition is pending.  Second, the presumption of an automatic stay was repealed and replaced with a provision stating that [s]ervice of the petition  does not stay the removal of an alien pending the courts decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.  1252(b)(3)(B).  Finally, IIRIRA provided that no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien  unless [he] shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.  1252(f)(2).  Pp.35. 


(b)The parties dispute what standard a court should apply when determining whether to grant a stay.  Petitioner argues that the traditional stay standard should apply, meaning a court should consider (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether [he] will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties ; and (4) where the public interest lies.  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776.  The Government argues that 1252(f) should govern, meaning an alien must show by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of [the removal] order is prohibited as a matter of law. Pp.56.  


(c)An appellate courts power to hold an order in abeyance while it assesses the orders legality has been described as inherent, and part of a courts traditional equipment for the administration of justice.  Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 910.  That power allows a court to act responsibly, by ensuring that the time the court takes to bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it does not result in irreparable injury to the party aggrieved by the order under review.  But a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant.  Virginian R. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658, 672.  The parties and the public, while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are also entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature has made final.  Pp.67. 


(d)Section 1252(f) does not refer to stays, but rather to authority to enjoin the removal of any alien.  An injunction and a stay serve different purposes.  The former is the means by which a court tells someone what to do or not to do.  While in a general sense many orders may be considered injunctions, the term is typically used to refer to orders that operate in personam.  By contrast, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding itself, either by halting or postponing some portion of it, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.  An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication of a petition for review does not ask for a coercive order against the government, but instead asks to temporarily set aside the removal order.  That kind of stay, relat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.  Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 279.  That 1252(f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays is evident in Congresss use of the word stay in subsection (b)(3)(B) but not subsection (f)(2), particularly since those subsections were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review.  The statutes structure also clearly supports petitioners reading: Because subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering stays of removal, the natural place to locate an amendment to the standard governing stays would have been subsection (b)(3)(B), not a provision four subsections later that makes no mention of stays.  Pp.812.  


(e)Subsection (f)(2)s application would not fulfill the historic office of a stay, which is to hold the matter under review in abeyance to allow the appellate court sufficient time to decide the merits.  Under subsection (f)(2), a stay would only be granted after the court in effect decides the merits, in an expedited manner.  The court would have to do so under a clear and convincing evidence standard that does not so much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it redundant.  Nor would subsection (f)(2) allow courts to prevent irreparable injury to the parties or to the public pending review, Scripps-Howard, 316 U. S., at 9; the subsection on its face does not permit any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise.  In short, applying 1252(f)(2) in the stay context would result in something that does not remotely look like a stay.  As in Scripps-Howard, the Court is loath to conclude that Congress would, without clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary power to stay orders under review.  Id., at 11.  The Court is not convinced Congress did so in 1252(f)(2).  Pp.1213.  


(f)The parties dispute what the traditional four-factor standard entails.  A stay is not a matter of right, and its issuance depends on the circumstances of a particular case.  The first factor, a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, requires more than a mere possibility that relief will be granted.  Similarly, simply showing some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy the second factor.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___.  Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, that burden alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.  An alien who has been removed may continue to pursue a petition for review, and those aliens who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigration status they had upon removal.  The third and fourth factors, harm to the opposing party and the public interest, merge when the Government is the opposing party.  In considering them, courts must be mindful that the Governments role as the respondent in every removal proceeding does not make its interest in each one negligible.  There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders, see AAADC, supra, at 490, and that interest may be heightened by circumstances such as a particularly dangerous alien, or an alien who has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes provided to him.  A court asked to stay removal cannot simply assume that the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the applicants favor. Pp.1316.

			"|"NKEN v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 08681.Argued January 21, 2009Decided April 22, 2009
Petitioner Nken sought an order from the Fourth Circuit staying his removal to Cameroon while his petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings was pending.  Nken acknowledged that Circuit precedent required an alien seeking such a stay to satisfy 8 U. S.C. 1252(f)(2), which sharply restricts the availability of injunctions blocking the removal of an alien from this country, but argued that a courts authority to stay a removal order should instead be controlled by the traditional criteria governing stays.  The Court of Appeals denied the stay motion without comment.  
Held:Traditional stay factors, not the demanding 1252(f)(2) standard, govern a court of appeals authority to stay an aliens removal pending judicial review.  Pp.317.
(a)This question stems from changes made in the Illegal Im-
migration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(IIRIRA), which repealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in
[8 U. S.C.] 1105a [(1994 ed.),] and instituted a new (and significantly more restrictive) one in  1252, Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475 (AAADC).  Because courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction before IIRIRA to review the removal order of an alien who had already left the United States, see 1105a(c), most aliens who appealed such a decision were given an automatic stay of the removal order pending judicial review, see 1105a(a)(3).  Three changes IIRIRA made are of particular importance here.  First, the repeal of 1105a allows courts to adjudicate a petition for review even if the alien is removed while the petition is pending.  Second, the presumption of an automatic stay was repealed and replaced with a provision stating that [s]ervice of the petition  does not stay the removal of an alien pending the courts decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.  1252(b)(3)(B).  Finally, IIRIRA provided that no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien  unless [he] shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.  1252(f)(2).  Pp.35. 


(b)The parties dispute what standard a court should apply when determining whether to grant a stay.  Petitioner argues that the traditional stay standard should apply, meaning a court should consider (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether [he] will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties ; and (4) where the public interest lies.  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776.  The Government argues that 1252(f) should govern, meaning an alien must show by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of [the removal] order is prohibited as a matter of law. Pp.56.  


(c)An appellate courts power to hold an order in abeyance while it assesses the orders legality has been described as inherent, and part of a courts traditional equipment for the administration of justice.  Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 910.  That power allows a court to act responsibly, by ensuring that the time the court takes to bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it does not result in irreparable injury to the party aggrieved by the order under review.  But a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant.  Virginian R. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658, 672.  The parties and the public, while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are also entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature has made final.  Pp.67. 


(d)Section 1252(f) does not refer to stays, but rather to authority to enjoin the removal of any alien.  An injunction and a stay serve different purposes.  The former is the means by which a court tells someone what to do or not to do.  While in a general sense many orders may be considered injunctions, the term is typically used to refer to orders that operate in personam.  By contrast, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding itself, either by halting or postponing some portion of it, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.  An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication of a petition for review does not ask for a coercive order against the government, but instead asks to temporarily set aside the removal order.  That kind of stay, relat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.  Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 279.  That 1252(f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays is evident in Congresss use of the word stay in subsection (b)(3)(B) but not subsection (f)(2), particularly since those subsections were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review.  The statutes structure also clearly supports petitioners reading: Because subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering stays of removal, the natural place to locate an amendment to the standard governing stays would have been subsection (b)(3)(B), not a provision four subsections later that makes no mention of stays.  Pp.812.  


(e)Subsection (f)(2)s application would not fulfill the historic office of a stay, which is to hold the matter under review in abeyance to allow the appellate court sufficient time to decide the merits.  Under subsection (f)(2), a stay would only be granted after the court in effect decides the merits, in an expedited manner.  The court would have to do so under a clear and convincing evidence standard that does not so much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it redundant.  Nor would subsection (f)(2) allow courts to prevent irreparable injury to the parties or to the public pending review, Scripps-Howard, 316 U. S., at 9; the subsection on its face does not permit any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise.  In short, applying 1252(f)(2) in the stay context would result in something that does not remotely look like a stay.  As in Scripps-Howard, the Court is loath to conclude that Congress would, without clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary power to stay orders under review.  Id., at 11.  The Court is not convinced Congress did so in 1252(f)(2).  Pp.1213.  


(f)The parties dispute what the traditional four-factor standard entails.  A stay is not a matter of right, and its issuance depends on the circumstances of a particular case.  The first factor, a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, requires more than a mere possibility that relief will be granted.  Similarly, simply showing some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy the second factor.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___.  Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, that burden alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.  An alien who has been removed may continue to pursue a petition for review, and those aliens who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigration status they had upon removal.  The third and fourth factors, harm to the opposing party and the public interest, merge when the Government is the opposing party.  In considering them, courts must be mindful that the Governments role as the respondent in every removal proceeding does not make its interest in each one negligible.  There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders, see AAADC, supra, at 490, and that interest may be heightened by circumstances such as a particularly dangerous alien, or an alien who has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes provided to him.  A court asked to stay removal cannot simply assume that the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the applicants favor. Pp.1316.
Vacated and remanded.

07-1209|"SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS v. SANDERS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 071209.Argued December 8, 2008Decided April 21, 2009
As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) statutory duty to help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U. S.C. 5103(a).  VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what further information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type Three, respectively.


The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.  7261(b)(2).  It has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the notice was defective.  The reviewing judge will then decide what type of notice error the VA committed.  Under the Veterans Courts approach, a Type One error has the natural effect of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do not.  In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, e.g., by describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudications essential fairness.


The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, rejected the Veterans Courts approach and set forth its own framework for determining whether a notice error is harmless.  When the VA provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in any respect, the framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1) that the defect was cured by the claimants actual knowledge or (2) that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law.  The Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.


In respondent Sanders case, the VA denied disability benefits on the ground that Sanders disability, blindness in his right eye, was not related to his military service.  Sanders argued to the Veterans Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three when it informed him what further information was necessary, but failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary would provide and which portions he would have to provide.  The Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the Federal Circuits framework.


The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons case after finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was not severe enough to warrant compensation.  Simmons argued to the Veterans Court, inter alia, that the VA had made a Type One notice error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show worsening of her hearing.  The court agreed, finding the error prejudicial.  Noting that a Type One notice error has the natural effect of producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the VA told her more specifically what additional information was needed, she might have obtained that evidence.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.The Federal Circuits harmless-error framework conflicts with 7261(b)(2)s requirement that the Veterans Court take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.  Pp.815.


(a)That 7261(b)(2) requires the same sort of harmless-error rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory words take due account and prejudicial error.  Congress used the same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S.C. 706, which is an administrative law  harmless error rule, National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___.  Legislative history confirms that Congress intended 7261(b)(2) to incorporate the APAs approach.  Pp.89. 


(b)Three related features, taken together, demonstrate that the Federal Circuits framework mandates an approach to harmless error that differs significantly from the one normally taken in civil cases.  First, the framework is too complex and rigid: In every case involving any type of notice error, the Veterans Court must find the error harmful unless the VA demonstrates the claimants actual knowledge curing the defect or his ineligibility for benefits as a matter of law.  An errors harmlessness should not be determined through the use of mandatory presumptions and rigid rules, but through the case-specific application of judgment, based upon examination of the record.  See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760.  Second, the framework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA, requiring the Secretary to demonstrate, e.g., a claimants state of mind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might significantly help the claimant.  Third, the framework requires the VA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.  The burden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an agencys determination.  See, e.g., Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 116.  This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when the underlying matter was criminal.  See, e.g., Kotteakos, supra, at 760.  The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil case.  Pp.913. 


(c)The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifications.  First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness of the Veterans Courts reliance on the natural effects of certain kinds of notice errors.  Second, although Congress special solicitude for veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a veterans case error that it might consider harmless in other cases, that is not at issue, and need not be decided here.  Pp.1315.


2.In Sanders case, a review of the record demonstrates that the Veterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless.  The VAs Types Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sanders has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why he has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.  Sanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence proper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not explained how the notice errors could have made any difference. 


In Simmons case, some features of the record suggest that the VAs Type One error was harmless, e.g., that she has long sought benefits and has a long history of medical examinations.  But other features, e.g., that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected and has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.  Given the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether reconsideration is necessary.  Pp.1517.

07-542|"ARIZONA v. GANT
certiorari to the supreme court of arizona
No. 07542.Argued October 7, 2008Decided April 21, 2009
Respondent Gant was arrested for driving on a suspended license, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car before officers searched his car and found cocaine in a jacket pocket.  The Arizona trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, and he was convicted of drug offenses.  Reversing, the State Supreme Court distinguished New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of a recent occupants lawful arreston the ground that it concerned the scope of a search incident to arrest but did not answer the question whether officers may conduct such a search once the scene has been secured.  Because Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, requires that a search incident to arrest be justified by either the interest in officer safety or the interest in preserving evidence and the circumstances of Gants arrest implicated neither of those interests, the State Supreme Court found the search unreasonable. 
Held:Police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a recent occupants arrest only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.  Pp.518.
(a)Warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.  Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357.  The exception for a search incident to a lawful arrest applies only to the area from within which [an arrestee] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.  Chimel, 395 U. S., at 763.  This Court applied that exception to the automobile context in Belton, the holding of which rested in large part on the assumption that articles inside a vehicles passenger compartment are generally  within the area into which an arrestee might reach.  453 U. S., at 460.  Pp.58.


(b)This Court rejects a broad reading of Belton that would permit a vehicle search incident to a recent occupants arrest even if there were no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search.  The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimels exception authorize a vehicle search only when there is a reasonable possibility of such access.  Although it does not follow from Chimel, circumstances unique to the automobile context also justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.  Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Neither Chimels reaching-distance rule nor Thorntons allowance for evidentiary searches authorized the search in this case.  In contrast to Belton, which involved a single officer confronted with four unsecured arrestees, five officers handcuffed and secured Gant and the two other suspects in separate patrol cars before the search began.  Gant clearly could not have accessed his car at the time of the search.  An evidentiary basis for the search was also lacking.  Belton and Thornton were both arrested for drug offenses, but Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended licensean offense for which police could not reasonably expect to find evidence in Gants car.  Cf. Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 118.  The search in this case was therefore unreasonable.  Pp.811.


(c)This Court is unpersuaded by the States argument that its expansive reading of Belton correctly balances law enforcement interests with an arrestees limited privacy interest in his vehicle.  The State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake, and it exaggerates both the clarity provided by a broad reading of Belton and its importance to law enforcement interests.  A narrow reading of Belton and Thornton, together with this Courts other Fourth Amendment decisions, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 103, and United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, permit an officer to search a vehicle when safety or evidentiary concerns demand.  Pp.1114.


(d)Stare decisis does not require adherence to a broad reading of Belton.  The experience of the 28 years since Belton has shown that the generalization underpinning the broad reading of that decision is unfounded, and blind adherence to its faulty assumption would authorize myriad unconstitutional searches.  Pp.1518.

A narrow reading of Belton and Thornton, together with this Courts other Fourth Amendment decisions, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 103, and United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, permit an officer to search a vehicle when safety or evidentiary concerns demand.  Pp.1114.


(d)Stare decisis does not require adherence to a broad reading of Belton.  The experience of the 28 years since Belton has shown that the generalization underpinning the broad reading of that decision is unfounded, and blind adherence to its faulty assumption would authorize myriad unconstitutional searches.

07-615|"MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR THE ARMED FORCES OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07615.Argued January 12, 2009Decided April 21, 2009
In 1997, the International Court of Arbitration awarded petitioner Iranian Ministry of Defense (hereinafter Iran) $2.8 million to settle a dispute with Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., a California company, over a 1977 contract that would have provided Iran with an air combat training system.  When Cubic refused to pay, Iran sued in the Federal District Court in San Diego, which ordered Cubic to pay the award plus interest (Cubic Judgment).  In 2000, respondent Elahi sued Iran in the D.C. Federal District Court, claiming that Iranian agents had murdered his brother.  He obtained a default judgment of about $312 million and sought to collect some of the money by attaching the Cubic Judgment.  Iran opposed the lien under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA).  The California District Court denied Irans immunity claim, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding an exception to sovereign immunity.  This Court vacated and remanded.  Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi, 546 U. S. 450.


On remand, the Ninth Circuit found that a different immunity exception applied, citing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), which permitted holders of terrorism-related judgments against Iran to attach blocked Iranian assets.  The United States had blocked Iranian assets following the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, and the court held that the asset Elahi sought to attach had remained blocked notwithstanding the unblocking orders issued after the crisis was resolved by the Algiers Accords in 1981.  The court reasoned that those unblocking orders had omitted military goods such as the training system underlying the Cubic Judgment.  The court further rejected Irans argument that Elahi had waived his right of attachment, and concluded that he could attach the Cubic Judgment.
Held: 
1.The asset in question was not blocked at the time of the Ninth Circuits decision.  Contrary to that courts holding, the relevant asset is not Irans interest in the air combat training system, but, rather, a judgment enforcing an arbitration award based upon Cubics failure to account to Iran for its share of the proceeds of the systems eventual sale to Canada.  And neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale proceeds it represents were blocked assets at the time of the Court of Appeals 2007 decision.  In a 1981 order, the Treasury Department unblocked transactions involving property in which Irans interest arose after January 19, 1981.  Irans interest in the Cubic Judgment itself arose on December 7, 1998, when the District Court confirmed the arbitration award.  And Irans interest in the property underlying the judgment arose, as the arbitrators ruled, when Cubic completed its sale of the air combat system in October 1982.  Thus, whether Irans interest in property is considered to be its interest in the Cubic Judgment itself or its underlying interest in the sale proceeds, the interest falls within the terms of the Treasury Departments general unblocking order.  Even assuming (as the Ninth Circuit held) that the relevant asset was Irans pre-1981 interest in the training system itself, that asset still was not blocked at the time of the decision below.  Such an interest would fall directly within the scope of Executive Order No. 12281, which required that property owned by Iran be transferred as directed  by the Government of Iran.  No authority supports the contrary conclusion.  Pp. 811.


2.Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment because he has waived his right to do so.  Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VPA) offers compensation to individuals holding terrorism-related judgments against Iran.  It requires those receiving payment to relinquish all rights to  attach property that is at issue in claims against the United States before an international tribunal.  2002(a)(2)(D).  In 2003, the U. S. Government paid Elahi $2.3 million under the VPA as partial compensation for his judgment against Iran, and he signed a waiver form that mirrors the statutory language.  A review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal Case No. B61 demonstrates that the Cubic Judgment falls within the terms of Elahis waiver.  Iran filed that case in 1982, claiming that between 1979 and 1981 the United States had wrongly barred the transfer of the Cubic training system and other military equipment to Iran.  Iran asked the Tribunal to order the United States, among other things, to pay Iran damages.  The United States answered that the Tribunal should set off the $2.8 million represented by the Cubic Judgment against any award.  Iran argued that the Tribunal should not set off the $2.8 million insofar as third parties have attached the judgment.  In the terms of Elahis waiver, therefore, the Cubic Judgment is property, and Case No. B61 itself is a clai[m] against the United States before an international tribunal.  And there remains a significant dispute about whether the Cubic Judgment can be used by the Tribunal as a setoff, placing the Judgment at issue in Case No. B61.  Elahis arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  Pp.1220.


3.Given Elahis waiver, this Court need not decide whether the Cubic Judgment was blocked by new Executive Branch actions following the Ninth Circuits decision.  P.20. 
495 F.3d 1024, reversed.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 0710441.Argued January 21, 2009Decided April 6, 2009
McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, and Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449, generally rende[r] inadmissible confessions made during periods of detention that violat[e] the prompt presentment requirement of [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 5(a).  United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354.  Rule 5(a), in turn, provides that a person making an arrest  must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge .  Congress enacted 18 U. S.C. 3501 in response to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and some applications of the McNabb-Mallory rule.  In an attempt to eliminate Miranda, 3501(a) provides that a confession  shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given, and 3501(b) lists several considerations for courts to address in assessing voluntariness.  Subsection (c), which focuses on McNabb-Mallory, provides that a confession made  by  a defendant , while  under arrest , shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before a magistrate judge  if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and  within six hours [of arrest]; it extends that time limit when further delay is reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to  the nearest available [magistrate].


Petitioner Corley was arrested for assaulting a federal officer at about 8 a.m.  Around 11:45 FBI agents took him to a Philadelphia hospital to treat a minor injury.  At 3:30 p.m. he was taken from the hospital to the local FBI office and told that he was a suspect in a bank robbery.  Though the office was in the same building as the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not bring him before a magistrate judge, but questioned him, hoping for a confession.  At 5:27 p.m., some 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral confession that he robbed the bank.  He asked for a break at 6:30 and was held overnight.  The interrogation resumed the next morning, ending with his signed written confession.  He was finally presented to a Magistrate Judge at 1:30 p.m., 29.5 hours after his arrest, and charged with armed bank robbery and related charges.  The District Court denied his motion to suppress his confessions under Rule 5(a) and McNabb-Mallory.  It reasoned that the oral confession occurred within 3501(c)s six-hour window because the time of Corleys medical treatment should be excluded from the delay.  It also found the written confession admissible, explaining there was no unreasonable delay under Rule 5(a) because Corley had requested the break.  He was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery.  The Third Circuit affirmed.  Relying on Circuit precedent to the effect that 3501 abrogated McNabb-Mallory and replaced it with a pure voluntariness test, it concluded that if a district court found a confession voluntary after considering the points listed in 3501(b), it would be admissible, even if the presentment delay was unreasonable.
Held:Section 3501 modified McNabb-Mallory but did not supplant it.  Pp.818.
(a)The Government claims that because 3501(a) makes a confession admissible if it is voluntarily given, it entirely eliminates McNabb-Mallory with its bar to admitting even a voluntary confession if given during an unreasonable presentment delay.  Corley argues that 3501(a) was only meant to overrule Miranda, and notes that only 3501(c) touches on McNabb-Mallory, making the rule inapplicable to confessions given within six hours of an arrest.  He has the better argument.  Pp.816.  


(1)The Governments reading renders 3501(c) nonsensical and superfluous.  If subsection (a) really meant that any voluntary confession was admissible, then subsection (c) would add nothing; if a confession was made voluntarily it would be admissible, period, and never inadmissible solely because of delay, even a delay beyond six hours.  The Governments reading is thus at odds with the basic interpretive canon that [a] statute should be construed [to give effect] to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.  Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101.  The Government claims that in providing that a confession shall not be admissible, Congress meant that a confession shall not be [involuntary].  Thus read, (c) would specify a bright-line rule applying (a) to cases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does not make a confession involuntary unless the delay exceeds six hours.  But Congress did not write the statute that way.  Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23.  The terms inadmissible and involuntary are not synonymous.  Congress used both in (c), and this Court would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship.  Ibid.  There is also every reason to believe that Congress used the distinct terms deliberately, specifying two criteria that must be satisfied to prevent a confession from being inadmissible solely because of delay: the confession must be [1] made voluntarily and  [2] within six hours [of arrest].  Moreover, under the McNabb-Mallory rule, inadmissible and involuntary mean different things.  Corleys position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and (a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as qualifying McNabb-Mallory.  The Governments counterargumentthat Corleys reading would also create a conflict, since (a) makes all voluntary confessions admissible while (c) would leave some voluntary confessions inadmissiblefalls short.  First, (a) is a broad directive while (c) aims only at McNabb-Mallory, and a more specific statute [is] given precedence over a more general one.  Busic v. United States, 446 U. S. 398, 406.  Second, reading (a) to create a conflict with (c) not only would make (c) superfluous, but would also create conflicts with so many other Rules of Evidence that the subsection cannot possibly be given its literal scope.  Pp.812.


(2)The legislative history strongly favors Corleys reading.  The Government points to nothing in this history supporting its contrary view.  Pp.1315.


(3)The Governments position would leave the Rule 5 presentment requirement without teeth, for if there is no McNabb-Mallory there is no apparent remedy for a presentment delay.  The prompt presentment requirement is not just an administrative nicety.  It dates back to the common law.  Under Rule 5, presentment is the point at which the judge must take several key steps to foreclose Government overreaching: e.g., informing the defendant of the charges against him and giving the defendant a chance to consult with counsel.  Without McNabb-Mallory, federal agents would be free to question suspects for extended periods before bringing them out in the open, even though custodial police interrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures the individual, Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435, inducing people to confess to crimes they never committed.  Pp.1516.


(b)There is no merit to the Governments fallback claim that even if 3501 preserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress cut it out by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which provides that [a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court .  The Advisory Committees Notes expressly identified McNabb-Mallory as a statutorily authorized rule that would survive Rule 402, and the Government has previously conceded before this Court that Rule 402 preserved McNabb-Mallory.

07-1410|"UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 071410.Argued February 23, 2009Decided April 6, 2009
The Navajo Nation has long sought damages under the Indian Tucker Act (ITA) for an asserted breach of fiduciary duty by the Secretary of the Interior in connection with his failure promptly to approve a royalty rate increase under a coal lease (Lease 8580) the Tribe executed in 1964.  Six years ago, this Court held that the Tribes claim for compensation  fails.  United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 493 (Navajo I).  The Court explained that in order to invoke the ITA and thereby bypass federal sovereign immunity, a tribe must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties.  Id., at 506.  Holding that such duties were not imposed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), by the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA), or by 25 U. S.C. 399, the Court reversed a judgment for the Tribe and remanded.  The Court of Federal Claims then dismissed the Tribes claim, but the Federal Circuit reversed, finding violations of duties imposed by the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 25 U. S.C. 635(a), 638, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U. S.C. 1300(e), as well as common-law duties arising from the Governments comprehensive control over tribal coal.  
Held:The Tribes claim for compensation fails.  None of the sources of law cited by the Federal Circuit and relied upon by the Tribe provides any more sound a basis for its lawsuit than those analyzed in Navajo I.  Pp.814.
(a)Navajo I did not definitively terminate the Tribes claim.  Because the Court in that case did not analyze statutes other than the IMLA, the IMDA, and 399, it is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that another relevant statute might have provided a basis for the suit.  However, Navajo Is reasoningparticularly its instruction to train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions, 537 U. S., at 506left no room for that result based on the sources of law relied on below.  P.8.


(b)Lease 8580 was not issued under 635(a), so the Tribe cannot invoke that law as a source of money-mandating duties.  Section 635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25 years, renewable for up to another 25 years.  In contrast, the IMLA allows terms not to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals are produced in paying quantities.  396a.  Mirroring the latter language, Lease 8580s indefinite term strongly suggests that it was negotiated and approved under the IMLA.

The statute certainly does not require the Secretary to follow recommendations of the Tribe as to royalty rates under coal leases executed pursuant to another Act.  Pp.1112.

			"|"UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 071410.Argued February 23, 2009Decided April 6, 2009
The Navajo Nation has long sought damages under the Indian Tucker Act (ITA) for an asserted breach of fiduciary duty by the Secretary of the Interior in connection with his failure promptly to approve a royalty rate increase under a coal lease (Lease 8580) the Tribe executed in 1964.  Six years ago, this Court held that the Tribes claim for compensation  fails.  United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 493 (Navajo I).  The Court explained that in order to invoke the ITA and thereby bypass federal sovereign immunity, a tribe must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties.  Id., at 506.  Holding that such duties were not imposed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), by the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA), or by 25 U. S.C. 399, the Court reversed a judgment for the Tribe and remanded.  The Court of Federal Claims then dismissed the Tribes claim, but the Federal Circuit reversed, finding violations of duties imposed by the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 25 U. S.C. 635(a), 638, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U. S.C. 1300(e), as well as common-law duties arising from the Governments comprehensive control over tribal coal.  
Held:The Tribes claim for compensation fails.  None of the sources of law cited by the Federal Circuit and relied upon by the Tribe provides any more sound a basis for its lawsuit than those analyzed in Navajo I.  Pp.814.
(a)Navajo I did not definitively terminate the Tribes claim.  Because the Court in that case did not analyze statutes other than the IMLA, the IMDA, and 399, it is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that another relevant statute might have provided a basis for the suit.  However, Navajo Is reasoningparticularly its instruction to train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions, 537 U. S., at 506left no room for that result based on the sources of law relied on below.  P.8.


(b)Lease 8580 was not issued under 635(a), so the Tribe cannot invoke that law as a source of money-mandating duties.  Section 635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25 years, renewable for up to another 25 years.  In contrast, the IMLA allows terms not to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals are produced in paying quantities.  396a.

07-581|"14 PENN PLAZA LLC etal. v. PYETT etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 07581.Argued December 1, 2008Decided April 1, 2009
Respondents are members of the Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ (Union).  Under the National Labor Relations Act, the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees within the building-services industry in New York City, which includes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons.  The Union has exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment, 29 U. S.C. 159(a), and engages in industry-wide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York City real-estate industry.  The agreement between the Union and the RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contractors and Building Owners (CBA).  The CBA requires union members to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding arbitration under the CBAs grievance and dispute resolution procedures.


Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.  It owns and operates the New York City office building where respondents worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities.  Respondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Industries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.  After 14 Penn Plaza, with the Unions consent, engaged a unionized security contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security guards for the building, Temco reassigned respondents to jobs as porters and cleaners.  Contending that these reassignments led to a loss in income, other damages, and were otherwise less desirable than their former positions, respondents asked the Union to file grievances alleging, among other things, that petitioners violated the CBAs ban on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on the basis of their age in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.C. 621 et seq.  The Union requested arbitration under the CBA, but after the initial hearing, withdrew the age-discrimination claims on the ground that its consent to the new security contract precluded it from objecting to respondents reassignments as discriminatory.  Respondents then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners had violated their ADEA rights, and the EEOC issued each of them a right-to-sue notice.  In the ensuing lawsuit, the District Court denied petitioners motion to compel arbitration of respondents age discrimination claims.  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, forbids enforcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring arbitration of ADEA claims. 
Held:A provision in a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law.  Pp.625.
(a)Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a straightforward answer to the question presented.  The Union and the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bargained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimination claims, including ADEA claims, would be resolved in arbitration.  This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a conditio[n] of employment subject to mandatory bargaining under the NLRA, 29 U. S.C. 159(a).  See, e.g., Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 199.  As in any contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for other concessions from the employer, and courts generally may not interfere in this bargained-for exchange.  See NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328.  Thus, the CBAs arbitration provision must be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of grievances from the NLRAs broad sweep.  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628.  It does not.  This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of claims brought under the statute.  See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 2633.  Pp.610.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.  Pp.610.


(b)The CBAs arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the Gardner-Denver line of cases.  Respondents incorrectly interpret Gardner-Denver and its progeny as holding that an agreement to arbitrate ADEA claims provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement cannot waive an individual employees right to a judicial forum under federal antidiscrimination statutes..  Pp.1123.


(i)The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered.  Those cases did not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims, but the quite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.  Gilmer, supra, at 35.  Gardner-Denver does not control the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining agreements arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.  Pp.1115. 


(ii)Apart from their narrow holdings, the Gardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vindicate statutory antidiscrimination rights.  That skepticism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.  First, contrary to Gardner-Denvers erroneous assumption, 415 U. S., at 51, the decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek relief from a court in the first instance, see, e.g., Gilmer, supra, at 26.  Second, Gardner-Denvers mistaken suggestion that certain informal features of arbitration made it a forum well suited to the resolution of contractual disputes, but a comparatively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of [employment] rights.  415 U. S., at 56, has been corrected.  See, e.g., Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 232.  Third, Gardner-Denvers concern that, in arbitration, a union may subordinate an individual employees interests to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit, 415 U. S., at 58, n.19, cannot be relied on to introduce a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the Gardner-Denver dicta, there is no reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read.  Mitsubishi, supra, at 628.  In any event, the conflict-of-interest argument amounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the NLRA, see Emporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization, 420 U. S. 50, 62, and Congress has accounted for the conflict in several ways: union members may bring a duty of fair representation claim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability under the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the National Labor Relations Board.  Pp.1523. 


(c)Because respondents arguments that the CBA does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims were not raised in the lower courts, they have been forfeited.  Moreover, although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld, see, e.g., Mitsubishi, supra, at 637, and n.19, this Court is not positioned to resolve in the first instance respondents claim that the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that this question would require resolution of contested factual allegations, was not fully briefed here or below, and is not fairly encompassed within the question presented.  Resolution now would be particularly inappropriate in light of the Courts hesitation to invalidate arbitration agreements based on speculation.  See, e.g., Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79. Pp.2325. 
498 F.3d 88, reversed and remanded. 
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 07588.Argued December 2, 2008Decided April 1, 2009
Petitioners powerplants have cooling water intake structures that threaten the environment by squashing against intake screens (impingement) or suctioning into the cooling system (entrainment) aquatic organisms from the water sources tapped to cool the plants.  Thus, the facilities are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act, which mandates that [a]ny standard established pursuant to section 1311  or section 1316  and applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.  33 U. S.C. 1326(b).  Sections 1311 and 1316, in turn, employ a variety of best technology standards to regulate effluent discharge into the Nations waters.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the 1326(b) regulations at issue after nearly three decades of making the best technology available determination on a case-by-case basis.  Its Phase I regulations govern new cooling water intake structures, while the Phase II rules at issue apply to certain large existing facilities.  In the latter rules, the EPA set national performance standards, requiring most Phase II facilities to reduce impingement mortality for [aquatic organisms] by 80 to 95 percent from the calculation baseline, and requiring a subset of facilities to reduce entrainment of such organisms by 60 to 90 percent from [that] baseline.  40 CFR 125.94(b)(1), (2).  However, the EPA expressly declined to mandate closed-cycle cooling systems, or equivalent reductions in impingement and entrainment, as it had done in its Phase I rules, in part because the cost of rendering existing facilities closed-cycle compliant would be nine times the estimated cost of compliance with the Phase II performance standards, and because other technologies could approach the performance of closed-cycle operation.  The Phase II rules also permit site-specific variances from the national performance standards, provided that the permit-issuing authority imposes remedial measures that yield results as close as practicable to the applicable performance standards.  125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii).  Respondentsenvironmental groups and various Stateschallenged the Phase II regulations.  Concluding that cost-benefit analysis is impermissible under 33 U. S.C. 1326(b), the Second Circuit found the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision unlawful and remanded the regulations to the EPA for it to clarify whether it had relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards.  
Held:The EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.  Pp.716.
(a)The EPAs view that 1326(b)s best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact standard permits consideration of the technologys costs and of the relationship between those costs and the environmental benefits produced governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statutenot necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843844.  The Second Circuit took best technology to mean the technology that achieves the greatest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a reasonable cost to the industry, but it may also describe the technology that most efficiently produces a good, even if it produces a lesser quantity of that good than other available technologies.  This reading is not precluded by the phrase for minimizing adverse environmental impact.  Minimizing admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to the greatest possible reduction.  Other Clean Water Act provisions show that when Congress wished to mandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution, it used plain language, e.g., elimination of discharges of all pollutants, 1311(b)(2)(A).  Thus, 1326(b)s use of the less ambitious goal of minimizing adverse environmental impact suggests that the EPA has some discretion to determine the extent of reduction warranted under the circumstances, plausibly involving a consideration of the benefits derived from reductions and the costs of achieving them.  Pp.79.


(b)Considering 1326(b)s text, and comparing it with the text and statutory factors applicable to parallel Clean Water Act provisions, prompts the conclusion that it was well within the bounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to conclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbidden.  In the Phase II rules the EPA sought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits, limiting variances from Phase IIs national performance standards to circumstances where the costs are significantly greater than the benefits of compliance.  40 CFR 125.94(a)(5)(ii).  In defining national performance standards the EPA assumed the application of technologies whose benefits approach those estimated for closed-cycle cooling systems at a fraction of the cost.  That the EPA has for over thirty years interpreted 1326(b) to permit a comparison of costs and benefits, while not conclusive, also tends to show that its interpretation is reasonable and hence a legitimate exercise of its discretion.  Even respondents and the Second Circuit ultimately recognize that some comparison of costs and benefits is permitted.  The Second Circuit held that 1326(b) mandates only those technologies whose costs can be reasonably borne by the industry.  But whether it is reasonable to bear a particular cost can very well depend on the resulting benefits.  Likewise, respondents concede that the EPA need not require that industry spend billions to save one more fish.  This concedes the principle, and there is no statutory basis for limiting the comparison of costs and benefits to situations where the benefits are de minimis rather than significantly disproportionate.  Pp.916.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the 1326(b) regulations at issue after nearly three decades of making the best technology available determination on a case-by-case basis.  Its Phase I regulations govern new cooling water intake structures, while the Phase II rules at issue apply to certain large existing facilities.  In the latter rules, the EPA set national performance standards, requiring most Phase II facilities to reduce impingement mortality for [aquatic organisms] by 80 to 95 percent from the calculation baseline, and requiring a subset of facilities to reduce entrainment of such organisms by 60 to 90 percent from [that] baseline.  40 CFR 125.94(b)(1), (2).  However, the EPA expressly declined to mandate closed-cycle cooling systems, or equivalent reductions in impingement and entrainment, as it had done in its Phase I rules, in part because the cost of rendering existing facilities closed-cycle compliant would be nine times the estimated cost of compliance with the Phase II performance standards, and because other technologies could approach the performance of closed-cycle operation.  The Phase II rules also permit site-specific variances from the national performance standards, provided that the permit-issuing authority imposes remedial measures that yield results as close as practicable to the applicable performance standards.  125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii).  Respondentsenvironmental groups and various Stateschallenged the Phase II regulations.  Concluding that cost-benefit analysis is impermissible under 33 U. S.C. 1326(b), the Second Circuit found the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision unlawful and remanded the regulations to the EPA for it to clarify whether it had relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards.  
Held:The EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.  Pp.716.
(a)The EPAs view that 1326(b)s best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact standard permits consideration of the technologys costs and of the relationship between those costs and the environmental benefits produced governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statutenot necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843844.  The Second Circuit took best technology to mean the technology that achieves the greatest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a reasonable cost to the industry, but it may also describe the technology that most efficiently produces a good, even if it produces a lesser quantity of that good than other available technologies.  This reading is not precluded by the phrase for minimizing adverse environmental impact.  Minimizing admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to the greatest possible reduction.  Other Clean Water Act provisions show that when Congress wished to mandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution, it used plain language, e.g., elimination of discharges of all pollutants, 1311(b)(2)(A).  Thus, 1326(b)s use of the less ambitious goal of minimizing adverse environmental impact suggests that the EPA has some discretion to determine the extent of reduction warranted under the circumstances, plausibly involving a consideration of the benefits derived from reductions and the costs of achieving them.  Pp.79.


(b)Considering 1326(b)s text, and comparing it with the text and statutory factors applicable to parallel Clean Water Act provisions, prompts the conclusion that it was well within the bounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to conclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbidden.  In the Phase II rules the EPA sought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits, limiting variances from Phase IIs national performance standards to circumstances where the costs are significantly greater than the benefits of compliance.  40 CFR 125.94(a)(5)(ii).  In defining national performance standards the EPA assumed the application of technologies whose benefits approach those estimated for closed-cycle cooling systems at a fraction of the cost.  That the EPA has for over thirty years interpreted 1326(b) to permit a comparison of costs and benefits, while not conclusive, also tends to show that its interpretation is reasonable and hence a legitimate exercise of its discretion.  Even respondents and the Second Circuit ultimately recognize that some comparison of costs and benefits is permitted.  The Second Circuit held that 1326(b) mandates only those technologies whose costs can be reasonably borne by the industry.  But whether it is reasonable to bear a particular cost can very well depend on the resulting benefits.  Likewise, respondents concede that the EPA need not require that industry spend billions to save one more fish.  This concedes the principle, and there is no statutory basis for limiting the comparison of costs and benefits to situations where the benefits are de minimis rather than significantly disproportionate.  Pp.916.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 078521.Argued January 12, 2009Decided April 1, 2009
After the Tennessee state courts rejected petitioner Harbisons conviction and death sentence challenges, the Federal District Court appointed a federal public defender to represent him in filing a habeas petition under 28 U. S.C. 2254.  That petition was denied.  Harbison then sought appointment of counsel for state clemency proceedings.  Because Tennessee law no longer authorizes the appointment of state public defenders as clemency counsel, his federal counsel moved to expand the scope of her representation to include the state proceedings.  In denying the motion, the District Court relied on Circuit precedent construing 18 U. S.C. 3599, which provides for the appointment of federal counsel.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 
Held:
1.A certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U. S.C. 2253(c)(1)(A) is not required to appeal an order denying a request for federally appointed counsel under 3599 because 2253(c)(1)(A) governs only final orders that dispose of a habeas corpus proceedings merits.  Pp.23.


2.Section 3599 authorizes federally appointed counsel to represent their clients in state clemency proceedings and entitles them to compensation for that representation.  Pp.314.


(a) Section 3599(a)(2), which refers to both 2254 and 2255 proceedings, triggers the appointment of counsel for both state and federal postconviction litigants, and 3599(e) governs the scope of appointed counsels duties.  Thus, federally funded counsel appointed to represent a state prisoner in 2254 proceedings shall also represent the defendant in such  proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.  3599(e).  Because state clemency proceedings are available to state petitioners who obtain subsection (a)(2) representation, the statutes plain language indicates that appointed counsels authorized representation includes such proceedings.  Moreover, subsection (e)s reference to proceedings for  other clemency refers to state proceedings, as federal clemency is exclusively executive, while States administer clemency in various ways.  The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not expected to provide each service enumerated in subsection (e) for every client.  Rather, counsels representation includes only those judicial proceedings transpiring subsequent to her appointment, which under subsection (a)(2) begins with the 2254 or 2255 post-conviction process.  Pp.38.


(b)The Governments attempts to overcome 3599s plain language are not persuasive.  First, our reading of the statute does not produce absurd results.  Contrary to the Governments contention, a lawyer is not required to represent her client during a state retrial following postconviction relief because the retrial marks the commencement of new judicial proceedings, not a subsequent stage of existing proceedings; state postconviction proceedings are also not subsequent to federal habeas proceedings.  Second, the legislative history does not support the Government's argument that Congress intended 3599 to apply only to federal defendants.  Congress decision to furnish counsel for state clemency proceedings reflects both clemencys role as the fail safe of our criminal justice system, Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 415, and the fact that federal habeas counsel are well positioned to represent their clients in clemency proceedings.  Pp.814.

07-1372|"HAWAII etal. v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of hawaii
No. 071372.Argued February 25, 2009Decided March 31, 2009
After the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Congress annexed the Territory of Hawaii pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, under which Hawaii ceded to the United States the absolute fee and ownership of all public, government, and crown lands.  In 1959, the Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it all the public lands  held by the United States, 5(b), and requiring these lands, together with the proceeds from [their] sale  , [to] be held by [the] State as a public trust, 5(f).  Hawaii state law also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in trust for Hawaiian citizens.  In 1993, Congress joint Apology Resolution apologize[d] for this countrys role in overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy, 1, and declared that nothing in the resolution was intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United States, 3. 


The Leialii parcel, a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State since 1959 as part of the Admission Act 5(f) trust.  Hawaiis affordable housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians.  After HFDC refused OHAs demand that the payment include a disclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or transfer of the Leialii parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final determination of native Hawaiians claims.  The state trial court entered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme Court vacated that ruling.  Relying on the Apology Resolution, the court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting petitioners argument that the Admission Act and state law give the State explicit power to sell ceded lands.  
Held:
1.This Court has jurisdiction.  Respondents argue to no avail that the case does not raise a federal question because the State Supreme Court merely held that the sale of ceded lands would constitute a breach of the States fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians under state law.  The Court has jurisdiction whenever a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law.  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040.  Far from providing a plain statement that its decision rested on state law, the state court plainly held that the decision was dictated by federal law, particularly the Apology Resolution.  Pp.67.


2.The Apology Resolution did not strip Hawaii of its sovereign authority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee and granted to the State upon its admission to the Union.  Pp.712.


(a)Neither of the resolutions substantive provisions justifies the judgment below.  The first such provisions six verbsi.e., Congress acknowledge[d] the historical significance of the monarchys overthrow, recognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation with native Hawaiians, apologize[d] to [them] for the overthrow, expresse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrows] ramifications, and urge[d] the President  to also acknowledge [those] ramifications, 1are all conciliatory or precatory.  This is not the kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, especially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States.  See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 1718.  The resolutions second substantive provision, the 3 disclaimer, by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have claims against the United States.  The State Supreme Court, however, read 3 as a congressional recognitionand preservationof claims against Hawaii.  There is no justification for turning an express disclaimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recognition of claims against another.  Pp.810. 


(b)The State Supreme Courts conclusion that the 37 whereas clauses prefacing the Apology Resolution clearly recognize native Hawaiians unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands is wrong for at least three reasons.  First, such whereas clauses cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed on them.  See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n.3.  Second, even if the clauses had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaiis rights and obligations, as the lower court found.  [R]epeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___.  The Apology Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest one.  Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional concerns if it purported to cloud Hawaiis title to its sovereign lands more than three decades after the States admission to the Union, see, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n.9, the Court refuses to read the nonsubstantive whereas clauses to create such a cloud retroactively, see, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381382.

07-9995|"RIVERA v. ILLINOIS
certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
No. 079995.Argued February 23, 2009Decided March 31, 2009
During jury selection in petitioner Riveras state-court first-degree murder trial, his counsel sought to use a peremptory challenge to excuse venire member Deloris Gomez.  Rivera had already exercised two peremptory challenges against women, one of whom was African-American.  It is conceded that there was no basis to challenge Gomez for cause.  She met the requirements for jury service, and Rivera does not contend that she was biased against him.  The trial court rejected the peremptory challenge out of concern that it was discriminatory.  Under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, and later decisions applying Batson, parties are constitutionally prohibited from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race, ethnicity, or sex.  At trial, the jury, with Gomez as its foreperson, found Rivera guilty of first-degree murder.  The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the conviction, holding that the peremptory challenge should have been allowed, but rejecting Riveras argument that the improper seating of Gomez was a reversible error.  Observing that the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges and that they are not necessary for a fair trial, the court held that the denial of Riveras peremptory challenge was not a structural error requiring automatic reversal.  Nor, the court found, was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The court added that it did not need to decide whether the trial courts denial was an error of constitutional dimension in the circumstances of Riveras case, a comment that appears to be related to Riveras arguments that, even absent a freestanding constitutional entitlement to peremptory challenges, the inclusion of Gomez on his jury violated the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.
Held:Provided that all jurors seated in a criminal case are qualified and unbiased, the Due Process Clause does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because of the trial courts good-faith error in denying the defendants peremptory challenge to a juror.  Pp.  612.
(a)Rivera maintains that due process requires reversal whenever a criminal defendants peremptory challenge is erroneously denied.  He asserts that a trial court that fails to dismiss a lawfully challenged juror commits structural error because the jury becomes an illegally constituted tribunal, whose verdict is per se invalid; that this is true even if the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges, since criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their state-provided peremptory challenge rights; that the issue is not amenable to harmless-error analysis, as it is impossible to ascertain how a properly constituted jury would have decided his case; and that automatic reversal therefore must be the rule as a matter of federal law.  Riveras arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  If a defendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state courts good-faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern.  Rather, it is a matter for the State to address under its own laws.  There is no freestanding constitutional right to peremptory challenges.  See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 311.  They are a creature of statute, Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 89, which a State may decline to offer at all, Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57.  Thus, the mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, violate the Federal Constitution.  See, e.g., Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21.  The Due Process Clause safeguards not the meticulous observance of state procedural prescriptions, but the fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial.  Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 563564.  Pp.68.


(b)The trial judges refusal to excuse Gomez did not deprive Rivera of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  Ross is instructive.  There, a criminal defendant used a peremptory challenge to rectify an Oklahoma trial courts erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, leaving him with one fewer peremptory challenge to use at his discretion.  Even though the trial courts error might have resulted in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided [Rosss] case, 487 U. S., at 87, because no member of the jury as finally composed was removable for cause, there was no violation of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, id., at 8691.  This Court reached the same conclusion with regard to a federal-court trial in Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S., at 316.  Riveras efforts to distinguish Ross and Martinez-Salazar are unavailing.  First, although in contrast to Rivera, the Ross and Martinez-Salazar defendants did not challenge any of the jurors who were in fact seated, neither Gomez nor any other member of Riveras jury was removable for cause.  Thus, like the Ross and Martinez-Salazar juries, Riveras jury was impartial for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Rivera suggests that due process concerns persist because Gomez knew he did not want her on the panel, but this Court rejects the notion that a juror is constitutionally disqualified whenever she is aware of a challenge.  Second, it is not constitutionally significant that, in contrast to Ross and Martinez-Salazar, the seating of Gomez over Riveras peremptory challenge was at odds with state law.  Errors of state law do not automatically become violations of due process.  As in Ross and Martinez-Salazar, there is no suggestion here that the trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner.  Rather, his conduct reflected a good-faith effort to enforce Batsons antidiscrimination requirements.  To hold that a one-time, good-faith misapplication of Batson violates due process would likely discourage trial courts and prosecutors from policing a defendants discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not compel such a tradeoff.  Pp.810.


(c)Rivera errs in insisting that, even without a constitutional violation, the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge requires reversal as a matter of federal law.  He relies on a suggestion in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 219, that [t]he denial or impairment of the right [to exercise peremptory challenges] is reversible error without a showing of prejudice.  This statement was disavowed in Martinez-Salazar, see 528 U. S., at 317, n.4.  Typically, an error is designated as structural, therefore requir[ing] automatic reversal, only when the error necessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.  Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U. S. 212, 218219.  The mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, in the circumstances here, constitute such an error.  The automatic reversal precedents Rivera cites are inapposite.  One set of cases involves constitutional errors concerning the qualification of the jury or judge.  See, e.g., Batson, 476 U.

			"|"RIVERA v. ILLINOIS
certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
No. 079995.Argued February 23, 2009Decided March 31, 2009
During jury selection in petitioner Riveras state-court first-degree murder trial, his counsel sought to use a peremptory challenge to excuse venire member Deloris Gomez.  Rivera had already exercised two peremptory challenges against women, one of whom was African-American.  It is conceded that there was no basis to challenge Gomez for cause.  She met the requirements for jury service, and Rivera does not contend that she was biased against him.  The trial court rejected the peremptory challenge out of concern that it was discriminatory.  Under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, and later decisions applying Batson, parties are constitutionally prohibited from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race, ethnicity, or sex.  At trial, the jury, with Gomez as its foreperson, found Rivera guilty of first-degree murder.  The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the conviction, holding that the peremptory challenge should have been allowed, but rejecting Riveras argument that the improper seating of Gomez was a reversible error.  Observing that the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges and that they are not necessary for a fair trial, the court held that the denial of Riveras peremptory challenge was not a structural error requiring automatic reversal.  Nor, the court found, was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The court added that it did not need to decide whether the trial courts denial was an error of constitutional dimension in the circumstances of Riveras case, a comment that appears to be related to Riveras arguments that, even absent a freestanding constitutional entitlement to peremptory challenges, the inclusion of Gomez on his jury violated the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.
Held:Provided that all jurors seated in a criminal case are qualified and unbiased, the Due Process Clause does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because of the trial courts good-faith error in denying the defendants peremptory challenge to a juror.  Pp.  612.
(a)Rivera maintains that due process requires reversal whenever a criminal defendants peremptory challenge is erroneously denied.  He asserts that a trial court that fails to dismiss a lawfully challenged juror commits structural error because the jury becomes an illegally constituted tribunal, whose verdict is per se invalid; that this is true even if the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges, since criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their state-provided peremptory challenge rights; that the issue is not amenable to harmless-error analysis, as it is impossible to ascertain how a properly constituted jury would have decided his case; and that automatic reversal therefore must be the rule as a matter of federal law.  Riveras arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  If a defendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state courts good-faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern.  Rather, it is a matter for the State to address under its own laws.  There is no freestanding constitutional right to peremptory challenges.  See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 311.  They are a creature of statute, Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 89, which a State may decline to offer at all, Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57.  Thus, the mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, violate the Federal Constitution.  See, e.g., Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21.  The Due Process Clause safeguards not the meticulous observance of state procedural prescriptions, but the fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial.  Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 563564.  Pp.68.


(b)The trial judges refusal to excuse Gomez did not deprive Rivera of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  Ross is instructive.  There, a criminal defendant used a peremptory challenge to rectify an Oklahoma trial courts erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, leaving him with one fewer peremptory challenge to use at his discretion.  Even though the trial courts error might have resulted in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided [Rosss] case, 487 U. S., at 87, because no member of the jury as finally composed was removable for cause, there was no violation of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, id., at 8691.  This Court reached the same conclusion with regard to a federal-court trial in Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S., at 316.  Riveras efforts to distinguish Ross and Martinez-Salazar are unavailing.  First, although in contrast to Rivera, the Ross and Martinez-Salazar defendants did not challenge any of the jurors who were in fact seated, neither Gomez nor any other member of Riveras jury was removable for cause.  Thus, like the Ross and Martinez-Salazar juries, Riveras jury was impartial for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Rivera suggests that due process concerns persist because Gomez knew he did not want her on the panel, but this Court rejects the notion that a juror is constitutionally disqualified whenever she is aware of a challenge.  Second, it is not constitutionally significant that, in contrast to Ross and Martinez-Salazar, the seating of Gomez over Riveras peremptory challenge was at odds with state law.  Errors of state law do not automatically become violations of due process.  As in Ross and Martinez-Salazar, there is no suggestion here that the trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner.  Rather, his conduct reflected a good-faith effort to enforce Batsons antidiscrimination requirements.  To hold that a one-time, good-faith misapplication of Batson violates due process would likely discourage trial courts and prosecutors from policing a defendants discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not compel such a tradeoff.  Pp.810.


(c)Rivera errs in insisting that, even without a constitutional violation, the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge requires reversal as a matter of federal law.  He relies on a suggestion in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 219, that [t]he denial or impairment of the right [to exercise peremptory challenges] is reversible error without a showing of prejudice.  This statement was disavowed in Martinez-Salazar, see 528 U. S., at 317, n.4.  Typically, an error is designated as structural, therefore requir[ing] automatic reversal, only when the error necessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.  Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U. S. 212, 218219.  The mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, in the circumstances here, constitute such an error.  The automatic reversal precedents Rivera cites are inapposite.  One set of cases involves constitutional errors concerning the qualification of the jury or judge.  See, e.g., Batson, 476 U. S., at 86, 87.  A second set of cases involves circumstances in which federal judges or tribunals lacked statutory authority to adjudicate the controversy, resulting in a judgment invalid as a matter of federal law.  See, e.g., Nguyen v. United States, 539 U. S. 69.  Nothing in those decisions suggests that federal law renders state-court judgments void whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunals composition.  Absent a federal constitutional violation, States are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial courts mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error per se or, as the Illinois Supreme Court implicitly held here, that the improper seating of a competent and unbiased juror could rank as a harmless error under state law.

07-9712|"PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 079712.Argued January 14, 2009Decided March 25, 2009
In exchange for petitioner Pucketts guilty plea, the Government agreed to request (1) a three-level reduction in his offense level under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the ground that he had accepted responsibility for his crimes; and (2) a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range.  The District Court accepted the plea, but before Puckett was sentenced he assisted in another crime.  As a result, the Government opposed any reduction in Pucketts offense level, and the District Court denied the three-level reduction.  On appeal, Puckett raised for the first time the argument that by backing away from its reduction request, the Government had broken the plea agreement.  The Fifth Circuit found that Puckett had forfeited that claim by failing to raise it below; applied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 52(b)s plain-error standard for unpreserved claims of error; and held that, although the error had occurred and was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the third prong of plain-error analysis in that he failed to demonstrate that his ultimate sentence was affected, especially since the District Judge had found that acceptance-of-responsibility reductions for defendants who continued to engage in criminal activity were so rare as to be unknown.
Held:Rule 52(b)s plain-error test applies to a forfeited claim, like Pucketts, that the Government failed to meet its obligations under a plea agreement, and applies in the usual fashion.  Pp.414.
(a)In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) instructs parties how to preserve claims of error: by informing the courtwhen [a] ruling  is made or soughtof the action the party wishes the court to take, or the partys objection to the courts action and the grounds for that objection.  A partys failure to preserve a claim ordinarily prevents him from raising it on appeal, but Rule 52(b) recognizes a limited exception for plain errors.  Plain-error review involves four prongs: (1) there must be an error or defect that the appellant has not affirmatively waived, United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732733; (2) it must be clear or obvious, see id., at 734; (3) it must have affected the appellants substantial rights, i.e., affected the outcome of the district court proceedings, ibid.; and (4) if the three other prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error if it seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings, id., at 736.  The question here is not whether plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but what conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident application.  The breach undoubtedly violates the defendants rights, but the defendant has the opportunity to seek vindication of those rights in district court; if he fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the consequences for that forfeiture as it does for all others.  Pp.46.


(b)Neither Pucketts doctrinal arguments nor the practical considerations that he raises counsel against applying plain-error review in the present context.  The Governments breach of the plea agreement does not retroactively cause the defendants guilty plea to have been unknowing or involuntary.  This Courts decision in Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, does not govern, since the question whether an error can be found harmless is different from the question whether it can be subjected to plain-error review.  Puckett is wrong in contending that no purpose is served by applying plain-error review: There is much to be gained by inducing the objection to be made at the trial court level, where (among other things) the error can often be remedied.  And not all plea breaches will satisfy the doctrines four prongs.  Pp.714.

07-1315|"KNOWLES, WARDEN v. MIRZAYANCE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 071315.Argued January 13, 2009Decided March 24, 2009
Respondent Mirzayance entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) at his state-court murder trial.  During the guilt phase, he sought to avoid a conviction for first-degree murder and instead obtain a second-degree murder verdict by presenting medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore, incapable of the necessary premeditation or deliberation.  The jury nevertheless convicted him of first-degree murder.  After the trials NGI phase was scheduled, Mirzayance accepted his counsels recommendation to abandon the insanity plea.  Counsel believed that a defense verdict was unlikely because the jury had just rejected medical testimony similar to that which would be presented to establish the NGI defense.  Moreover, although counsel had planned to supplement the medical evidence with testimony by Mirzayances parents as to their sons mental illness, the parents refused to testify at the last moment.  Following his conviction, Mirzayance alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his attorneys recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.  The trial court denied relief, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.


Mirzayance then applied for federal habeas relief, which the District Court denied.   The Ninth Circuit reversed, ordering an evidentiary hearing on counsels recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea.  During the hearing, the Magistrate Judge made extensive factfindings, including, inter alia, that the NGI phase medical evidence essentially would have duplicated the evidence the jury rejected in the guilt phase; that counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on the NGI claim because the jurys finding of first-degree murder as a practical matter would cripple Mirzayances chances of convincing the jury that he nevertheless was incapable of understanding the nature and quality of his act and of distinguishing right from wrong; that Mirzayances parents were not simply reluctant, but had effectively refused, to testify; that counsel had made a carefully reasoned decision not to proceed with the NGI plea after weighing his options and discussing the matter with experienced co-counsel; but that counsels performance was nevertheless deficient because Mirzayance had nothing to lose by going forward with the NGI phase of the trial.  The Magistrate Judge also found prejudice and recommended habeas relief.  The District Court accepted the recommendation and granted the writ.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling, among other things, that counsels performance had been deficient because Mirzayances parents had not refused, but had merely expressed reluctance to testify, and because competent counsel would have attempted to persuade them to testify, which Mirzayances counsel admittedly did not.  The court essentially concluded that competent counsel would have pursued the insanity defense because counsel had nothing to lose by putting on the only defense available.  In addition, the court found prejudice because, in the  courts view, there was a reasonable probability the jury would have found Mirzayance insane had counsel pursued the NGI phase.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that federal habeas relief was authorized under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1) because the California Court of Appeal had unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  
Held:Whether the state-court decision is reviewed under 2254(d)(1)s standard or de novo, Mirzayance has failed to establish that his counsels performance was ineffective.  Pp.816.
(a)The State Court of Appeals denial of Mirzayances ineffective-assistance claim did not violate clearly established federal law.  The Ninth Circuit reached a contrary result based largely on its application of an improper review standardit blamed counsel for abandoning the NGI claim because there was nothing to lose by pursuing it.  But it is not an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by this Court.  See, e.g., Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Absent anything akin to the nothing to lose standard in this Courts precedent, habeas relief could have been granted under 2254(d)(1) only if the state-court decision in this case had unreasonably applied Stricklands more general standard for ineffective-assistance claims, whereby a defendant must show both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice, 466 U. S., at 687.  The question is not whether a federal court believes the state courts determination under Strickland was incorrect but whether [it] was unreasonablea substantially higher threshold.  Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473.  And, because Stricklands is a general standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard.  Under the doubly deferential judicial review that applies to a Strickland claim evaluated under the 2254(d)(1) standard, Mirzayances ineffective-assistance claim fails.  It was not unreasonable for the state court to conclude that counsels performance was not deficient when he counseled Mirzayance to abandon a claim that stood almost no chance of success.  Pp.811. 


(b)Even if Mirzayances ineffective-assistance claim were eligible for de novo review, it would still fail because he has not shown ineffective assistance at all.  Mirzayance can establish neither the deficient performance nor the prejudice required by Strickland.  As to performance, he has not shown that counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  466 U. S., at 687688.  Rather, counsel merely recommended the withdrawal of what he reasonably believed was a claim doomed because similar medical testimony had already been rejected and the parents testimony, which he believed to be his strongest evidence, would not be available.  The Ninth Circuits position that competent counsel might have persuaded the reluctant parents to testify is in tension with the Magistrate Judges contrary findings and applies a more demanding standard than Strickland prescribes.  The failure to show ineffective assistance is also confirmed by the Magistrate Judges finding that counsels decision was essentially an informed one made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options, and was therefore virtually unchallengeable.  Id., at 690.  The Ninth Circuits insistence that counsel was required to assert the only defense available, even one almost certain to lose, is not supported by any prevailing professional norms of which the Court is aware.  See id., at 688.  Nor has Mirzayance demonstrated that he suffered prejudice, which requires a showing of a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  See id., at 694.  In fact, it was highly improbable that the jury, having just rejected testimony about Mirzayances mental condition in the guilt phase, would have reached a different result based on similar evidence at the NGI phase.  Pp.1116.
Reversed and remanded.

07-689|"BARTLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, etal. v. STRICKLAND etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina
No. 07689.Argued October 14, 2008Decided March 9, 2009
Despite the North Carolina Constitutions Whole County Provision prohibiting the General Assembly from dividing counties when drawing its own legislative districts, in 1991 the legislature drew House District 18 to include portions of four counties, including Pender County, for the asserted purpose of satisfying 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  At that time, District 18 was a geographically compact majority-minority district.  By the time the district was to be redrawn in 2003, the African-American voting-age population in District 18 had fallen below 50 percent.  Rather than redrawing the district to keep Pender County whole, the legislators split portions of it and another county.  District 18s African-American voting-age population is now 39.36 percent.  Keeping Pender County whole would have resulted in an African-American voting-age population of 35.33 percent.  The legislators rationale was that splitting Pender County gave African-American voters the potential to join with majority voters to elect the minority groups candidate of choice, while leaving Pender County whole would have violated 2 of the Voting Rights Act.


Pender County and others filed suit, alleging that the redistricting plan violated the Whole County Provision.  The state-official defendants answered that dividing Pender County was required by 2.  The trial court first considered whether the defendants had established the three threshold requirements for 2 liability under Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 51, only the first of which is relevant here: whether the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.  The court concluded that although African-Americans were not a majority of District 18s voting-age population, the district was a de facto majority-minority district because African-Americans could get enough support from crossover majority voters to elect their preferred candidate.  The court ultimately determined, based on the totality of the circumstances, that 2 required that Pender County be split, and it sustained District 18s lines on that rationale.  The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that a minority group must constitute a numerical majority of the voting-age population in an area before 2 requires the creation of a legislative district to prevent dilution of that groups votes.  Because African-Americans did not have such a numerical majority in District 18, the court ordered the legislature to redraw the district.    
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
361 N.C. 491, 649 S.E. 2d 364, affirmed. 
Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded that 2 does not require state officials to draw election-district lines to allow a racial minority that would make up less than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the redrawn district to join with crossover voters to elect the minoritys candidate of choice.  Pp.521.


1.As amended in 1982, 2 provides that a violation is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the [election] processes  in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [who] have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.  42 U. S.C. 1973(b).  Construing the amended 2 in Gingles, supra, at 5051, the Court identified three necessary preconditions for a claim that the use of multimember districts constituted actionable vote dilution.  It later held that those requirements apply equally in 2 cases involving single-member districts.  Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 4041.  Only when a party has established the requirements does a court proceed to analyze whether a 2 violation has occurred based on the totality of the circumstances.  See, e.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1013.  Pp.57.


2.Only when a geographically compact group of minority voters could form a majority in a single-member district has the first Gingles requirement been met.  Pp.721.


(a)A party asserting 2 liability must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the minority population in the potential election district is greater than 50 percent.  The Court has held both that 2 can require the creation of a majority-minority district, in which a minority group composes a numerical, working majority of the voting-age population, see, e.g., Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 154155, and that 2 does not require the creation of an influence district, in which a minority group can influence the outcome of an election even if its preferred candidate cannot be elected, see League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, ___ (LULAC).  This case involves an intermediate, crossover district, in which the minority makes up less than a majority of the voting-age population, but is large enough to elect the candidate of its choice with help from majority voters who cross over to support the minoritys preferred candidate.  Petitioners theory that such districts satisfy the first Gingles requirement is contrary to 2, which requires a showing that minorities have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to  elect representatives of their choice, 42 U. S.C. 1973(b).  Because they form only 39 percent of District 18s voting-age population, African-Americans standing alone have no better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than any other group with the same relative voting strength.  Recognizing a 2 claim where minority voters cannot elect their candidate of choice based on their own votes and without assistance from others would grant special protection to their right to form political coalitions that is not authorized by the section.  Nor does the reasoning of this Courts cases support petitioners claims.  In Voinovich, for example, the Court stated that the first Gingles requirement would have to be modified or eliminated to allow crossover-district claims.  507 U. S., at 158.  Indeed, mandatory recognition of such claims would create serious tension with the third Gingles requirement, that the majority votes as a bloc to defeat minority-preferred candidates, see 478 U. S., at 5051, and would call into question the entire Gingles framework.  On the other hand, the Court finds support for the clear line drawn by the majority-minority requirement in the need for workable standards and sound judicial and legislative administration.  By contrast, if 2 required crossover districts, determining whether a 2 claim would lie would require courts to make complex political predictions and tie them to race-based assumptions.  Heightening these concerns is the fact that because 2 applies nationwide to every jurisdiction required to draw election-district lines under state or local law, crossover-district claims would require courts to make predictive political judgments not only about familiar, two-party contests in large districts but also about regional and local elections.  Unlike any of the standards proposed to allow crossover claims, the majority-minority rule relies on an objective, numerical test: Do minorities make up more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the relevant geographic area?  Given 2s text, the Courts cases interpreting that provision, and the many difficulties in assessing 2 claims without the restraint and guidance provided by the majority-minority rule, all of the federal courts of appeals that have interpreted the first Gingles factor have required a majority-minority standard.  The Court declines to depart from that uniform interpretation, which has stood for more than 20 years.  Because this case does not involve allegations of intentional and wrongful conduct, the Court need not consider whether intentional discrimination affects the Gingles analysis.  Pp.715.  


(b)Arguing for a less restrictive interpretation, petitioners point to 2s guarantee that political processes be equally open to participation to protect minority voters opportunity  to elect representatives of their choice, 42 U. S.C. 1973(b), and assert that such opportunit[ies] occur in crossover districts and require protection.  But petitioners emphasize the word opportunity at the expense of the word equally.  The statute does not protect any possible opportunity through which minority voters could work with other constituencies to elect their candidate of choice.  Section 2 does not guarantee minority voters an electoral advantage.  Minority groups in crossover districts have the same opportunity to elect their candidate as any other political group with the same relative voting strength.  The majority-minority rule, furthermore, is not at odds with 2s totality-of-the-circumstances test.  See, e.g., Growe, supra, at 40.  Any doubt as to whether 2 calls for this rule is resolved by applying the canon of constitutional avoidance to steer clear of serious constitutional concerns under the Equal Protection Clause.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381382.  Such concerns would be raised if 2 were interpreted to require crossover districts throughout the Nation, thereby unnecessarily infus[ing] race into virtually every redistricting.  LULAC, supra, at 446.  Pp.1618. 


(c)This holding does not consider the permissibility of crossover districts as a matter of legislative choice or discretion.  Section 2 allows States to choose their own method of complying with the Voting Rights Act, which may include drawing crossover districts.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 480482.  Moreover, the holding should not be interpreted to entrench majority-minority districts by statutory command, for that, too, could pose constitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900.  Such districts are only required if all three Gingles factors are met and if 2 applies based on the totality of the circumstances.  A claim similar to petitioners assertion that the majority-minority rule is inconsistent with 5 was rejected in LULAC, supra, at ___.  Pp.1921.


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, adhered to his view in Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 891, 893 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the text of 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 does not authorize any vote dilution claim, regardless of the size of the minority population in a given district.  The Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, framework for analyzing such claims has no basis in 2s text and has produced  a disastrous misadventure in judicial policymaking, Holder, supra, at 893.  P.1.

			"|"BARTLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, etal. v. STRICKLAND etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina
No. 07689.Argued October 14, 2008Decided March 9, 2009
Despite the North Carolina Constitutions Whole County Provision prohibiting the General Assembly from dividing counties when drawing its own legislative districts, in 1991 the legislature drew House District 18 to include portions of four counties, including Pender County, for the asserted purpose of satisfying 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  At that time, District 18 was a geographically compact majority-minority district.  By the time the district was to be redrawn in 2003, the African-American voting-age population in District 18 had fallen below 50 percent.  Rather than redrawing the district to keep Pender County whole, the legislators split portions of it and another county.  District 18s African-American voting-age population is now 39.36 percent.  Keeping Pender County whole would have resulted in an African-American voting-age population of 35.33 percent.  The legislators rationale was that splitting Pender County gave African-American voters the potential to join with majority voters to elect the minority groups candidate of choice, while leaving Pender County whole would have violated 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

07-773|"VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 07773.Argued October 6, 2008Decided March 9, 2009
Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S.C. 4, authorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, save for [the arbitration] agreement, over a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.


Discover Banks servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland state court to recover past-due charges from one of its credit cardholders, petitioner Vaden.  Discovers pleading presented a claim arising solely under state law.  Vaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Discovers finance charges, interest, and late fees violated state law.  Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a 4 petition in Federal District Court to compel arbitration of Vadens counterclaims.  The District Court ordered arbitration.


On Vadens initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over Discovers 4 petition pursuant to 28 U. S.C. 1331, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law.  The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct this inquiry by looking through the 4 petition to the substantive controversy between the parties.  With Vaden conceding that her state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbitration.  The Fourth Circuit then affirmed.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and may not be predicated on counterclaims.  It concluded, however, that the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides the well-pleaded complaint rule. 
Held:A federal court may look through a 4 petition to determine whether it is predicated on a controversy that arises under federal law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a 4 petition based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole controversy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudication.  Pp.621.
(a)Congress enacted the FAA [t]o overcome judicial resistance to arbitration, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and to declare a national policy favoring arbitration of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner, Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  To that end, 2 makes arbitration agreements in contracts involving commerce valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, while 4 provides for federal district court enforcement of those agreements.  The body of federal substantive law generated by elaboration of 2 is equally binding on state and federal courts.  Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 12.  However, the FAA requir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional basis over the parties dispute.  Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a suit arises under federal law for 28 U. S.C. 1331 purposes only when the plaintiffs statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon [federal law].  Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152.  Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826.  A complaint purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one arising under federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to recharacterization, remains nonremovable.  Pp.611.


(b)FAA 4s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by looking through a 4 petition to the parties underlying substantive controversy.  The phrase save for [the arbitration] agreement indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it would have jurisdiction under title 28 over the controversy between the parties, which is most straightforwardly read to mean the underlying dispute between the parties.  See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32.  Vadens argument that the relevant controversy is simply and only the parties discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult to square with 4s language.  If courts are to determine whether they would have jurisdiction save for [the arbitration] agreement, how can a dispute over an arbitration agreements existence or applicability be the controversy that counts?  The Court is unpersuaded that the save for clause means only that the antiquated and arcane ouster notion no longer holds sway.  To the extent that the ancient ouster doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, FAA 2, the Acts centerpiece provision, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625, directly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any other contract.  Vadens approach also has curious practical consequences.  It would permit a federal court to entertain a 4 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not accommodate a 4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in, or remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so.  In contrast, the look through approach permits a 4 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit.  Pp.1115.


(c)Having determined that a district court should look through a 4 petition, this Court considers whether the court would have [federal-question] jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the controversy between Discover and Vaden.  Because 4 does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain such a courts assistance only if, save for the agreement, the entire, actual controversy between the parties, as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  Here, the actual controversy is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.  The controversy between the parties arose from Vadens alleged debt, a claim that plainly did not arise under federal law; nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit misapprehended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper because Vadens state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal courts door.  Vadens responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discovers charges are merely an aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involving that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.  Section 4 does not give parties license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in order to obtain a federal courts aid in compelling arbitration.  It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Section 4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties controversy.  Allowing parties to commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties controversy pending in state court makes scant sense.  Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the 4 inquiry.  Although FAA 4 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration here, Discover is not left without recourse.  Because the FAA obliges both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agreements, Discover may petition Marylands courts for appropriate aid in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland credit cardholders.  Pp.1520.

However, the FAA requir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional basis over the parties dispute.  Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a suit arises under federal law for 28 U. S.C. 1331 purposes only when the plaintiffs statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon [federal law].  Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152.  Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826.  A complaint purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one arising under federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to recharacterization, remains nonremovable.  Pp.611.


(b)FAA 4s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by looking through a 4 petition to the parties underlying substantive controversy.  The phrase save for [the arbitration] agreement indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it would have jurisdiction under title 28 over the controversy between the parties, which is most straightforwardly read to mean the underlying dispute between the parties.  See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32.  Vadens argument that the relevant controversy is simply and only the parties discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult to square with 4s language.  If courts are to determine whether they would have jurisdiction save for [the arbitration] agreement, how can a dispute over an arbitration agreements existence or applicability be the controversy that counts?  The Court is unpersuaded that the save for clause means only that the antiquated and arcane ouster notion no longer holds sway.  To the extent that the ancient ouster doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, FAA 2, the Acts centerpiece provision, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625, directly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any other contract.  Vadens approach also has curious practical consequences.  It would permit a federal court to entertain a 4 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not accommodate a 4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in, or remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so.  In contrast, the look through approach permits a 4 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit.  Pp.1115.


(c)Having determined that a district court should look through a 4 petition, this Court considers whether the court would have [federal-question] jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the controversy between Discover and Vaden.  Because 4 does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain such a courts assistance only if, save for the agreement, the entire, actual controversy between the parties, as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  Here, the actual controversy is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.  The controversy between the parties arose from Vadens alleged debt, a claim that plainly did not arise under federal law; nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit misapprehended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper because Vadens state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal courts door.  Vadens responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discovers charges are merely an aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involving that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.  Section 4 does not give parties license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in order to obtain a federal courts aid in compelling arbitration.  It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Section 4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties controversy.  Allowing parties to commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties controversy pending in state court makes scant sense.  Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the 4 inquiry.  Although FAA 4 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration here, Discover is not left without recourse.  Because the FAA obliges both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agreements, Discover may petition Marylands courts for appropriate aid in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland credit cardholders.

08-88|"VERMONT v. BRILLON
certiorari to the supreme court of vermont
No. 0888.Argued January 13, 2009Decided March 9, 2009
In July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.  Nearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.  During the time between his arrest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to represent him.  Brillon fired his first attorney, who served from July 2001 to February 2002.  His third lawyer, who served from March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he reported that Brillon had threatened his life.  His fourth lawyer served from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released him from the case.  His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later, withdrew in April 2003.  Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.  


The trial court denied Brillons motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial.  The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, holding that Brillons conviction must be vacated, and the charges against him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial required by the Sixth Amendment.  Citing the balancing test this Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, the Vermont Supreme Court concluded that all four factors described in Barker[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendants assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant, id., at 530weighed against the State.  Weighing heavily in Brillons favor, the Vermont court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was extreme.  In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately considered the period of each counsels representation.  It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first and third lawyers, should not count against the State.  But the court counted much of the remaining two years against the State.  Delays in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part, by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel, over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward.  As for the third and fourth Barker v. Wingo factors, the court found that Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.  
Held: The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system.  Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.  Pp.611.
(a)Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillons trial.  In applying Barker, the Court has asked whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.  Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651.  Delay to hamper the defense weighs heavily against the prosecution, Barker, 407 U. S., at 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant, id., at 529.  Because the attorney is the [defendants] agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, delay caused by the defendants counsel is charged against the defendant.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753.  The same principle applies whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for [o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused, the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender program.  Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 318.  Unlike a prosecutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a state actor.  Pp.68. 


(b)Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would not prompt this Courts review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a fundamental error in its application of Barker that calls for this Courts correction.  The court erred in attributing to the State delays caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillons case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of Brillons disruptive behavior in the overall balance.  Pp.811. 


(1)An assigned counsels failure to move the case forward does not warrant attribution of delay to the State.  Most of the delay the Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time extensions.  Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned counsel.  A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds.  Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance requests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay tactic.  Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately retained counsels requests for time extensions.  There is no justification for treating defendants speedy-trial claims differently based on whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.  Pp.910.  


(2)The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the period of each counsels representation discretely.  The court failed appropriately to take into account Brillons role during the first year of delay.  Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of trial.  His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third attorney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult for the Defender Generals office to find replacement counsel.  Absent Brillons efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attorneys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen.  Pp.1011.


(c)The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by assigned counsel is not absolute.  Delay resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the State.  Cf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324325.  But the Vermont Supreme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record suggests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in Brillons case.  P.11.

06-1249|"WYETH v. LEVINE
certiorari to the supreme court of vermont
No. 061249.Argued November 3, 2008Decided March 4, 2009
Petitioner Wyeth manufactures the antinausea drug Phenergan.  After a clinician injected respondent Levine with Phenergan by the IV-push method, whereby a drug is injected directly into a patients vein, the drug entered Levines artery, she developed gangrene, and doctors amputated her forearm.  Levine brought a state-law damages action, alleging, inter alia, that Wyeth had failed to provide an adequate warning about the significant risks of administering Phenergan by the IV-push method.  The Vermont jury determined that Levines injury would not have occurred if Phenergans label included an adequate warning, and it awarded damages for her pain and suffering, substantial medical expenses, and loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.  Declining to overturn the verdict, the trial court rejected Wyeths argument that Levines failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law because Phenergans labeling had been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  
Held:Federal law does not pre-empt Levines claim that Phenergans label did not contain an adequate warning about the IV-push method of administration.  Pp.625.
(a)The argument that Levines state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties is rejected.  Although a manufacturer generally may change a drug label only after the FDA approves a supplemental application, the agencys changes being effected (CBE) regulation permits certain preapproval labeling changes that add or strengthen a warning to improve drug safety.  Pursuant to the CBE regulation, Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration, and there is no evidence that the FDA would ultimately have rejected such a labeling change.  Wyeths cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad assertion that unilaterally changing the Phenergan label would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution and misbranding of drugs are based on the fundamental misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling.  It is a central premise of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDAs regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.  Pp.1116. 


(b)Wyeths argument that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is meritless because it relies on an untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agencys power to pre-empt state law.  The history of the FDCA shows that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.  In advancing the argument that the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDAs statutorily prescribed role.  Although an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agencys assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agencys explanation of state laws impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf., e.g., Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134.  Under this standard, the FDAs 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDAs failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress purposes; and it reverses the FDAs own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.

07-463|"SUMMERS etal. v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07463.Argued October 8, 2008Decided March 3, 2009
After the U. S. Forest Service approved the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres of fire-damaged federal land, respondent environmentalist organizations filed suit to enjoin the Service from applying its regulations exempting such small sales from the notice, comment, and appeal process it uses for more significant land management decisions, and to challenge other regulations that did not apply to Burnt Ridge.  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the sale, and the parties then settled their dispute as to Burnt Ridge.  Although concluding that the sale was no longer at issue, and despite the Governments argument that respondents therefore lacked standing to challenge the regulations, the court nevertheless proceeded to adjudicate the merits of their challenges, invalidating several regulations, including the notice and comment and the appeal provisions.  Among its rulings, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the determination that the latter regulations, which were applicable to Burnt Ridge, were contrary to law, but held that challenges to other regulations not at issue in that project were not ripe for adjudication.  
Held:Respondents lack standing to challenge the regulations still at issue absent a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.  Pp.412.
(a)In limiting the judicial power to Cases and Controversies, Article III restricts it to redressing or preventing actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by violation of law.  See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559560.  The standing doctrine reflects this fundamental limitation, requiring that the plaintiff  alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction, Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498499.  Here, respondents can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations will affect them in such a manner.  Pp.45.


(b)As organizations, respondents can assert their members standing.  Harm to their members recreational, or even their mere esthetic, interests in the National Forests will suffice to establish the requisite concrete and particularized injury, see Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734736, but generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone suffice.  Respondents have identified no application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to their members interests.  Respondents argument that they have standing based on Burnt Ridge fails because, after voluntarily settling the portion of their lawsuit relevant to Burnt Ridge, respondents and their members are no longer under threat of injury from that project.  The remaining affidavit submitted in support of standing fails to establish that any member has concrete plans to visit a site where the challenged regulations are being applied in a manner that will harm that members concrete interests.  Additional affidavits purporting to establish standing were submitted after judgment had already been entered and notice of appeal filed, and are thus untimely.  Pp.58.


(c)Respondents argument that they have standing because they have suffered procedural injuryi.e., they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so deniedfails because such a deprivation without some concrete interest affected thereby is insufficient to create Article III standing.  See, e.g., Defenders of Wildlife, supra, at 572, n. 7.  Pp.89.


(d)The dissents objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp.912.
490 F.3d 687, reversed in part and affirmed in part.

Forest Service approved the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres of fire-damaged federal land, respondent environmentalist organizations filed suit to enjoin the Service from applying its regulations exempting such small sales from the notice, comment, and appeal process it uses for more significant land management decisions, and to challenge other regulations that did not apply to Burnt Ridge.  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the sale, and the parties then settled their dispute as to Burnt Ridge.  Although concluding that the sale was no longer at issue, and despite the Governments argument that respondents therefore lacked standing to challenge the regulations, the court nevertheless proceeded to adjudicate the merits of their challenges, invalidating several regulations, including the notice and comment and the appeal provisions.  Among its rulings, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the determination that the latter regulations, which were applicable to Burnt Ridge, were contrary to law, but held that challenges to other regulations not at issue in that project were not ripe for adjudication.  
Held:Respondents lack standing to challenge the regulations still at issue absent a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.  Pp.412.
(a)In limiting the judicial power to Cases and Controversies, Article III restricts it to redressing or preventing actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by violation of law.  See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559560.  The standing doctrine reflects this fundamental limitation, requiring that the plaintiff  alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction, Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498499.  Here, respondents can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations will affect them in such a manner.  Pp.45.


(b)As organizations, respondents can assert their members standing.  Harm to their members recreational, or even their mere esthetic, interests in the National Forests will suffice to establish the requisite concrete and particularized injury, see Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734736, but generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone suffice.  Respondents have identified no application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to their members interests.  Respondents argument that they have standing based on Burnt Ridge fails because, after voluntarily settling the portion of their lawsuit relevant to Burnt Ridge, respondents and their members are no longer under threat of injury from that project.  The remaining affidavit submitted in support of standing fails to establish that any member has concrete plans to visit a site where the challenged regulations are being applied in a manner that will harm that members concrete interests.  Additional affidavits purporting to establish standing were submitted after judgment had already been entered and notice of appeal filed, and are thus untimely.  Pp.58.


(c)Respondents argument that they have standing because they have suffered procedural injuryi.e., they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so deniedfails because such a deprivation without some concrete interest affected thereby is insufficient to create Article III standing.  See, e.g., Defenders of Wildlife, supra, at 572, n. 7.  Pp.89.


(d)The dissents objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp.912.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 07499.Argued November 5, 2008Decided March 3, 2009
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars an alien from obtaining refugee status in this country if he assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(42).  This so-called persecutor bar applies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).  During the time petitioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds protected under 1101(a)(42).  After escaping to the United States, petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal.  Concluding that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, inter alia, that the persecutor bar applies even if the aliens assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress.  The BIA followed its earlier decisions finding Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S. 490, controlling.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its precedent following the same reasoning.  
Held: The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied Fedorenko as mandating that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immaterial for prosecutor-bar purposes.  The BIA must interpret the statute, free from this mistaken legal premise, in the first instance.  Pp.412.
(a)Under Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842843, the BIA is entitled to deference in interpreting ambiguous INA provisions, see, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424425.  When the BIA has not spoken on a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands, this Courts ordinary rule is to remand to allow the BIA  to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own experience.  INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 1617.  Pp.45. 


(b)As there is substance both to petitioners contention that involuntary acts cannot implicate the persecutor bar because persecution presumes moral blameworthiness, and to the Governments argument that the question at issue is answered by the statutes failure to provide an exception for coerced conduct, it must be concluded that the INA has an ambiguity that the BIA should address in the first instance.  Fedorenko, which addressed a different statute enacted for a different purpose, does not control the BIAs interpretation of this persecutor bar.  In holding that voluntariness was not required with respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), Fedorenko contrasted the omission there of the word voluntary with the words inclusion in a related statutory subsection.  449 U. S., at 512.  Because Congress did not use the word voluntary anywhere in the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same significance as it did in Fedorenko.  Moreover, the DPAs exclusion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in persecution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror, see id., at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was enacted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and displaced persons, see, e.g., Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 427.  Pp.58.  


(c)Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed Chevron deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented here.  In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has developed in its cases: An aliens motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue whether he assisted in persecution; rather, his actions objective effect controls.  A reading of those decisions confirms that the BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has deemed its interpretation to be mandated by Fedorenko.  This error prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question presented.  Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statutory purpose.  The BIA is not bound to apply the Fedorenko rule to the persecutor bar here at issue.  Whether the statute permits such an interpretation based on a different course of reasoning must be determined in the first instance by the agency.  Pp.810. 


(d)Because the BIA has not yet exercised its Chevron discretion to interpret the statute, the proper course is to remand to it for additional investigation or explanation, e.g., Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U. S. 183, 186, allowing it to bring its expertise to bear on the matter, evaluate the evidence, make an initial determination, and thereby help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides, e.g., id., at 186187.  Pp.1012.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07512.Argued December 8, 2008Decided February 25, 2009
Petitioners (hereinafter AT&T) own infrastructure and facilities needed to provide DSL service, a method of connecting to the Internet at high speeds over telephone lines.  As a condition for a recent merger, the Federal Communications Commission requires AT&T to provide wholesale DSL transport service to independent firms at a price no greater than the retail price of AT&Ts DSL service.  The plaintiffs in this case, respondents here, are independent Internet service providers that compete with AT&T in the retail DSL market in California.  The plaintiffs do not own all the facilities needed to supply DSL service, and must lease wholesale DSL transport service from AT&T.  They filed suit under 2 of the Sherman Act, asserting that AT&T unlawfully squeezed their profit margins by setting a high price for the wholesale DSL transport service it sells and a low price for its own retail DSL service.  This maneuver allegedly placed the plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage, allowing AT&T to maintain monopoly power in the DSL market.  AT&T moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs claims were foreclosed by Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398, 410, in which this Court held that a firm with no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals has no obligation to provide those rivals with a sufficient level of service.  The District Court found that AT&T had no antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiffs, but nonetheless denied the motion, holding that Trinko did not address price-squeeze claims.  The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal on the question whether Trinko bars price-squeeze claims when the parties are required to deal by federal communications law, but not antitrust law.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Trinko did not address the viability of price-squeeze claims, and thus the plaintiffs complaint stated a potentially valid 2 claim.
Held: 
1.The case is not moot.  The plaintiffs now agree that their claims must meet the Brooke Group test for predatory pricing, apparently apart from their price-squeeze theory.  That test established two requirements for predatory pricing: below-cost retail pricing and a dangerous probability that the defendant will recoup any lost profits, see Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209, 222224.  Despite the plaintiffs new position, the parties continue to seek different relief: AT&T seeks reversal of the decision below and dismissal of the complaint, while the plaintiffs seek leave to amend their complaint to allege a Brooke Group claim.  It is also not clear that the plaintiffs have unequivocally abandoned their price-squeeze claims.  Prudential concerns favor answering the question presented; absent a decision on the merits, the Circuit conflict that this Court granted certiorari to resolve would persist.  Pp.57.


2.A price-squeeze claim may not be brought under 2 when the defendant has no antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiff at wholesale.  Pp.717.


(a)Businesses are generally free to choose the parties with whom they will deal, as well as the prices, terms, and conditions of that dealing.  See United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 307.  But in rare circumstances, a dominant firm may incur antitrust liability for purely unilateral conduct, such as charging predatory prices.  Brooke Group, supra, at 222224.  There are also limited circumstances in which a firms unilateral refusal to deal with its rivals can give rise to antitrust liability.  See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, 608611.  Here, plaintiffs do not allege predatory pricing, and the District Court concluded that there was no antitrust duty to deal.  Plaintiffs challenge a different type of unilateral conduct in which a firm squeezes its competitors profit margins.  This requires the defendant to operate in both the wholesale (upstream) and retail (downstream) markets.  By raising the wholesale price of inputs while cutting its own retail prices, the defendant can raise competitors costs while putting downward pressure on their revenues.  Price-squeeze plaintiffs assert that defendants must leave them a fair or adequate margin between wholesale and retail prices.  Pp.79.


(b)Where there is no duty to deal at the wholesale level and no predatory pricing at the retail level, a firm is not required to price both of these services in a manner that preserves its rivals profit margins.  Pp.912.


(1)Any challenge to AT&Ts wholesale prices is foreclosed by a straightforward application of Trinko.  The claim in Trinko addressed the quality of Verizons support services, while the claims in this case challenge AT&Ts pricing structure.  But for antitrust purposes, there is no meaningful distinction between price and nonprice components of a transaction.  The nub of the complaint in both cases is identicalthe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants (upstream monopolists) abused their power in the wholesale market to prevent rival firms from competing effectively in the retail market.  But a firm with no antitrust duty to deal in the wholesale market has no obligation to deal under terms and conditions favorable to its competitors.  See Trinko, supra, at 410.  Had AT&T simply stopped providing DSL transport service to the plaintiffs, it would not have run afoul of the Sherman Act.  Thus, it was not required to offer this service at the wholesale prices the plaintiffs would have preferred.  Pp.910.


(2)The other component of a price-squeeze claim is the assertion that the defendants retail prices are too low.  Here too plaintiffs claims find no support in existing antitrust doctrine.  [C]utting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.  Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 594.  To avoid chilling aggressive price competition, the Court has carefully limited the circumstances under which plaintiffs can state a Sherman Act claim by alleging that the defendants prices are too low.  See Brooke Group, supra, at 222224.  The complaint at issue here has no allegation that AT&Ts conduct met either Brooke Group requirement.  Recognizing a price-squeeze claim where the defendants retail price remains above cost would invite the precise harm the Court sought to avoid in Brooke Group: Firms might raise retail prices or refrain from aggressive price competition to avoid potential antitrust liability.  See 509 U. S., at 223.  Pp. 1112.


(c)Institutional concerns also counsel against recognizing such claims.  This Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of clear rules in antitrust law.  Recognizing price-squeeze claims would require courts simultaneously to police both the wholesale and retail prices to ensure that rival firms are not being squeezed.  Courts would be aiming at a moving target, since it is the interaction between these two prices that may result in a squeeze.  Moreover, firms seeking to avoid price-squeeze liability will have no safe harbor for their pricing practices.  The most commonly articulated standard for price squeezes is that the defendant must leave its rivals a fair or adequate margin between wholesale and retail prices; this test is nearly impossible for courts to apply without conducting complex proceedings like rate-setting agencies.  Some amici argue that a price squeeze should be presumed if the defendants wholesale price exceeds its retail price.  But if both the wholesale price and the retail price are independently lawful, there is no basis for imposing antitrust liability simply because a vertically integrated firms wholesale price is greater than or equal to its retail price.  Pp.1215.


(d)The District Court on remand should consider whether an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs states a claim upon which relief may be granted under the pleading standard articulated in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 561563; whether plaintiffs should be given leave to amend their complaint to bring a Brooke Group claim; and such other matters properly before it.  Pp.1517.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 07665.Argued November 12, 2008Decided February 25, 2009
Pioneer Park (Park), a public park in petitioner Pleasant Grove City (City), has at least 11 permanent, privately donated displays, including a Ten Commandments monument.  In rejecting the request of respondent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the Citys history or donated by groups with longstanding community ties.  After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, respondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monuments historical significance or respondents connection to the community.  The City rejected the request, and respondent filed suit, claiming that the City and petitioner officials had violated the First Amendments Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments monument but rejecting respondents proposed monument.  The District Court denied respondents preliminary injunction request, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  Noting that it had previously found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than government speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded as public forums, the court held that, because the exclusion of the monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was required to erect it immediately.
Held:The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.  Pp.418.
(a)Because that Clause restricts government regulation of private speech but not government speech, whether petitioners were engaging in their own expressive conduct or providing a forum for private speech determines which precedents govern here.  Pp.47.


(1)A government entity is entitled to say what it wishes, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 833, and to select the views that it wants to express, see, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 194.  It may exercise this same freedom when it receives private assistance for the purpose of delivering a government-controlled message.  See Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550, 562.  This does not mean that there are no restraints on government speech.  For example, government speech must comport with the Establishment Clause.  In addition, public officials involvement in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or practice; and a government entity is ultimately accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy, Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 235.  Pp.46.


(2)In contrast, government entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private speech in traditional public fora.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800.  Reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions are allowed, see Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45, but content-based restrictions must satisfy strict scrutiny, i.e., they must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, see Cornelius, supra, at 800.  Restrictions based on viewpoint are also prohibited.  Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 463.  Government restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum.  Cornelius, supra, at 800.  And where government creates a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated to the discussion of certain subjects, Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n.7, it may impose reasonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions, see Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106107.  Pp.67.


(b)Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically represent government speech.  Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public.  Thus, a government-commissioned and government-financed monument placed on public land constitutes government speech.  So, too, are privately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts for public display on government land.  While government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of selective receptivity.  Because city parks play an important role in defining the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting those that portray what the government decisionmakers view as appropriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and local culture.  The accepted monuments are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message and thus constitute government speech.  Pp.710.


(c)Here, the Parks monuments clearly represent government speech.  Although many were donated in completed form by private entities, the City has effectively controlled their messages by exercising final approval authority over their selection.  Johanns, supra, at 560561.  The City has selected monuments that present the image that the City wishes to project to Park visitors; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument; and it has now expressly set out selection criteria.  P.10.


(d)Respondents legitimate concern that the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints does not mean that a government entity should be required to embrace publicly a privately donated monuments message in order to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.  A city engages in expressive conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument, but it does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument.  A governments message may be altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity.  It may also change over time.  Pp. 1015.


(e)[P]ublic forum principles  are out of place in the context of this case.  United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 205.  The forum doctrine applies where a government property or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or program, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.  If governments must maintain viewpoint neutrality in selecting donated monuments, they must either prepare for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments.  Were public parks considered traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.  And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the forum, forum analysis is out of place.  Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, distinguished.  Pp.1518.

07-526|"CARCIERI, GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND, etal. v. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 07526.Argued November 3, 2008Decided February 24, 2009
The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), enacted in 1934, authorizes the Secretary of Interior, a respondent here, to acquire land and hold it in trust for the purpose of providing land for Indians, 25 U. S.C. 465, and defines Indian to include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, 479.  The Narragansett Tribe was placed under the Colony of Rhode Islands formal guardianship in 1709.  It agreed to relinquish its tribal authority and sell all but two acres of its remaining reservation land in 1880, but then began trying to regain its land and tribal status.  From 1927 to 1937, federal authorities declined to give it assistance because they considered the Tribe to be under state, not federal jurisdiction.  In a 1978 agreement settling a dispute between the Tribe and Rhode Island, the Tribe received title to 1,800 acres of land in petitioner Charlestown in exchange for relinquishing claims to state land based on aboriginal title; and it agreed that the land would be subject to state law.  The Tribe gained formal recognition from the Federal Government in 1983, and the Secretary of Interior accepted a deed of trust to the 1,800 acres in 1988.  Subsequently, a dispute arose over whether the Tribes plans to build housing on an additional 31 acres of land it had purchased complied with local regulations.  While litigation was pending, the Secretary accepted the 31-acre parcel into trust.  The Interior Board of Indian Appeals upheld that decision, and petitioners sought review. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Secretary and other officials, determining that 479s plain language defines Indian to include members of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not require a tribe to have been federally recognized on that date; and concluding that, since the Tribe is currently federally recognized and was in existence in 1934, it is a tribe under 479.  In affirming, the First Circuit found 479 ambiguous as to the meaning of now under Federal jurisdiction, applied the principles of Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843, and deferred to the Secretarys construction of the provision to allow the land to be taken into trust.
Held:Because the term now under federal jurisdiction in 479 unambiguously refers to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in 1934, and because the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Secretary does not have the authority to take the 31-acre parcel into trust.  Pp.716.
(a)When a statutes text is plain and unambiguous, United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 4, the statute must be applied according to its terms, see, e.g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359.  Here, whether the Secretary has authority to take the parcel into trust depends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a recognized Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, which, in turn, depends on whether now refers to 1998, when the Secretary accepted the parcel into trust, or 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA.  The ordinary meaning of now, as understood at the time of enactment, was at the present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.  That definition is consistent with interpretations given now by this Court both before and after the IRAs passage.  See e.g., Franklin v. United States, 216 U. S. 559, 569; Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308, 310311.  It also aligns with the words natural reading in the context of the IRA.  Furthermore, the Secretarys current interpretation is at odds with the Executive Branchs construction of 479 at the time of enactment.  The Secretarys additional arguments in support of his contention that now is ambiguous are unpersuasive.  There is also no need to consider the parties competing views on whether Congress had a policy justification for limiting the Secretarys trust authority to tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934, since Congress use of now in 479 speaks for itself and courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.  Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253254.  Pp.713.


(b)The Court rejects alternative arguments by the Secretary and his amici that rely on statutory provisions other than 479 to support the Secretarys decision to take the parcel into trust for the Narragansetts.  Pp.1315.

07-608|"UNITED STATES v. HAYES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 07608.Argued November 10, 2008Decided February 24, 2009
In 1996, Congress extended the federal Gun Control Act of 1968s prohibition on possession of a firearm by convicted felons to include persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(9).  Responding to a 911 call reporting domestic violence, police officers discovered a rifle in respondent Hayess home.  Based on this and other evidence, Hayes was charged under 922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2) with possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  The indictment identified as the predicate misdemeanor offense Hayess 1994 conviction for battery against his then-wife, in violation of West Virginia law.  Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his 1994 conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under 922(g)(9) because West Virginias generic battery law did not designate a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the offense.  When the District Court denied the motion, Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that a 922(g)(9) predicate offense must have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim.
Held:A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a 922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.  Pp.413.
(a)The definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, contained in 921(a)(33)(A), imposes two requirements.  First, the crime must have, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.  921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  Second, it must be committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  Ibid.  The definition does not, however, require the predicate-offense statute to include, as an element, the existence of that domestic relationship.  Instead, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for an offense  committed by the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.  Pp.49.


(1)As an initial matter, 921(a)(33)(A)s use of the singular word element suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element, the use of force.  Had Congress also meant to make the specified relationship a predicate-offense element, it likely would have used the plural elements, as it has done in other offense-defining provisions.  See, e.g., 18 U. S.C. 3559(c)(2)(A).  Treating the specified relationship as a predicate-offense element is also awkward as a matter of syntax.  It requires the reader to regard the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon as an expression modified by the relative clause committed by.  It is more natural, however, to say a person commit[s] an offense than to say one commit[s] a use.  Pp.56.


(2)The Fourth Circuits textual arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  First, that court noted, clause (ii) is separated from clause (i)which defines misdemeanorby a line break and a semicolon, while clause (ii)s componentsforce and domestic relationshipare joined in an unbroken word flow.  Such less-than-meticulous drafting hardly shows that Congress meant to exclude from 922(g)(9)s prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery laws.  As structured, 921(a)(33)(A) defines misdemeanor crime of domestic violence by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of misdemeanor, and in clause (ii) crime of domestic violence.  Because a crime of domestic violence involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under 921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship.  A related statutory provision, 25 U. S.C. 2803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S.C. 921(a)(33)(A).  Second, the Fourth Circuit relied on the rule of the last antecedent to read committed by as modifying the immediately preceding use-of-force phrase rather than the earlier word offense.  The last-antecedent rule, however, is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.  Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26.  Applying the rule here would require the Court to accept the unlikely premises that Congress employed the singular element to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction commi[t] a use.  The rule, moreover, would render the word committed superfluous, for Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to the use  of physical force  by a current or former spouse .  Pp.69.


(b)Practical considerations strongly support this Courts reading of 921(a)(33)(A).  By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, 922(g)(9)s proponents sought to close a loophole:Existing felon-in-possession laws often failed to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, for such offenders generally were not charged with, or convicted of, felonies.  Construing 922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would frustrate Congress manifest purpose.  The statute would have been a dead letter in some two-thirds of the States because, in 1996, only about one-third of them had criminal statutes specifically proscribing domestic violence.  Hayes argues that the measure that became 922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A), though it initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, was revised and narrowed during the legislative process, but his argument is not corroborated by the revisions he identifies.  Indeed, 922(g)(9)s Senate sponsor observed that a domestic relationship often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense.  Such remarks are not controlling, Consumer Product Safety Commn v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, but the legislative record is otherwise silent.  Pp.1012.


(c)The rule of lenity, on which Hayes also relies, applies only when a statute is ambiguous.  Section 921(a)(33)(A)s definition, though not a model of the careful drafters art, is also not grievous[ly] ambigu[ous].  Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 831.  The text, context, purpose, and what little drafting history there is all point in the same direction: Congress defined misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to include an offense committed by a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.  Pp.1213.

No. 07608.Argued November 10, 2008Decided February 24, 2009
In 1996, Congress extended the federal Gun Control Act of 1968s prohibition on possession of a firearm by convicted felons to include persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(9).  Responding to a 911 call reporting domestic violence, police officers discovered a rifle in respondent Hayess home.  Based on this and other evidence, Hayes was charged under 922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2) with possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  The indictment identified as the predicate misdemeanor offense Hayess 1994 conviction for battery against his then-wife, in violation of West Virginia law.  Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his 1994 conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under 922(g)(9) because West Virginias generic battery law did not designate a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the offense.  When the District Court denied the motion, Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that a 922(g)(9) predicate offense must have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim.
Held:A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a 922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.  Pp.413.
(a)The definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, contained in 921(a)(33)(A), imposes two requirements.  First, the crime must have, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.  921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  Second, it must be committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  Ibid.  The definition does not, however, require the predicate-offense statute to include, as an element, the existence of that domestic relationship.  Instead, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for an offense  committed by the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.  Pp.49.


(1)As an initial matter, 921(a)(33)(A)s use of the singular word element suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element, the use of force.  Had Congress also meant to make the specified relationship a predicate-offense element, it likely would have used the plural elements, as it has done in other offense-defining provisions.  See, e.g., 18 U. S.C. 3559(c)(2)(A).  Treating the specified relationship as a predicate-offense element is also awkward as a matter of syntax.  It requires the reader to regard the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon as an expression modified by the relative clause committed by.  It is more natural, however, to say a person commit[s] an offense than to say one commit[s] a use.  Pp.56.


(2)The Fourth Circuits textual arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  First, that court noted, clause (ii) is separated from clause (i)which defines misdemeanorby a line break and a semicolon, while clause (ii)s componentsforce and domestic relationshipare joined in an unbroken word flow.  Such less-than-meticulous drafting hardly shows that Congress meant to exclude from 922(g)(9)s prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery laws.  As structured, 921(a)(33)(A) defines misdemeanor crime of domestic violence by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of misdemeanor, and in clause (ii) crime of domestic violence.  Because a crime of domestic violence involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under 921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship.  A related statutory provision, 25 U. S.C. 2803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S.C. 921(a)(33)(A).  Second, the Fourth Circuit relied on the rule of the last antecedent to read committed by as modifying the immediately preceding use-of-force phrase rather than the earlier word offense.  The last-antecedent rule, however, is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.  Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26.  Applying the rule here would require the Court to accept the unlikely premises that Congress employed the singular element to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction commi[t] a use.  The rule, moreover, would render the word committed superfluous, for Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to the use  of physical force  by a current or former spouse .  Pp.69.


(b)Practical considerations strongly support this Courts reading of 921(a)(33)(A).  By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, 922(g)(9)s proponents sought to close a loophole:Existing felon-in-possession laws often failed to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, for such offenders generally were not charged with, or convicted of, felonies.  Construing 922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would frustrate Congress manifest purpose.  The statute would have been a dead letter in some two-thirds of the States because, in 1996, only about one-third of them had criminal statutes specifically proscribing domestic violence.  Hayes argues that the measure that became 922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A), though it initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, was revised and narrowed during the legislative process, but his argument is not corroborated by the revisions he identifies.  Indeed, 922(g)(9)s Senate sponsor observed that a domestic relationship often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense.  Such remarks are not controlling, Consumer Product Safety Commn v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, but the legislative record is otherwise silent.  Pp.1012.


(c)The rule of lenity, on which Hayes also relies, applies only when a statute is ambiguous.  Section 921(a)(33)(A)s definition, though not a model of the careful drafters art, is also not grievous[ly] ambigu[ous].  Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 831.  The text, context, purpose, and what little drafting history there is all point in the same direction: Congress defined misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to include an offense committed by a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.  Pp.1213.

No. 07869.Argued November 3, 2008Decided February 24, 2009
Idahos Right to Work Act permits public employees to authorize payroll deductions for general union dues, but prohibits such deductions for union political activities.  Respondentsa group of Idaho public employee unionssued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but struck it down as it applies to local governments.  In affirming, the Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their payroll deduction systems.  The court applied strict scrutiny to hold that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.  
Held:Idahos ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local governmental units, does not infringe the unions First Amendment rights.  Pp.511.
(a)Content-based restrictions on speech are presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny.  Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, ___.  The First Amendment does not, however, impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech.  See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549.  Idahos law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.  Idahos public employee unions are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.  They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.  Idahos decision to limit public employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions First Amendment rights.  The State accordingly need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban.  Idahos justification is the interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.  See, e.g., Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565.   And the States response to the problem is limited to its sourcepolitical payroll deductions.  Cf. Davenport, supra.  The ban plainly serves the States interest in separating public employment from political activities.  Pp. 58.


(b)The ban at issue is valid at the local level.  The same deferential review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local governmental entities.  Political subdivisions have never been considered sovereign entities but are instead subordinate governmental instrumentalities.  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575.  The States legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies depending on the level of government affected.  The ban furthers Idahos interest in separating the operation of government from partisan politics, and that interest extends to all public employers at whatever level of government.  Pp.911.

06-1595|"CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 061595.Argued October 8, 2008Decided January 26, 2009
In response to questions from an official of respondent local government (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual harassment by the Metro School District employee relations director (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that Hughes had sexually harassed her.  Metro took no action against Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement.  She filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughess behavior, in violation of 42 U. S.C. 2000e3(a), which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any  employe[e] who (1) has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter (opposition clause), or (2) has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter (participation clause).  The court granted Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the opposition clause demanded active, consistent opposing activities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not cover Metros internal investigation because it was not conducted pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Held:The antiretaliation provisions protection extends to an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in answering questions during an employers internal investigation.  Because oppose is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dictionary meaning of resisting or contending against.  Crawfords statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disapproving account of Hughess sexually obnoxious behavior toward her.  Oppose goes beyond active, consistent behavior in ordinary discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it.  Thus, a person can oppose by responding to someone elses questions just as surely as by provoking the discussion.  Nothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when asked a question.  Metro unconvincingly argues for the Sixth Circuits active, consistent opposition rule, claiming that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go badly for an employee who responded to enquiries.  Employers, however, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to discriminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807, hold [a]n employer  subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with  authority over the employee.  The Circuits rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along with the statutes primary objective of avoid[ing] harm to employees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting discrimination in answer to an employers questions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep quiet about Title VII offenses.  Because Crawfords conduct is covered by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.  Metros other defenses to the retaliation claim were never reached by the District Court, and thus remain open on remand.  Pp.38.

07-1059|"UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S.A. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 071059.Argued November 4, 2008 Decided January 26, 2009
Nuclear utilities generally procure their fuel, low enriched uranium (LEU), through one of two types of contracts.  Under an enriched uranium product (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the enricher cash for LEU of a desired quantity and assay, i.e., its percentage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction.  The amount of energy required to enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a separative work unit (SWU).  Under a SWU contract, the utility provides a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to produce the required LEU quantity and assay.  SWU contracts do not require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the utilitys uranium.  Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an enrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from the enrichers undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility provided.


Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium enrichment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce Department (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which calls for antidumping duties on foreign merchandise sold in this country at less than its fair value, 19 U. S.C. 1673, but does not touch international sales of services.  USEC alleged that LEU imported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was materially harming domestic industry.  In its final determination, the Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU acquired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair value.  Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in SWU contracts.  The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately reversed, noting the legal fiction expressed in SWU contracts that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility.  Finding that the record did not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership rights, the CIT reasoned that the Departments decision was unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law.  The Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT had.  
Held:The Departments take on the transactions at issue as sales of goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and application of 1673.  Because 1677(1) gives this determination to the Department in the first instance, the Departments interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language.  See, e.g., Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837.  Two threshold propositions must be accepted.  First, the Department reasonably concluded that 1673 is not limited by its terms to cash-only sales.  If that were the case, any sale of a manufactured product could be exempted from the sections operation by a contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a commodity.  Second, since public law is not constrained by private fiction, see, e.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332,  336, the Department is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility.  Thus, the test of the Departments position turns first on whether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the utility provides.  Although it is undisputed that 1673 applies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it applies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.  This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative agency for a decision about a statutes scope.  Once the choice is made, the Court asks only whether the Departments application of the statute was reasonable.  Where, as here, cash plus an untracked fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably treat the transaction as the sale of a good under 1673.  Cf. Powder Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116.  The Departments position is reinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping duties effectiveness.  It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value.  Such a transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to material injury, the very threat that 1673 was meant to counter.  But the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable.  Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in exchange for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it.  And the restructuring would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise the uncreative.  The Departments attempt to foreclose this absurd result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently reasonable.  Pp.916.

Where, as here, cash plus an untracked fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably treat the transaction as the sale of a good under 1673.  Cf. Powder Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116.  The Departments position is reinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping duties effectiveness.  It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value.  Such a transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to material injury, the very threat that 1673 was meant to counter.  But the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable.  Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in exchange for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it.  And the restructuring would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise the uncreative.  The Departments attempt to foreclose this absurd result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently reasonable.  Pp.916.

07-1122|"ARIZONA v. JOHNSON
certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona
No. 071122.Argued December 9, 2008Decided January 26, 2009
In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, this Court held that a stop and frisk may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendments ban on unreasonable searches and seizures if two conditions are met.  First, the investigatory stop (temporary detention) must be lawful, a requirement met in an on-the-street encounter when a police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a crime.  Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk (patdown for weapons), the officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.  For the duration of a traffic stop, the Court recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes everyone in the vehicle, the driver and all passengers.  Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249, 255.


While patrolling near a Tucson neighborhood associated with the Crips gang, police officers serving on Arizonas gang task force stopped an automobile for a vehicular infraction warranting a citation.  At the time of the stop, the officers had no reason to suspect the cars occupants of criminal activity.  Officer Trevizo attended to respondent Johnson, the back-seat passenger, whose behavior and clothing caused Trevizo to question him.  After learning that Johnson was from a town with a Crips gang and had been in prison, Trevizo asked him get out of the car in order to question him further, out of the hearing of the front-seat passenger, about his gang affiliation.  Because she suspected that he was armed, she patted him down for safety when he exited the car.  During the patdown, she felt the butt of a gun.  At that point, Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo handcuffed him.  Johnson was charged with, inter alia, possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that the stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.  Johnson was convicted.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.  While recognizing that Johnson was lawfully seized, the court found that, prior to the frisk, the detention had evolved into a consensual conversation about his gang affiliation.  Trevizo, the court therefore concluded, had no right to pat Johnson down even if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dangerous.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.
Held:Officer Trevizos patdown of Johnson did not violate the Fourth Amendments prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.  Pp.59.
(a) Terry established that, in an investigatory stop based on reasonably grounded suspicion of criminal activity, the police must be positioned to act instantly if they have reasonable cause to suspect that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous.  392 U. S., at 24.  Because a limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to protect both the officer and the public, a patdown is constitutional.  Id., at 2324, 27, 3031.  Traffic stops, which resemble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in Terry, Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439, n. 29, are especially fraught with danger to police officers, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1047, who may minimize the risk of harm by exercising unquestioned command of the situation, Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414.  Three decisions cumulatively portray Terrys application in a traffic-stop setting.  In Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (per curiam), the Court held that once a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment, id., at 111, n.6, because the governments legitimate and weighty interest in officer safety outweighs the de minimis additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle, id., at 110111.  Citing Terry, the Court further held that a driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver might be armed and dangerous.  434 U. S., at 112.  Wilson, 519 U. S., at 413, held that the Mimms rule applies to passengers as well as drivers, based on the same weighty interest in officer safety.  Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 263, held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is, from the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the road.  A passengers motivation to use violence during the stop to prevent apprehension for a crime more grave than a traffic violation is just as great as that of the driver.  519 U. S., at 414.  And as the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle, id., at 413414, the additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal, id., at 415.  Pp.57.


(b)The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger, but concluded that once Officer Trevizo began questioning him on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.  The court portrayed the interrogation as consensual, and, Johnson emphasizes, Trevizo testified that Johnson could have refused to exit the vehicle and to submit to the patdown.  But Trevizo also testified that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her questions or otherwise cooperate with her.  A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop.  Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave.  An officers inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the stops duration.  See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 100101.  A reasonable passenger would understand that during the time a car is lawfully stopped, he or she is not free to terminate the encounter with the police and move about at will.  Nothing occurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free to depart without police permission.  Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 257.  Trevizo was not required by the Fourth Amendment to give Johnson an opportunity to depart without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.  Pp.79.
217 Ariz. 58, 170 P.3d 667, reversed and remanded.

07-636|"KENNEDY, executrix of the ESTATE OF KENNEDY, DECEASED v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DuPONT SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 07636.Argued October 7, 2008Decided January 26, 2009
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as relevant here, obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans in accordance with the documents and instruments governing them, 29 U. S.C. 1104(a)(1)(D); requires covered pension benefit plans to provide that benefits  may not be assigned or alienated, 1056(d)(1); and exempts from this bar qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs), 1056(d)(3).  The decedent, William Kennedy, participated in his employers savings and investment plan (SIP), with power both to designate a beneficiary to receive the funds upon his death and to replace or revoke that designation as prescribed by the plan administrator.  Under the terms of the plan, if there is no surviving spouse or designated beneficiary at the time of death, distribution is made as directed by the estates executor or administrator.  Upon their marriage, William designated Liv Kennedy his SIP beneficiary and named no contingent beneficiary.  Their subsequent divorce decree divested Liv of her interest in the SIP benefits, but William did not execute a document removing Liv as the SIP beneficiary.  On Williams death, petitioner Kari Kennedy, his daughter and the executrix of his Estate, asked for the SIP funds to be distributed to the Estate, but the plan administrator relied on Williams designation form and paid them to Liv.  The Estate filed suit, alleging that Liv had waived her SIP benefits in the divorce and thus respondents, the employer and the SIP plan administrator (together, DuPont), had violated ERISA by paying her.  As relevant here, the District Court entered summary judgment for the Estate, ordering DuPont to pay the benefits to the Estate.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Livs waiver was an assignment or alienation of her interest to the Estate barred by 1056(d)(1).
Held:
1.Because Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the SIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, her waiver did not constitute an assignment or alienation rendered void under 1056(d)(1).  Pp.513.


(a)Given the legal meaning of assigned and alienated, it is fair to say that Liv did not assign or alienate anything to William or to the Estate.  The Fifth Circuits broad readingthat Livs waiver indirectly transferred her interest to the next possible beneficiary, here the Estateis questionable.  It would be odd to speak of an estate as the transferee of its own decedents property or of the decedent in his lifetime as his own transferee.  It would also be strange under the Treasury Regulation that defines assignment and alienation.  Moreover, it is difficult to see how certain waivers not barred by the antialienation provision e.g., a surviving spouses ability to waive a survivors annuity or lump-sum payment, see Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U. S. 833, 843; 29 U. S.C. 1055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2), would be permissible under the Fifth Circuits reading.  These doubts, and exceptions calling the Fifth Circuits reading into question, point the Court toward the law of trusts that serves as ERISAs backdrop.  Beck v. PACE Intl Union, 551 U. S. 96, 101.  Section 1056(d)(1) is much like a spendthrift trust provision barring assignment or alienation of a benefit, see Boggs, supra, at 852, and the cognate trust law is highly suggestive here.  The general principle that a designated spendthrift beneficiary can disclaim his trust interest magnifies the improbability that a statute written with an eye on the old law would effectively force a beneficiary to take an interest willy-nilly.  The Treasury reads its own regulation to mean that the antialienation provision is not violated by a beneficiarys waiver where the beneficiary does not attempt to direct her interest in pension benefits to another person.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18.  Being neither plainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regulation, the Treasury Departments interpretation is controlling.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  ERISAs QDRO provisions shed no light on the validity of a waiver by a non-QDRO.  Pp.511.


(b)DuPonts additional reasons for saying that ERISA barred Livs waiver are unavailing.  Pp.1113.


2.Although Livs waiver was not nullified by 1056s express terms, the plan administrator did its ERISA duty by paying the SIP benefits to Liv in conformity with the plan documents.  ERISA provides no exception to the plan administrators duty to act in accordance with plan documents.  Thus, the Estates claim stands or falls by the terms of the plan, 29 U. S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B), a straightforward rule that lets employers establish a uniform administrative scheme, [with] a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits, Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148.  By giving a plan participant a clear set of instructions for making his own instructions clear, ERISA forecloses any justification for enquiries into expressions of intent, in favor of the virtues of adhering to an uncomplicated rule.  Less certain rules could force plan administrators to examine numerous external documents purporting to be waivers and draw them into litigation like this over those waivers meaning and enforceability.  The guarantee of simplicity is not absolute, since a QDROs enforceability may require an administrator to look for beneficiaries outside plan documents notwithstanding 1104(a)(1)(D).  But an administrator enforcing a QDRO must be said to enforce plan documents, not ignore them, and a QDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given its specific and objective criteria.  These are good and sufficient reasons for holding the line, just as the Court did in holding that ERISA preempted state laws that could blur the bright-line requirement to follow plan documents in distributing benefits.  See Boggs, supra, at 850, and Egelhoff, supra, at 143.  What goes for inconsistent state law goes for a federal common law of waiver that might obscure a plan administrators duty to act in accordance with the documents and instruments.  See Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 259.  This case points out the wisdom of protecting the plan documents rule.  Under the SIP, Liv was Williams designated beneficiary.  The plan provided a way to disclaim an interest in the SIP account, which Liv did not purport to follow.  The plan administrator therefore did exactly what 1104(a)(1)(D) required and paid Liv the benefits.  Pp.1318.
497 F.3d 426, affirmed.

07-854|"VAN de KAMP etal. v. GOLDSTEIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07854.Argued November 5, 2008Decided January 26, 2009
Respondent Goldstein was released from a California prison after he filed a successful federal habeas petition alleging that his murder conviction depended, in critical part, on the false testimony of a jailhouse informant (Fink), who had received reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that prosecutors knew, but failed to give his attorney, this potential impeachment information; and that, among other things, that failure had led to his erroneous conviction.  Once released, Goldstein filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, asserting the prosecution violated its constitutional duty to communicate impeachment information, see Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154, due to the failure of petitioners, supervisory prosecutors, to properly train or supervise prosecutors or to establish an information system containing potential impeachment material about informants.  Claiming absolute immunity, petitioners asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint, but the court declined, finding that the conduct was administrative, not prosecutorial, and hence fell outside the scope of an absolute immunity claim.  The Ninth Circuit, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.
Held:Petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldsteins supervision, training, and information-system management claims.  Pp.312. 
(a)Prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in 1983 suits brought against prosecutorial actions that are intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 428, 430, because of concern that harassment by unfounded litigation could both cause a deflection of the prosecutors energies from his public duties and lead him to shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust, id., at 423.  However, absolute immunity may not apply when a prosecutor is not acting as an officer of the court, but is instead engaged in, say, investigative or administrative tasks.  Id., at 431, n. 33.  To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular prosecutorial activity, one must take account of Imblers functional considerations.  The fact that one constitutional duty in Imbler was positive (the duty to supply information relevant to the defense) rather than negative (the duty not to use  perjured testimony) was not critical to the finding of absolute immunity.  Pp.36.


(b)Although Goldstein challenges administrative procedures, they are procedures that are directly connected with a trials conduct.  A prosecutors error in a specific criminal trial constitutes an essential element of the plaintiffs claim.  The obligations here are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, e.g., workplace hiring.  Moreover, they necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion, e.g., in determining what information should be included in training, supervision, or information-system management.  Given these features, absolute immunity must follow.  Pp.612.


(1)Had Goldstein brought a suit directly attacking supervisory prosecutors actions related to an individual trial, instead of one involving administration, all the prosecutors would have enjoyed absolute immunity under Imbler.  Their behavior, individually or separately, would have involved [p]reparation  for  trial, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33, and would have been intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, id., at 430.  The only difference between Imbler and the hypothetical, i.e., that a supervisor or colleague might be liable instead of the trial prosecutor, is not critical.  Pp.78.


(2)Just as supervisory prosecutors are immune in a suit directly attacking their actions in an individual trial, they are immune here.  The fact that the offices general supervision and training methods are at issue is not a critical difference for present purposes.  The relevant management tasks concern how and when to make impeachment information available at trial, and, thus, are directly connected with a prosecutors basic trial advocacy duties.  In terms of Imblers functional concerns, a suit claiming that a supervisor made a mistake directly related to a particular trial and one claiming that a supervisor trained and supervised inadequately seem very much alike.  The type of faulty training claim here rests in part on a consequent error by an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial.  If, as Imbler says, the threat of damages liability for such an error could lead a trial prosecutor to take account of that risk when making trial-related decisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread liability throughout the office lead both that prosecutor and other office prosecutors to take account of such a risk.  Because better training or supervision might prevent most prosecutorial errors at trial, permission to bring suit here would grant criminal defendants permission to bring claims for other trial-related training or supervisory failings.  Further, such suits could pose substantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor.  Imbler, 425 U. S., at 425.  And defending prosecutorial decisions, often years later, could impose unique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.  Id., at 425426.  Permitting this suit to go forward would also create practical anomalies.  A trial prosecutor would remain immune for intentional misconduct, while her supervisor might be liable for negligent training or supervision.  And the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charging trial failure to one charging a training or supervision failure would eviscerate Imbler.  Pp.811.


(3)The differences between an information management system and training or supervision do not require a different outcome, for the critical element of any information system is the information it contains.  Deciding what to include and what not to include is little different from making similar decisions regarding training, for it requires knowledge of the law.  Moreover, were this claim allowed, a court would have to review the offices legal judgments, not simply about whether to have an information system but also about what kind of system is appropriate, and whether an appropriate system would have included Giglio-related information about one particular kind of informant.  Such decisionswhether made before or during trialare intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, Imbler, supra, at 430, and all Imblers functional considerations apply.

			"|"VAN de KAMP etal. v. GOLDSTEIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07854.Argued November 5, 2008Decided January 26, 2009
Respondent Goldstein was released from a California prison after he filed a successful federal habeas petition alleging that his murder conviction depended, in critical part, on the false testimony of a jailhouse informant (Fink), who had received reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that prosecutors knew, but failed to give his attorney, this potential impeachment information; and that, among other things, that failure had led to his erroneous conviction.  Once released, Goldstein filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, asserting the prosecution violated its constitutional duty to communicate impeachment information, see Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154, due to the failure of petitioners, supervisory prosecutors, to properly train or supervise prosecutors or to establish an information system containing potential impeachment material about informants.  Claiming absolute immunity, petitioners asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint, but the court declined, finding that the conduct was administrative, not prosecutorial, and hence fell outside the scope of an absolute immunity claim.  The Ninth Circuit, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.
Held:Petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldsteins supervision, training, and information-system management claims.  Pp.312. 
(a)Prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in 1983 suits brought against prosecutorial actions that are intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 428, 430, because of concern that harassment by unfounded litigation could both cause a deflection of the prosecutors energies from his public duties and lead him to shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust, id., at 423.  However, absolute immunity may not apply when a prosecutor is not acting as an officer of the court, but is instead engaged in, say, investigative or administrative tasks.  Id., at 431, n. 33.  To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular prosecutorial activity, one must take account of Imblers functional considerations.  The fact that one constitutional duty in Imbler was positive (the duty to supply information relevant to the defense) rather than negative (the duty not to use  perjured testimony) was not critical to the finding of absolute immunity.  Pp.36.


(b)Although Goldstein challenges administrative procedures, they are procedures that are directly connected with a trials conduct.  A prosecutors error in a specific criminal trial constitutes an essential element of the plaintiffs claim.  The obligations here are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, e.g., workplace hiring.  Moreover, they necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion, e.g., in determining what information should be included in training, supervision, or information-system management.  Given these features, absolute immunity must follow.  Pp.612.


(1)Had Goldstein brought a suit directly attacking supervisory prosecutors actions related to an individual trial, instead of one involving administration, all the prosecutors would have enjoyed absolute immunity under Imbler.  Their behavior, individually or separately, would have involved [p]reparation  for  trial, 424 U.

The fact that the offices general supervision and training methods are at issue is not a critical difference for present purposes.  The relevant management tasks concern how and when to make impeachment information available at trial, and, thus, are directly connected with a prosecutors basic trial advocacy duties.

08-5657|"LAWRENCE W. NELSON, aka ZIKEE v.
UNITED STATES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 085657.Decided January 26, 2009
Per Curiam.

Lawrence Nelson was convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base.  See 21 U. S.C. 846.  The District Court calculated Nelsons sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and imposed a sentence of 360 months in prison (the bottom of the range).  During sentencing, the judge explained that under Fourth Circuit precedent, the Guidelines are considered presumptively reasonable, so that unless theres a good reason in the [statutory sentencing] fac-
tors , the Guideline sentence is the reasonable sentence.  Pet. for Cert. 10.


The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed Nelsons conviction and sentence.  United States v. Nelson, 237 Fed. Appx. 819 (2007) (per curiam).  It noted that within-Guidelines sentences are presumptively reasonable, and rejected Nelsons argument that the District Courts reliance on that presumption was error.  Id., at 821.


Nelson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.  We granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338 (2007).  Nelson v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).


On remand and without further briefing, the Fourth Circuit again affirmed the sentence.  276 Fed. Appx. 331 (2008) (per curiam).  The court acknowledged that under Rita, while courts of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines, 551 U. S., at 347, the sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply, id., at 351.  Instead, the sentencing court must first calculate the Guidelines range, and then consider what sentence is appropriate for the individual defendant in light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U. S.C. 3553(a), explaining any variance from the former with reference to the latter.  Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit upheld the sentence, finding that the District Court did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory but rather understood that they were only advisory.  276 Fed. Appx., at 333.


Nelson has again filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, reasserting, inter alia, essentially the same argument he made before us the first time: that the District Courts statements clearly indicate that it impermissibly applied a presumption of reasonableness to his Guidelines range.  The United States admits that the Fourth Circuit erred in rejecting that argument following our remand; we agree.


Our cases do not allow a sentencing court to presume that a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is reasonable.  In Rita we said as much, in fairly explicit terms: We repeat that the presumption before us is an appellate court presumption. . . .  [T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.  551 U. S., at 351.  And in Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), we reiterated that district judges, in considering how the various statutory sentencing factors apply to an individual defendant, may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1112).


In this case, the Court of Appeals quoted the above language from Rita but affirmed the sentence anyway after finding that the District Judge did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory.  That is true, but beside the point.  The Guidelines are not only not mandatory on sentencing courts; they are also not to be presumed reasonable.  We think it plain from the comments of the sentencing judge that he did apply a presumption of reasonableness to Nelsons Guidelines range.  Under our recent precedents, that constitutes error.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

07-1125|"FITZGERALD et vir v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL
COMMITTEE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 071125.Argued December 2, 2008Decided January 21, 2009
Petitioners filed suit against respondents, the local school districts governing board and superintendent, alleging that their response to allegations of sexual harassment of petitioners daughter by an older student was inadequate, raising claims under, inter alia, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.C. 1681(a), and 42 U. S.C. 1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Among its rulings, the District Court dismissed the 1983 claim.  The First Circuit affirmed, holding that, under this Courts precedents, Title IXs implied private remedy was sufficiently comprehensive to preclude the use of 1983 to advance constitutional claims.  
Held: 
1.Title IX does not preclude a 1983 action alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools.  Pp.412.


(a)In Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992; and Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, this Court found that particular statutory enactments precluded 1983 claims where it was established that Congress intended the statutes remedial scheme to be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert [such] claims, Smith, supra, at 1009.  In determining whether Congress intended for a subsequent statute to preclude the enforcement of a federal right under 1983, the Court has placed primary emphasis on the nature and extent of that statutes remedial scheme.  See Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 20.  Where the 1983 claim alleges a constitutional violation, a lack of congressional intent to preclude may also be inferred from a comparison of the rights and protections of the other statute and those existing under the Constitution.  Pp.47. 


(b)In the absence of a comprehensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes, and in light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, it must be concluded that Title IX was not meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimination in schools, or a substitute for 1983 suits as a means of enforcing constitutional rights.  Pp.712.


(i)Title IXs only express enforcement mechanism, 20 U. S.C. 1682, is an administrative procedure resulting in the withdrawal of federal funding from noncompliant institutions.  This Court has also recognized an implied private right of action, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717, for which both injunctive relief and damages are available, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 76.  These remedies stand in stark contrast to the unusually elaborate, carefully tailored, and restrictive enforcement schemes of the statutes in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes.  Unlike those statutes, Title IX has no administrative exhaustion requirement and no notice provisions.  Plaintiffs can file directly in court under its implied private right of action and can obtain the full range of remedies.  Accordingly, parallel and concurrent 1983 claims will neither circumvent required procedures nor allow access to new remedies.  Moreover, under Rancho Palos Verdes, [t]he provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself is a key consideration in determining congressional intent, and the existence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations has been the dividing line between those cases in which  an action would lie under 1983 and those in which we have held that it would not.  544 U. S., at 121.  Title IX contains no express private remedy, much less a more restrictive one.  Pp.79. 


(ii)Because Title IXs protections are narrower in some respects and broader in others than those guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court cannot agree with the First Circuit that Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of correcting unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools.  Title IX reaches institutions and programs that receive federal funds, 20 U. S.C. 1681(a), which may include nonpublic institutions, 1681(c), but it has consistently been interpreted as not authorizing suit against school officials, teachers, and other individuals.  Moreover, while the constitutional provision reaches only state actors, 1983 equal protection claims may be brought against individuals as well as state entities.  West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 4851.  And Title IX exempts from its restrictions several activities that may be challenged on constitutional grounds.  See, e.g., 1681(a)(5).  Even where particular activities and particular defendants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, the standards for establishing liability may not be wholly congruent.  Compare Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 290, with Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694.  Pp.911. 


(iii)The Courts conclusion is consistent with Title IXs context and history.  Because the Congress that enacted Title IX authorized the Attorney General to intervene in private suits alleging sex discrimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause, 42 U. S.C. 2000h2, Congress must have explicitly envisioned that private plaintiffs would bring constitutional claims to challenge gender discrimination via 1983.  Moreover, Title IX was modeled after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Cannon, supra, at 694695, and, at the time of Title IXs 1972 enactment, the lower courts routinely interpreted Title VI to allow for parallel and concurrent 1983 claims.  Absent contrary evidence, it follows that Congress intended Title IX to be interpreted similarly to allow for parallel and concurrent 1983 claims.  Pp.1112.


2.As neither of the courts below addressed the merits of petitioners constitutional claims or even the sufficiency of their pleadings, this Court will not do so in the first instance here.  Pp.1213. 
504 F.3d 165, reversed and remanded.

07-610|"LOCKE et al. v. KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 07610.Argued October 6, 2008Decided January 21, 2009
The collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay the local a service fee equal to the portion of union dues related to ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or contract administration activities.  That fee does not include nonchargeable union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying activities.  The fee includes a charge that represents the affiliation fee the local pays to the national union.  But, it covers only the part of the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the nationals own chargeable activities, which include some litigation activities that directly benefit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming, inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not directly benefit the local, i.e., national litigation.  The District Court found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.  The First Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Under this Courts precedent, the First Amendment permits a local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political activities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the nationals resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing local if and when it takes place.  Pp.413.
(a)Prior decisions frame the question at issue.  The Court has long held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their continued employment.  With respect to litigation expenses, the Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, including litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses not having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting employees.  Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 453.  Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a locals payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local may charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct benefit of the objecting employees bargaining unit.  Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524.  The Court added that the local unit need not demonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the dissenting employees unit, although there must be some indication that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.  Ibid.  However, the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the subject here at issue, payment for national litigation.  Pp.49. 


(b)Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the matter.  Having examined the question further, however, the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant standards for charging other national expenditures that the Lehnert majority enunciated.  Under those standards, a local may charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a nationals litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the arrangement is reciprocalthat is, the locals payment to the national affiliate is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.  500 U. S., at 524.  Logic suggests that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant difference between litigation activities and other national activities, the cost of which this Court has found chargeable.  The petitioners arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp.911. 


(c)Applying Lehnerts standard to the national litigation expenses at issue demonstrates that they are both appropriately related to collective bargaining activities and reciprocal, and are therefore chargeable.  First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other matters that the courts have held chargeable.  No one here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.  See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519.  Second, although the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or extraunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are for services that may ultimately inure to local members benefit by virtue of their membership in the national union.  Ibid.  Respondent local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general access to the nationals financial resourcescompiled via contributions from various localswhich would not otherwise be available to the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce the locals collective-bargaining agreements.

			"|"LOCKE et al. v. KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 07610.Argued October 6, 2008Decided January 21, 2009
The collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay the local a service fee equal to the portion of union dues related to ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or contract administration activities.  That fee does not include nonchargeable union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying activities.  The fee includes a charge that represents the affiliation fee the local pays to the national union.  But, it covers only the part of the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the nationals own chargeable activities, which include some litigation activities that directly benefit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming, inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not directly benefit the local, i.e., national litigation.  The District Court found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.  The First Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Under this Courts precedent, the First Amendment permits a local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political activities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the nationals resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing local if and when it takes place.  Pp.413.
(a)Prior decisions frame the question at issue.  The Court has long held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their continued employment.  With respect to litigation expenses, the Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, including litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses not having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting employees.  Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 453.  Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a locals payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local may charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct benefit of the objecting employees bargaining unit.  Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524.  The Court added that the local unit need not demonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the dissenting employees unit, although there must be some indication that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.  Ibid.  However, the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the subject here at issue, payment for national litigation.  Pp.49. 


(b)Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the matter.  Having examined the question further, however, the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant standards for charging other national expenditures that the Lehnert majority enunciated.  Under those standards, a local may charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a nationals litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the arrangement is reciprocalthat is, the locals payment to the national affiliate is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.  500 U. S., at 524.  Logic suggests that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant difference between litigation activities and other national activities, the cost of which this Court has found chargeable.  The petitioners arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp.911. 


(c)Applying Lehnerts standard to the national litigation expenses at issue demonstrates that they are both appropriately related to collective bargaining activities and reciprocal, and are therefore chargeable.  First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other matters that the courts have held chargeable.  No one here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.  See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519.  Second, although the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or extraunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are for services that may ultimately inure to local members benefit by virtue of their membership in the national union.  Ibid.  Respondent local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general access to the nationals financial resourcescompiled via contributions from various localswhich would not otherwise be available to the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce the locals collective-bargaining agreements.  Because no one claims that the national would treat respondent local any differently from other locals in this regard, the existence of reciprocity is not in dispute.  Pp.1113. 
498 F.3d 49, affirmed.

07-751|"PEARSON etal. v. CALLAHAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 07751.Argued October 14, 2008Decided January 21, 2009
After the Utah Court of Appeals vacated respondents conviction for possession and distribution of drugs, which he sold to an undercover informant he had voluntarily admitted into his house, he brought this 42 U. S.C. 1983 damages action in federal court, alleging that petitioners, the officers who supervised and conducted the warrantless search of the premises that led to his arrest after the sale, had violated the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the officers.  Noting that other courts had adopted the consent-once-removed doctrinewhich permits a warrantless police entry into a home when consent to enter has already been granted to an undercover officer who has observed contraband in plain viewthe court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they could reasonably have believed that the doctrine authorized their conduct.  Following the procedure mandated in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, the Tenth Circuit held that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity.  The court disapproved broadening the consent-once-removed doctrine to situations in which the person granted initial consent was not an undercover officer, but merely an informant.  It further held that the Fourth Amendment right to be free in ones home from unreasonable searches and arrests was clearly established at the time of respondents arrest, and determined that, under this Courts clearly established precedents, warrantless entries into a home are per se unreasonable unless they satisfy one of the two established exceptions for consent and exigent circumstances.  The court concluded that petitioners could not reasonably have believed that their conduct was lawful because they knew that (1) they had no warrant; (2) respondent had not consented to their entry; and (3) his consent to the entry of an informant could not reasonably be interpreted to extend to them.  In granting certiorari, this Court directed the parties to address whether Saucier should be overruled in light of widespread criticism directed at it.
Held:
1.The Saucier procedure should not be regarded as an inflexible requirement.  Pp.519.


(a)Saucier mandated, see 533 U. S., at 194, a two-step sequence for resolving government officials qualified immunity claims: A court must decide (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the defendants alleged misconduct, id., at 201.  Qualified immunity applies unless the official's conduct violated such a right.  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640.  Pp.57. 


(b)Stare decisis does not prevent this Court from determining whether the Saucier procedure should be modified or abandoned.  Revisiting precedent is particularly appropriate where, as here, a departure would not upset settled expectations, see, e.g., United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521; the precedent consists of a rule that is judge-made and adopted to improve court operations, not a statute promulgated by Congress, see, e.g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20; and the precedent has been questioned by Members of th[is] Court in later decisions, and [has] defied consistent application by the lower courts, Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 829830.  Respondents argument that Saucier should not be reconsidered unless the Court concludes that it was badly reasoned or that its rule has proved unworkable, see Payne, supra, at 827, is rejected.  Those standards are out of place in the present context, where a considerable body of new experience supports a determination that a mandatory, two-step rule for resolving all qualified immunity claims should not be retained.  Pp.710. 


(c)Reconsideration of the Saucier procedure demonstrates that, while the sequence set forth therein is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory in all cases.  Pp.1019.


(i)The Court continues to recognize that the Saucier protocol is often beneficial.  In some cases, a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law may make it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all.  And Saucier was correct in noting that the two-step procedure promotes the development of constitutional precedent and is especially valuable for questions that do not frequently arise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is unavailable.  See 533 U. S., at 194.  Pp.1011. 


(ii)Nevertheless, experience in this Court and the lower federal courts has pointed out the rigid Saucier procedures shortcomings.  For example, it may result in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the cases outcome, and waste the parties resources by forcing them to assume the costs of litigating constitutional questions and endure delays attributable to resolving those questions when the suit otherwise could be disposed of more readily.  Moreover, although the procedures first prong is intended to further the development of constitutional precedent, opinions following that procedure often fail to make a meaningful contribution to such development, as where, e.g., a court of appeals decision is issued in an opinion marked as not precedential.  Further, when qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage, the answer to whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.  And the first step may create a risk of bad decisionmaking, as where the briefing of constitutional questions is woefully inadequate.  Application of the Saucier rule also may make it hard for affected parties to obtain appellate review of constitutional decisions having a serious prospective effect on their operations.  For example, where a court holds that a defendant has committed a constitutional violation, but then holds that the violation was not clearly established, the defendant, as the winning party, may have his right to appeal the adverse constitutional holding challenged.  Because rigid adherence to Saucier departs from the general rule of constitutional avoidance, cf., e.g., Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 388, the Court may appropriately decline to mandate the order of decision that the lower courts must follow, see, e.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697.  This flexibility properly reflects the Courts respect for the lower federal courts.  Because the two-step Saucier procedure is often, but not always, advantageous, those judges are in the best position to determine the order of decisionmaking that will best facilitate the fair and efficient disposition of each case.  Pp.1117.  


(iii)Misgivings concerning todays decision are unwarranted.  It does not prevent the lower courts from following Saucier; it simply recognizes that they should have the discretion to decide whether that procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.  Moreover, it will not retard the development of constitutional law, result in a proliferation of damages claims against local governments, or spawn new litigation over the standards for deciding whether to reach the particular cases merits.  Pp.1719. 


2.Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of the search that their conduct was unconstitutional.  When the entry occurred, the consent-once-removed doctrine had been accepted by two State Supreme Courts and three Federal Courts of Appeals, and not one of the latter had issued a contrary decision.  Petitioners were entitled to rely on these cases, even though their own Federal Circuit had not yet ruled on consent-once-removed entries.  See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 618.  Pp.  1920. 
494 F.3d 891, reversed.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

07-772|"WADDINGTON, SUPERINTENDENT, WASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER v. SARAUSAD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07772.Argued October 15, 2008Decided January 21, 2009
Respondent Sarausad drove the car in a driveby shooting at a high school, which was the culmination of a gang dispute.  En route to school, Ronquillo, the front seat passenger, covered his lower face and readied a handgun.  Sarausad abruptly slowed down upon reaching the school, Ronquillo fired at a group of students, killing one and wounding another, and Sarausad then sped away.  He, Ronquillo, and Reyes, another passenger, were tried on murder and related charges.  Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued that they were not accomplices to murder because they had not known Ronquillos plan and had expected at most another fistfight.  In her closing argument, the prosecutor stressed Sarausads knowledge of a shooting, noting how he drove at the scene, that he knew that fighting alone would not regain respect for his gang, and that he was in for a dime, in for a dollar.  The jury received two instructions that directly quoted Washingtons accomplice-liability law.  When it failed to reach a verdict as to Reyes, the judge declared a mistrial as to him.  The jury then convicted Ronquillo on all counts and convicted Sarausad of second-degree murder and related crimes.  In affirming Sarausads conviction, the State Court of Appeals, among other things, referred to an in for a dime, in for a dollar accomplice-liability theory.  The State Supreme Court denied review, but in its subsequent Roberts case, it clarified that in for a dime, in for a dollar was not the best descriptor of accomplice liability because an accomplice must have knowledge of the crime that occurred.  The court also explicitly reaffirmed its precedent that the type of jury instructions used at Sarausads trial comport with Washington law.  Sarausad sought state postconviction relief, arguing that the prosecutors improper in for a dime, in for a dollar argument may have led the jury to convict him as an accomplice to murder based solely on a finding that he had anticipated that an assault would occur.  The state appeals court reexamined the trial record in light of Roberts, but found no error requiring correction.  The State Supreme Court denied Sarausads petition, holding that the trial court correctly instructed the jury and that no prejudicial error resulted from the prosecutors potentially improper hypothetical.  Sarausad then sought review under 28 U. S.C. 2254, which, inter alia, permits a federal court to grant habeas relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by this Court, 2254(d)(1).  The District Court granted the petition, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding it unreasonable for the state court to affirm Sarausads conviction because the jury instruction on accomplice liability was ambiguous and there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury misinterpreted the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving Sarausads knowledge of a shooting beyond a reasonable doubt.
Held:Because the state-court decision did not result in an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, 2254(d)(1), the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief to Sarausad.  Pp.1017.
(a)When a state courts application of governing federal law is challenged, the decision must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.  Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U. S. 433, 436 (per curiam).  A defendant challenging the constitutionality of a jury instruction that quotes a state statute must show both that the instruction was ambiguous and that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72.  The instruction must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record, ibid., and the pertinent question is whether the instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process, ibid.  Pp.1011.


(b)Because the Washington courts conclusion that the jury instruction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the Ninth Circuit should have ended its 2254(d)(1) inquiry there.  The instruction parroted the state statutes language, requiring the jury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice in the commission of the [murder] if he acted with knowledge that [his conduct would] promote or facilitate the commission of the [murder], Wash. Rev. Code 9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a).  The instruction cannot be assigned any meaning different from the one given to it by the Washington courts.  Pp.1112.


(c)Even if the instruction were ambiguous, the Ninth Circuit still erred in finding it so ambiguous as to cause a federal constitutional violation requiring reversal under AEDPA.  The Washington courts reasonably applied this Courts precedent when they found no reasonable likelihood that the prosecutors closing argument caused the jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facilitating a driveby shooting.  She never argued that the admission by Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a fight was a concession of accomplice liability for murder.  Sarausads attorney also homed in on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence showing that Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facilitate a premeditated murder.  Every state and federal appellate court that reviewed the verdict found the evidence supporting Sarausads knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Washington law.  Given the strength of that evidence, and the jurys failure to convict Reyeswho had also been charged as an accomplice to murder and admitted knowledge of a possible fightit was not objectively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted Sarausad because it believed that he, unlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.  The Ninth Circuits contrary reasoning is unconvincing.  Pp.1317.
479 F.3d 671, reversed and remanded.

The Washington courts reasonably applied this Courts precedent when they found no reasonable likelihood that the prosecutors closing argument caused the jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facilitating a driveby shooting.  She never argued that the admission by Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a fight was a concession of accomplice liability for murder.  Sarausads attorney also homed in on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence showing that Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facilitate a premeditated murder.  Every state and federal appellate court that reviewed the verdict found the evidence supporting Sarausads knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Washington law.  Given the strength of that evidence, and the jurys failure to convict Reyeswho had also been charged as an accomplice to murder and admitted knowledge of a possible fightit was not objectively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted Sarausad because it believed that he, unlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.  The Ninth Circuits contrary reasoning is unconvincing.  Pp.1317.

08-5721|"STEVEN SPEARS v. UNITED STATES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 085721.Decided January 21, 2009
Per Curiam.

Steven Spears was found guilty of conspiracy to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base and at least 500 grams of powder cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S.C. 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), 846.  At sentencing, the District Court determined that the drug quantities attributable to Spears yielded an offense level of 38, that his criminal history justified placing him in the Guidelines criminal history category IV, and that the resulting advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 324 to 405 months imprisonment.  The District Court was of the view that the Guidelines 100:1 ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine quantities, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2006) (USSG),* yielded an excessive sentence in light of the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U. S.C. 3553(a).  Relying in part on decisions from other District Courts, see United States v. Perry, 389 F.Supp. 2d 278, 307308 (RI 2005); United States v. Smith, 359 F.Supp. 2d 771, 781782 (ED Wis. 2005), which in turn relied on a report from the Sentencing Commission criticizing the 100:1 ratio, see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 106107, App. A, pp.36 (May 2002) (hereinafter Report to Congress), the District Court recalculated Spears offense level based on a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio.  That yielded an offense level of 34 and a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months imprisonment.  The District Court sentenced Spears to 240 months in prison, the statutory mandatory minimum.  See United States v. Spears, 469 F.3d 1166, 11731174 (CA8 2006) (en banc) (Spears I).


On cross-appeal, the Government argued that the district court erred by categorically rejecting the 100:1 quantity ratio and substituting its own ratio in calculating Spearss sentence.  Id., at 1174.  The Eighth Circuit reversed Spears sentence and remanded for resentencing, holding that neither Booker nor 3553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the 100:1 quantity ratio and use a different ratio in sentencing defendants for crack cocaine offenses.  Id., at 1176.  This Court vacated the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and remanded for further consideration in light of Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).  Spears v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).


On remand, the Eighth Circuit again reversed Spears sentence and remanded for resentencing.  533 F.3d 715, 716 (2008) (en banc) (Spears II).  It concluded, again, that the District Court may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines, id., at 717, and impermissibly varied by replacing the 100:1 quantity ratio inherent in the advisory Guidelines range with a 20:1 quantity ratio, ibid. (quoting Spears I, supra, at 1178).  Spears again petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  Because the Eighth Circuits decision on remand conflicts with our decision in Kimbrough, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.


In Kimbrough, we held that under Booker, the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and that it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve 3553(a)s purpose, even in a mine-run case, id., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (emphasis added).  The correct interpretation of that holding is the one offered by the dissent in Spears II:
The Court thus established that even when a particular defendant in a crack cocaine case presents no special mitigating circumstancesno outstanding service to country or community, no unusually disadvantaged childhood, no overstated criminal history score, no post-offense rehabilitationa sentencing court may nonetheless vary downward from the advisory guideline range.  The court may do so based solely on its view that the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentencing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine creates an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of 3553(a), and is at odds with 3553(a).  The only fact necessary to justify such a variance is the sentencing courts disagreement with the guidelinesits policy view that the 100-to-1 ratio creates an unwarranted disparity.  533 F.3d, at 719 (opinion of Colloton, J.) (citations omitted).

Kimbrough considered and rejected the position taken by the Eighth Circuit below.  It noted that a district courts decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2021) (quoting Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 351 (2007)).  The implication was that an inside the heartland departure (which is necessarily based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines and necessarily disagrees on a categorical basis) may be entitled to less respect.  Our opinion said, however, that the crack cocaine Guidelines  present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commissions exercise of its characteristic institutional role.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  Kimbrough thus holds that with respect to the crack cocaine Guidelines, a categorical disagreement with and variance from the Guidelines is not suspect.


That was indeed the point of Kimbrough: a recognition of district courts authority to vary from the crack cocaine Guidelines based on policy disagreement with them, and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.  The latter proposition was already established pre-Kimbrough, see United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 245246 (2005), and the Government conceded as much in Kimbrough.  552 U. S., at ___, n.13 (slip op., at 13, n.13).  That the Government did not prevail in Kimbrough proves that its concessionthat a district court may vary from the 100:1 ratio if it does so based on the individualized circumstance[s] of a particular case, ibid.understated the extent of district courts sentencing discretion. 


In drawing a distinction between individualized, case-specific consideration of the Guidelines ratio and categorical rejection and replacement of that ratio, the Eighth Circuit relied in part, Spears II, supra, at 717, on the following passage from Kimbrough: 
The [district] court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own.  Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with 3553(a)s overarching instruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in 3553(a)(2).  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).

This says that it was appropriate for the District Court in Kimbrough not to specify what ratio it was using, but merely to proceed with 3553(a) analysis.  The Eighth Circuit read that to mean that district courts, in the course of their individualized determinations, may not categorically disagree with the Guidelines ratio, and (consequently) may not substitute their own ratio for that of the Guidelines.  If it meant that, our vacating of the Eighth Circuits judgment in Spears I would have been inexplicable, because that supposedly impermissible disagreement and substitution was precisely the reason for Spears Is reversal of the District Court.  See Spears I, 469 F.3d, at 11751176.  As a logical matter, of course, rejection of the 100:1 ratio, explicitly approved by Kimbrough, necessarily implies adoption of some other ratio to govern the mine-run case.  A sentencing judge who is given the power to reject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ratio must also possess the power to apply a different ratio which, in his judgment, corrects the disparity.  Put simply, the ability to reduce a mine-run defendants sentence necessarily permits adoption of a replacement ratio.  


To the extent the above quoted language has obscured Kimbroughs holding, we now clarify that district courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the crack-cocaine Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those Guidelines.  Here, the District Courts choice of replacement ratio was based upon two well-reasoned decisions by other courts, which themselves reflected the Sentencing Commissions expert judgment that a 20:1 ratio would be appropriate in a mine-run case.  See Perry, 389 F.Supp. 2d, at 307308; Smith, 359 F.Supp. 2d, at 781782; Report to Congress 106107, App. A, pp.36.


The alternative approachadopted by the Eighth Circuitwould likely yield one of two results.  Either district courts would treat the Guidelines policy embodied in the crack-to-powder ratio as mandatory, believing that they are not entitled to vary based on categorical policy disagreements with the Guidelines, or they would continue to vary, masking their categorical policy disagreements as individualized determinations.  The latter is institutionalized subterfuge.  The former contradicts our holding in Kimbrough.  Neither is an acceptable sentencing practice.


In opposing Spears present petition for a writ of certiorari, the Government contends that the Eighth Circuits opinion stands only for the noncontroversial proposition that a remand for resentencing was warranted in this case because the District Court did not properly consider all of the 3553(a) sentencing factors.  Brief in Opposition 1213.  But the Government did not present that argument below, and the Eighth Circuits opinion plainly did not rest on that ground.  It concluded instead that the district court may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines.  Spears II, 533 F.3d, at 717.  The Eighth Circuit has since read its own opinion to mean what it says, see United States v. Judon, 284 Fed. Appx. 371, 372 (2008) (per curiam), and so do we.  In any event, to the extent the District Court cut short its sentencing analysis, it did so only because it had already determined that a mandatory minimum sentence was required, thus mooting any further arguments for a reduced sentence.  The decision not to entertain pointless arguments hardly constitutes procedural error.


The dissent contends, post, at 1, that the Eighth Circuit recognized Kimbroughs core holding when it stated that in conducting an individualized assessment based upon the particular circumstances of a defendants case, a district court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than necessary,  Spears II, supra, at 717.  But that was not Kimbroughs holding; it was the Governments position in Kimbrough, which did not prevail.  And it is expressly contradicted by Kimbroughs holding that district courts are entitled to vary from the crack-cocaine guidelines in a mine-run case where there are no particular circumstances that would otherwise justify a variance from the Guidelines sentencing range.


The dissent believes that [t]his petition involves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts that do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may adopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in place of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.  Post, at 1.  But that is in fact not distinct from the issue we addressed in Kimbrough.  To say that the judge who considers the 100:1 ratio excessive cannot apply a different ratio is to say that the Kimbrough-sanctioned district-court disagreement with the 100:1 ratio cannot honestly be given effect.  It is absurd to think that a sentence which is reasonable in light of the statutory sentencing factors, see 18 U. S.C. 3553(a), becomes unreasonable if the sentencing judge chooses to specify his disagreement, and the degree of his disagreement, with the 100:1 ratio, which is the entire basis for his Guidelines departure.


The dissent says that Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough have given the lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively short period.  Post, at 3.  True enoughand we should therefore promptly remove from the menu the Eighth Circuits offering, a smuggled-in dish that is indigestible.  Finally, the dissent points out that other courts have followed the Eighth Circuits course, see United States v. Russell, 537 F.3d 6, 11 (CA1 2008); United States v. Gunter, 527 F.3d 282, 286 (CA3 2008).  Both of those courts, like the Eighth Circuit, seized upon the language from Kimbrough quoted above in order to stand by the course they had adopted pre-Kimbroughand in the case of the First Circuit, despite this Courts having vacated and remanded, in light of Kimbrough, the prior First Circuit judgment which had established that course.  See Pho v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  If the error of those opinions is, as we think, evident, they demonstrate the need to clarify at once the holding of Kimbrough.
***

The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and set the case for oral argument.


Justice Thomas dissents.
*The Sentencing Commission has since reduced the crack-to-powder ratio.  See USSG, Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (Nov. 2007).

07-513|"HERRING v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 07513.Argued October 7, 2008Decided January 14, 2009
Officers in Coffee County arrested petitioner Herring based on a warrant listed in neighboring Dale Countys database.  A search incident to that arrest yielded drugs and a gun.  It was then revealed that the warrant had been recalled months earlier, though this information had never been entered into the database.  Herring was indicted on federal gun and drug possession charges and moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that his initial arrest had been illegal.  Assuming that there was a Fourth Amendment violation, the District Court concluded that the exclusionary rule did not apply and denied the motion to suppress.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that the arresting officers were innocent of any wrongdoing, and that Dale Countys failure to update the records was merely negligent.  The court therefore concluded that the benefit of suppression would be marginal or nonexistent and that the evidence was admissible under the good-faith rule of United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897.
Held: When police mistakes leading to an unlawful search are the result of isolated negligence attenuated from the search, rather than systemic error or reckless disregard of constitutional requirements, the exclusionary rule does not apply.  Pp. 413.
(a)The fact that a search or arrest was unreasonable does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies.  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 223.  The rule is not an individual right and applies only where its deterrent effect outweighs the substantial cost of letting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go free.  Leon, 468 U. S., at 908909.  For example, it does not apply if police acted in objectively reasonable reliance on an invalid warrant.  Id., at 922.  In applying Leons good-faith rule to police who reasonably relied on mistaken information in a courts database that an arrest warrant was outstanding, Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 1415, the Court left unresolved the issue confronted here: whether evidence should be suppressed if the police committed the error, id., at 16, n.5.  Pp. 47.


(b)The extent to which the exclusionary rule is justified by its deterrent effect varies with the degree of law enforcement culpability.  See, e.g., Leon, supra, at 911.  Indeed, the abuses that gave rise to the rule featured intentional conduct that was patently unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.383.  An error arising from nonrecurring and attenuated negligence is far removed from the core concerns that led to the rules adoption.  Pp. 79.


(c)To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.  The pertinent analysis is objective, not an inquiry into the arresting officers subjective awareness.  See, e.g., Leon, supra, at 922, n. 23.  Pp. 911.


(d)The conduct here was not so objectively culpable as to require exclusion.  The marginal benefits that might follow from suppressing evidence obtained in these circumstances cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion.  Leon, supra, at 922.  Pp. 1113.
492 F.3d 1212,  affirmed.

07-901|"OREGON v. ICE
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 07901.Argued October 14, 2008Decided January 14, 2009
Respondent Ice twice entered an 11-year-old girls residence and sexually assaulted her.  For each of the incidents, an Oregon jury found Ice guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the victims vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching her breasts.  Ice was sentenced under a state statute providing, generally, for concurrent sentences, Ore. Rev. Stat. 137.123(1), but allowing the judge to impose consecutive sentences in these circumstances: (1) when a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for  offenses that do not arise from the same  course of conduct, 137.123(2), and (2) when offenses arise from the same course of conduct, if the judge finds either (a) [t]hat the  offense  was an indication of defendants willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or  (b) [t]he  offense  caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different  harm to the victim, 137.123(5).  The trial judge first found that the two burglaries constituted separate incidents and exercised his discretion to impose consecutive sentences for those crimes under 137.123(2).  The court then found that each offense of touching the victims vagina met 137.123(5)s two criteria, giving the judge discretion to impose the sentences for those offenses consecutive to the two associated burglary sentences.  The court elected to do so, but ordered that the sentences for touching the victims breasts run concurrently with the other sentences.  On appeal, Ice argued, inter alia, that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, holding that the Sixth Amendments jury-trial guarantee requires that the jury, rather than the judge, determine any fact (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime.  The appellate court affirmed, but the Oregon Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Apprendi rule applied because the imposition of consecutive sentences increased Ices quantum of punishment.  
Held:In light of historical practice and the States authority over administration of their criminal justice systems, the Sixth Amendment does not inhibit States from assigning to judges, rather than to juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses.  Pp.511.
(a)The Court declines to extend the Apprendi and Blakely line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions.  The Courts application of Apprendis rule must honor the longstanding common-law practice in which the rule is rooted.  Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281.  The rules animating principle is the preservation of the jurys historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477.  Because the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jurys traditional domain, see id., at 497, the Court considers whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within the jurys domain by the Bill of Rights framers, Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 557.  In so doing, the Court is also cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain.  See, e.g., Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201.  These twin considerationshistorical practice and respect for state sovereigntycounsel against extending Apprendi to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes.  P.6.


(b)The historical record demonstrates that both in England before this Nations founding and in the early American States, the common law generally entrusted the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses should be served consecutively or concurrently to judges unfettered discretion, assigning no role in the determination to the jury.  Thus, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted the Courts decision in Apprendi.  There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jurys domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused.  Instead, the defendantwho historically may have faced consecutive sentences by defaulthas been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.  Ices argument that he is entitled to concurrent sentences absent the factfindings Oregon law requires is rejected.  Because the scope of the federal constitutional jury right must be informed by the jurys historical common-law role, that right does not attach to every contemporary state-law entitlement to predicate findings.  For similar reasons, Cunningham, upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control here.  In holding that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated upper term sentence for a particular crime fell within the jurys province rather than the sentencing judges, 549 U. S., at 274, Cunningham had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jurys traditional role was at stake.  Pp.78. 


(c)States interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of Apprendi that Ice requests.  This Court should not diminish the States sovereign authority over the administration of their criminal justice systems absent impelling reason to do so.  Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the salutary objectives of promoting sentences proportionate to  the gravity of the offense, Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, and of reducing disparities in sentence length.  All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  To hem in States by holding that they may not choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense.  Neither Apprendi nor the Courts Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.  Further, the potential intrusion of Apprendis rule into other state initiatives on sentencing choices or accoutrementsfor example, permitting trial judges to find facts about the offenses nature or the defendants character in determining the length of supervised release, required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service, and the imposition of fines and restitutionwould cut the rule loose from its moorings.  Moreover, the expansion Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer, as the predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the trials guilt phase, potentially necessitating bifurcated or trifurcated trials.  Pp.910. 
343 Ore. 248, 170 P.3d 1049, reversed and remanded.

The appellate court affirmed, but the Oregon Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Apprendi rule applied because the imposition of consecutive sentences increased Ices quantum of punishment.  
Held:In light of historical practice and the States authority over administration of their criminal justice systems, the Sixth Amendment does not inhibit States from assigning to judges, rather than to juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses.  Pp.511.
(a)The Court declines to extend the Apprendi and Blakely line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions.  The Courts application of Apprendis rule must honor the longstanding common-law practice in which the rule is rooted.  Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281.  The rules animating principle is the preservation of the jurys historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477.  Because the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jurys traditional domain, see id., at 497, the Court considers whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within the jurys domain by the Bill of Rights framers, Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 557.  In so doing, the Court is also cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain.  See, e.g., Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201.  These twin considerationshistorical practice and respect for state sovereigntycounsel against extending Apprendi to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes.  P.6.


(b)The historical record demonstrates that both in England before this Nations founding and in the early American States, the common law generally entrusted the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses should be served consecutively or concurrently to judges unfettered discretion, assigning no role in the determination to the jury.  Thus, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted the Courts decision in Apprendi.  There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jurys domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused.  Instead, the defendantwho historically may have faced consecutive sentences by defaulthas been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.  Ices argument that he is entitled to concurrent sentences absent the factfindings Oregon law requires is rejected.  Because the scope of the federal constitutional jury right must be informed by the jurys historical common-law role, that right does not attach to every contemporary state-law entitlement to predicate findings.  For similar reasons, Cunningham, upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control here.  In holding that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated upper term sentence for a particular crime fell within the jurys province rather than the sentencing judges, 549 U. S., at 274, Cunningham had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jurys traditional role was at stake.  Pp.78. 


(c)States interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of Apprendi that Ice requests.  This Court should not diminish the States sovereign authority over the administration of their criminal justice systems absent impelling reason to do so.  Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the salutary objectives of promoting sentences proportionate to  the gravity of the offense, Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, and of reducing disparities in sentence length.  All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  To hem in States by holding that they may not choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense.  Neither Apprendi nor the Courts Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.  Further, the potential intrusion of Apprendis rule into other state initiatives on sentencing choices or accoutrementsfor example, permitting trial judges to find facts about the offenses nature or the defendants character in determining the length of supervised release, required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service, and the imposition of fines and restitutionwould cut the rule loose from its moorings.  Moreover, the expansion Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer, as the predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the trials guilt phase, potentially necessitating bifurcated or trifurcated trials.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 0611206.Argued November 10, 2008Decided January 13, 2009
The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15-year mandatory prison term on a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm who has three prior convictions for committing certain drug crimes or a violent felony, 18 U. S.C. 924(e)(1), defined as a crime punishable by more than one years imprisonment that, inter alia, involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  At petitioner Chambers sentencing for being a felon in possession of a firearm, the Government sought ACCAs 15-year mandatory prison term.  Chambers disputed one of his prior convictionsfailing to report for weekend confinementas falling outside the ACCA definition of violent felony.  The District Court treated the failure to report as a form of what the relevant state statute calls escape from [a] penal institution, and held that it qualified as a violent felony under ACCA.  The Seventh Circuit agreed.
Held:Illinois crime of failure to report for penal confinement falls outside the scope of ACCAs violent felony definition.  Pp.38.
(a)For purposes of ACCAs definitions, it is the generic crime that counts, not how the crime was committed on a particular occasion.  Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602.  This categorical approach requires courts to choose the right category, and sometimes the choice is not obvious.  The nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect.  The state statute at issue places together in a single section several different kinds of behavior, which, as relevant here, may be categorized either as failure to report for detention or as escape from custody.  Failure to report is a separate crime from escape.  Its underlying behavior differs from the more aggressive behavior underlying escape, and it is listed separately in the statutes title and body and is of a different felony class than escape.  At the same time, the statutory phrases setting forth the various kinds of failure to report describe roughly similar forms of behavior, thus constituting a single category.  Consequently, for ACCA purposes, the statute contains at least two separate crimes, escape and failure to report.  Pp.35.


(b)The failure to report crime does not satisfy ACCAs violent felony definition.  Although it is punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, it satisfies none of the other parts of the definition.  Most critically, it does not involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  Conceptually speaking, the crime amounts to a form of inaction, and there is no reason to believe that an offender who fails to report is otherwise doing something that poses a serious potential risk of physical injury.  The Governments argument that a failure to report reveals the offenders special, strong aversion to penal custodypointing to 3 state and federal cases over 30 years in which individuals shot at officers attempting to recapture themis unconvincing.  Even assuming the relevance of violence that may occur long after an offender fails to report, the offenders aversion to penal custody is beside the point.  The question is whether such an offender is significantly more likely than others to attack or resist an apprehender, thereby producing a serious risk of physical injury.  Here a United States Sentencing Commission report, showing no violence in 160 federal failure-to-report cases over 2 recent years, helps provide a negative answer.  The three reported cases to which the Government points do not show the contrary.  Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years; federal alone versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they show only a statistically insignificant risk of physical violence.  And the Government provides no other empirical information.  Pp.58.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 076984.Argued November 4, 2008Decided January 13, 2009
After petitioners state conviction for burglary became final on October 11, 1996, the state appellate court held in state habeas proceedings that petitioner had been denied his right to appeal and granted him the right to file an out-of-time appeal.  He filed the appeal, his conviction was affirmed, and his time for seeking certiorari in this Court expired on January 6, 2004.  Petitioner filed a second state habeas application on December 6, 2004, which was denied 355 days later, on June 29, 2005.  He then filed a federal habeas petition on July 19, 2005, relying on 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A) to establish its timeliness.  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) provides that the one-year limitations period for seeking review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) begins on the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  Petitioner argued that his judgment became final on January 6, 2004, when time expired for seeking certiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal, and that his July 19, 2005, petition was timely because the calculation of AEDPAs 1-year limitation period excludes the 355 days during which [his] properly filed application for State post-conviction  review  [was] pending, 2244(d)(2).  The District Court disagreed, ruling that the proper start date for calculating AEDPAs 1-year limitations period under 2244(d)(1)(A) was October 11, 1996, when petitioners conviction first became final.  The District Court dismissed the federal habeas petition as time barred.  The Fifth Circuit denied petitioners request for a certificate of appealability.   
Held:Where a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not final for purposes of 2244(d)(1)(A) until the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking certiorari review of that appeal.  This Court must enforce plain statutory language according to its terms.  See, e.g., Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534.  Under 2244(d)(1)(A)s plain language, once the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reopened direct review of petitioners conviction on September 25, 2002, the conviction was no longer final for 2244(d)(1)(A) purposes.  Rather, the order granting an out-of-time appeal restored the pendency of the direct appeal, and petitioners conviction was again capable of modification through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certiorari review.  Therefore, it was not until January 6, 2004, when time for seeking certiorari review of the decision in the out-of-time appeal expired, that petitioners conviction became final through the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review under 2244(d)(1)(A).  The Court rejects respondents argument that using the later date created by the state courts decision to reopen direct review, thus resetting AEDPAs 1-year limitations period, undermines the policy of finality that Congress established in 2244(d)(1).  See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 220.  Pp.58.
