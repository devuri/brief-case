09-837|"MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH etal. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 09837.Argued November 8, 2010Decided January 11, 2011
Petitioners (hereinafter Mayo) offer residency programs to doctors who have graduated from medical school and seek additional instruction in a chosen specialty.  Those programs train doctors primarily through hands-on experience.  Although residents are required to take part in formal educational activities, these doctors generally spend the bulk of their timetypically 50 to 80 hours a weekcaring for patients.  Mayo pays its residents annual stipends of over $40,000 and also provides them with health insurance, malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.  


The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) requires employees and employers to pay taxes on all wages employees receive, 26 U. S.C. 3101(a), 3111(a), and defines wages to include all remuneration for employment, 3121(a).  FICA defines employment as any service  performed  by an employee for the person employing him, 3121(b), but excludes from taxation any service performed in the employ of  a school, college, or university  if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at [the school], 3121(b)(10).  Since 1951, the Treasury Department has construed the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools as an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.  16 Fed. Reg. 12474.  In 2004, the Department issued regulations providing that [t]he services of a full-time employeewhich includes an employee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per weekare not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.  26 CFR 31.3121(b)(10)2(d)(3)(iii).  The Department explained that this analysis is not affected by the fact that the services  may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.  Ibid.  The rule offers as an example a medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform services 40 or more hours per week, and concludes that the resident is not a student.  


Mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid, and the District Court agreed.  It found the full-time employee rule inconsistent with 3121s unambiguous text and concluded that the factors governing this Courts analysis in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440 U. S. 472, also indicated that the rule was invalid.  The Eighth Circuit reversed.  Applying Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Departments regulation was a permissible interpretation of an ambiguous statute. 
Held:The Treasury Departments full-time employee rule is a reasonable construction of 3121(b)(10).  Pp.615.
(a)Under Chevrons two-part framework, the Court first asks whether Congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue.  467 U. S., at 842-843.  Congress has not done so here; the statute does not define student or otherwise attend to the question whether medical residents are subject to FICA.  Pp.67.


(b) The parties debate whether the Court should next apply Chevron step two or the multi-factor analysis used to review a tax regulation in National Muffler.  Absent a justification to do so, this Court is not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate Treasury Department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by any other agency.  The Court has [r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action.  Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154.  And the principles underlying Chevron apply with full force in the tax context.  Chevron recognized that an agencys power to administer a congressionally created  program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left  by Congress.  467 U. S., at 843.  Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by other agencies in administering their statutes. 


It is true that the full-time employee rule, like the rule at issue in National Muffler, was promulgated under the Departments general authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code.  26 U. S.C. 7805(a).  It is also true that this Court, in opinions predating Chevron, stated that it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific grants.  See Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247, 253; United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., 455 U. S. 16, 24.  Since then, however, the Court has found Chevron deference appropriate when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.  United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226227.  Chevron and Mead provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full-time employee rule.  The Department issued the rule pursuant to an explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations, and only after notice-and-comment procedures.  The Court has recognized these to be good indicators of a rule meriting Chevron deference, Mead, 533 U. S., at 229231.  Pp.712.


(c)The rule easily satisfies Chevrons second step. Mayo accepts the Treasury Departments determination that an individual may not qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect of that relationship, but objects to the Departments conclusion that residents working more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot satisfy that requirement.  Mayo argues that the Treasury Department should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into what each employee does and why he does it, and that the Department has arbitrarily distinguished between hands-on training and classroom instruction.  But regulation, like legislation, often requires drawing lines.  The Department reasonably sought to distinguish between workers who study and students who work.  Focusing on the hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to accomplish that goal.  The Department thus has drawn a distinction between education and service, not between classroom instruction and hands-on training.  The Treasury Department also reasonably concluded that its full-time employee rule would improve administrability, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, and thereby has avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accompany [a] case-by-case approach like the one Mayo advocates, United States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302.  Moreover, the rule reasonably takes into account the Social Security Administrations concern that exempting residents from FICA would deprive them and their families of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.  Pp.1215.
568 F.3d 675, affirmed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Kagan, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

09-350|"LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA v. HUMPHRIES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09350.Argued October 5, 2010Decided November 30, 2010
The Humphries (hereinafter respondents) were accused of child abuse in California, but were later exonerated.  However, under California law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index), where they would remain available to various state agencies for at least 10 years.  The statute has no procedures for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures.  Respondents filed suit under 1983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a declaration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hearing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.  The court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to attorneys fees, including $60,000 from the county.  The county objected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its policy or custom caused the deprivation of a plaintiffs federal right, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694; but a state policy caused any deprivation here.  The Ninth Circuit, inter alia, found that respondents did prevail against the county on their claim for declaratory relief because Monell did not apply to prospective relief claims. 
Held:Monells policy or custom requirement applies in 1983 cases irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.  Pp.410.
(a)In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court based its holding that municipal entities were not person[s] under 1983 on the provisions legislative history, particularly Congress rejection of the so-called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities liable for damages done by private persons riotously and tumultuously assembled, id., at 188190, and n.38.  Reexamining this legislative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe.  It concluded that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others.  The Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history, went on to explain what acts are the municipalitys own for purposes of liability.  The Court held that a municipality cannot be held liable solely for the acts of others, e.g., solely because it employs a tortfeasor, 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable when execution of a governments policy or custom  inflicts the injury, id., at 694.  Pp.47.


(b)Section 1983, read in light of Monells understanding of the legislative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall within the scope of the policy or custom requirement.  Nothing in 1983 suggests that the causation requirement should change with the form of relief sought.  In fact, the text suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets 1983s elements shall be liable  in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.  Thus, as Monell explicitly stated, local governing bodies  can be sued directly under 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy or custom.  436 U. S., at 690.  To find the policy or custom requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would also undermine Monells logic.  For whether an action or omission is a municipalitys own has to do with the nature of the action or omission, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court. Pp.78.


(c)Respondents arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  Pp.89.

09-479|"ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 09479.Argued October 4, 2010Decided November 15, 2010
Petitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions, were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of 18 U. S.C. 924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a deadly weapon in connection with any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, 924(c)(1).  The minimum prison term for a 924(c) offense is five years, 924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the [offender], 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Abbott was convicted on the 924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  He received a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession conviction and an additional five years for his 924(c) violation.  Goulds predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence; he received an additional five years for his 924(c) violation.  On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their 924(c) sentences, resting their objections on the except clause prefacing 924(c)(1)(A).  That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five-year term as a consecutive sentence [e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [924(c) itself] or by any other provision of law.  Abbott urged that the except clause was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.  The Third Circuit affirmed Abbotts sentence, concluding that the except clause refers only to other minimum sentences that may be imposed for 924(c) violations.  Gould fared no better before the Fifth Circuit.
Held:A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in 924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.  Pp.518.
(a)Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, but the except clause was not added until 1998.  Under the pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not preempt 924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been correctly sentenced under 924(c).  The question here is whether Congress 1998 reformulation of 924(c) rendered their sentences excessive.  The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that 924(c)(1)s ban on use of a firearm did not reach mere possession of a weapon, id., at 144.  In addition to bringing possession within the statutes compass, Congress increased the severity of 924(c) sentences by changing once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences, United States v. OBrien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.  Congress also restructured the provision, divid[ing] what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs, id., at ___, and it added the except clause at issue.  Pp.58.


(b)The leading portion of the except clause now prefacing 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a greater minimum sentence  otherwise provided by [924(c) itself]; the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside 924(c) by any other provision of law.  To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided  by any other provision of law, the key question is: otherwise provided for what?  Most courts have answered: for the conduct 924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.


Abbott and Gould disagree.  Gould would apply the except clause whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater minimum sentence.  Abbott argues that the minimum sentence otherwise provided must be one imposed for the criminal transaction that triggered 924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense involving the same firearm that triggered 924(c).  These three interpretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress in 1998 adopted  a less aggressive mode of applying 924(c), one that significantly reduced the severity of the provisions impact on defendants.  The pre-1998 version of 924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.  It is unlikely that Congress meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed An Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns, to effect a departure so great from 924(c)s original insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punishment for 924(c) violations.  Abbotts and Goulds readings would undercut that same bills primary objective: to expand 924(c)s coverage to reach firearm possession.  Their readings would also result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend.  Section 924(c), as they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.  Stranger still, the worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction would be most likely to preempt 924(c) sentences.  Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies and order appropriate adjustments.  While a judge exercising discretion under 18 U. S.C. 3553(a) would not be required to sentence a more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Congress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on 3553(a).  Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve disparities by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.  But Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended 924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement.  Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of 924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement might suffice to accomplish 924(c)s objective.  Nor is there any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guidelines relationship to 924(c) when it added the except clause.  Pp.814.


(c)The Governments readingthat the except clause is triggered only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct violating 924(c)makes far more sense.  It gives effect to statutory language commanding that all 924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command reiterated three times: First, the statute states that the 924(c)(1) punishment shall be imposed in addition to the penalty for the predicate offense, 924(c)(1)(A); second, 924(c) demands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime itself provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device, ibid.; third, 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that a 924(c) sentence might run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.  Interpreting the except clause to train on conduct offending 924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct 924(c) proscribes.  See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534535.  There is strong contextual support for the view that the except clause was intended simply to clarify 924(c).  At the same time Congress added the clause, it made the rest of 924(c) more complex, dividing its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.  Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges: It added the except clauses initial part, which covers greater minimums provided by this subsection, to instruct judges not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the same weapon.  In referencing greater minimums provided by any other provision of law, the second portion of the clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which 924(c) and a different statute both punish conduct offending 924(c).  Congress likely anticipated such cases when framing the except clause, for the bill that reformulated 924(c)s text also amended 18 U. S.C. 3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons convicted of firearms possession (as described in 924(c)).  This interpretation does not render the except clauses second part effectively meaningless.  Though 3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of 924(c) itself, that the Government places within the except clause, the any other provision of law portion installs a safety valve for additional sentences that Congress may codify outside 924(c) in the future.  Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion.  Pp.1418.

			"|"ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 09479.Argued October 4, 2010Decided November 15, 2010
Petitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions, were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of 18 U. S.C. 924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a deadly weapon in connection with any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, 924(c)(1).  The minimum prison term for a 924(c) offense is five years, 924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the [offender], 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Abbott was convicted on the 924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  He received a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession conviction and an additional five years for his 924(c) violation.  Goulds predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence; he received an additional five years for his 924(c) violation.  On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their 924(c) sentences, resting their objections on the except clause prefacing 924(c)(1)(A).  That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five-year term as a consecutive sentence [e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [924(c) itself] or by any other provision of law.  Abbott urged that the except clause was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.  The Third Circuit affirmed Abbotts sentence, concluding that the except clause refers only to other minimum sentences that may be imposed for 924(c) violations.  Gould fared no better before the Fifth Circuit.
Held:A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in 924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.  Pp.518.
(a)Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, but the except clause was not added until 1998.  Under the pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not preempt 924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been correctly sentenced under 924(c).  The question here is whether Congress 1998 reformulation of 924(c) rendered their sentences excessive.  The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that 924(c)(1)s ban on use of a firearm did not reach mere possession of a weapon, id., at 144.  In addition to bringing possession within the statutes compass, Congress increased the severity of 924(c) sentences by changing once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences, United States v. OBrien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.  Congress also restructured the provision, divid[ing] what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs, id., at ___, and it added the except clause at issue.  Pp.58.


(b)The leading portion of the except clause now prefacing 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a greater minimum sentence  otherwise provided by [924(c) itself]; the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside 924(c) by any other provision of law.  To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided  by any other provision of law, the key question is: otherwise provided for what?  Most courts have answered: for the conduct 924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.


Abbott and Gould disagree.  Gould would apply the except clause whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater minimum sentence.  Abbott argues that the minimum sentence otherwise provided must be one imposed for the criminal transaction that triggered 924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense involving the same firearm that triggered 924(c).  These three interpretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress in 1998 adopted  a less aggressive mode of applying 924(c), one that significantly reduced the severity of the provisions impact on defendants.  The pre-1998 version of 924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.  It is unlikely that Congress meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed An Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns, to effect a departure so great from 924(c)s original insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punishment for 924(c) violations.  Abbotts and Goulds readings would undercut that same bills primary objective: to expand 924(c)s coverage to reach firearm possession.  Their readings would also result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend.  Section 924(c), as they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.  Stranger still, the worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction would be most likely to preempt 924(c) sentences.  Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies and order appropriate adjustments.  While a judge exercising discretion under 18 U. S.C. 3553(a) would not be required to sentence a more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Congress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on 3553(a).  Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve disparities by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.  But Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended 924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement.  Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of 924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement might suffice to accomplish 924(c)s objective.  Nor is there any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guidelines relationship to 924(c) when it added the except clause.  Pp.814.


(c)The Governments readingthat the except clause is triggered only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct violating 924(c)makes far more sense.  It gives effect to statutory language commanding that all 924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command reiterated three times: First, the statute states that the 924(c)(1) punishment shall be imposed in addition to the penalty for the predicate offense, 924(c)(1)(A); second, 924(c) demands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime itself provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device, ibid.; third, 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that a 924(c) sentence might run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.  Interpreting the except clause to train on conduct offending 924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct 924(c) proscribes.  See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534535.  There is strong contextual support for the view that the except clause was intended simply to clarify 924(c).  At the same time Congress added the clause, it made the rest of 924(c) more complex, dividing its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.  Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges: It added the except clauses initial part, which covers greater minimums provided by this subsection, to instruct judges not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the same weapon.  In referencing greater minimums provided by any other provision of law, the second portion of the clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which 924(c) and a different statute both punish conduct offending 924(c).  Congress likely anticipated such cases when framing the except clause, for the bill that reformulated 924(c)s text also amended 18 U. S.C. 3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons convicted of firearms possession (as described in 924(c)).  This interpretation does not render the except clauses second part effectively meaningless.  Though 3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of 924(c) itself, that the Government places within the except clause, the any other provision of law portion installs a safety valve for additional sentences that Congress may codify outside 924(c) in the future.

10-91|"BILL K. WILSON, SUPERINTENDANT, INDIANA
STATE PRISON v. JOSEPH E. CORCORAN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 1091.Decided November 8, 2010
Per Curiam.

Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners whose confinement does not violate federal law.  Because the Court of Appeals granted the writ to respondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its judgment and remand.
***

In 1997, respondent Joseph Corcoran shot and killed four men, including his brother and his sisters fiance.  An Indiana jury found him guilty of four counts of murder, found the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple murders, and unanimously recommended capital punishment.  The trial judge agreed and sentenced respondent to death.
But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated the sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have violated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory aggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.  Corcoran v. State, 739 N.E. 2d 649, 657658 (2000).  When addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court had remarked:
[T]he knowing and intentional murders of four innocent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated crime. I dont think in the history of this county weve had a mass murderer such as yourself.  It makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass murderer.  And I am convinced in my heart of hearts,  if given the opportunity, you will murder again.  Id., at 657 (quoting transcript).

According to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial judges reference to the innocence of respondents victims, the heinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness was not necessarily improper; it is permissible to provide an appropriate context for consideration of the alleged aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  But because the trial court might have meant that it weighed these factors as aggravating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court remanded for resentencing.  See ibid.


On remand, the trial court issued a revised sentencing order.  It wrote:
The trial Court, in balancing the proved aggravators and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court that it only relied upon those proven statutory aggravators.  The trial Courts remarks at the sentencing hearing, and the language in the original sentencing order explain why such high weight was given to the statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further support the trial Courts personal conclusion that the sentence is appropriate punishment for this offender and these crimes.  Corcoran v. State, 774 N.E. 2d 495, 498 (Ind. 2002) (quoting order).

On appeal, over respondents objection, the Supreme Court accepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence.  Id., at 498499, 502.  It explained that it was now satisfied that the trial court has relied on only aggravators listed in Indiana Code 355029(b).  There is no lack of clarity in [the trial courts] statement and no plausible reason to believe it untrue.  Id., at 499.


Respondent later applied to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of habeas corpus.  His habeas petition asserted a number of grounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, notwithstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court improperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors when it resentenced him.  Respondent also asserted that this reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Record, Doc. 13, p. 11.  In its response to the petition, the State specifically disputed that contention.  Id., Doc. 33, p. 16 ([Respondent] fails to establish any constitutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Courts review of the trial courts treatment of Corcorans sentence on remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme courts judgment is in any way inconsistent with applicable United States Supreme Court precedent).


The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this dispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly different ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a jury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment.  Corcoran v. Buss, 483 F.Supp. 2d 709, 725726 (2007).  It did not address the sentencing challenge because that was rendered moot by the grant of habeas relief.  Id., at 734.


The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts Sixth Amendment ruling.  Corcoran v. Buss, 551 F.3d 703, 712, 714 (2008).  Then, evidently overlooking respondents remaining sentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to deny the writ.  Id., at 714.  To correct this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the Seventh Circuits judgment.  Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 558 U. S. 1 (2009) (per curiam).  We explained that the Court of Appeals should have permitted the District Court to consider Corcorans unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why such consideration was unnecessary.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).


On remandand without any opportunity for briefing by the partiesthe Court of Appeals changed course and granted habeas relief.  Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 593 F.3d 547, 555 (2010).  After determining that respondents sentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to include it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review.  Id., at 551.  The panel explained that, unlike the Indiana Supreme Court, it was unsatisfied with the trial courts representation that it relied only on aggravating factors authorized by Indiana law.  Ibid.  Because the trial courts revised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory factors of heinousness, victims innocence, and future dangerousness to determine the weight given to the aggravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had made an unreasonable determination of the facts when it accepted the trial courts representation that it did not rely on those factors as aggravating circumstances.  Ibid. (quoting 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2)).  The panel therefore required the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentencing determination in order to prevent non-compliance with Indiana law.  593 F. 3d, at 552553.


But it is only noncompliance with federal law that renders a States criminal judgment susceptible to collateral attack in the federal courts.  The habeas statute unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to a state prisoner only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(a).  And we have repeatedly held that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).  [I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.  502 U. S., at 6768.  But here, the panels opinion contained no hint that it thought the violation of Indiana law it had unearthed also entailed the infringement of any federal right.  Not only did the court frame respondents claim as whether the Indiana trial court considered non-statutory aggravating circumstances  in contravention of state law, 593 F.3d, at 551 (emphasis added), it also explicitly acknowledged that [n]othing in [its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule permitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death sentence selection process.  See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878 (1983) (permitting their use under federal law), id., at 551552 (citations omitted).


Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an unreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2).  That provision allows habeas petitioners to avoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to federal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by showing that the state courts decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  It does not repeal the command of 2254(a) that habeas relief may be afforded to a state prisoner only on the ground that his custody violates federal law.


In response to the Seventh Circuits opinion, the State filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc.  The States petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred by granting relief in the absence of a federal violation.  It also contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wainwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983) (per curiam), that the Court of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana Supreme Courts factual determination that its own trial court complied with Indiana law.


The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its opinion to include this language:
This [remand for resentencing] will cure the state trial courts unreasonable determination of the facts.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1) [sic].  (It will also prevent noncompliance with Indiana law.  [Corcoran] contended that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompliance with state law also violates the federal Constitution and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2).  [The State] has not advanced any contrary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983), or any similar decision.)  App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a145a.

The amendment did not cure the defect.  It is not enough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the existence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court agrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief.  The Seventh Circuits opinion reflects no such agreement, nor does it even articulate what federal right was allegedly infringed.  In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the court maintains that it would not violate federal law for Indiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court did.  593 F. 3d, at 551552.


In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional error, the amended opinion says only that the State had not advanced any contrary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode  or any similar decision.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a.  It is not clear what this language was meant to convey.  It cannot have meant that the State forfeited the position that respondents allegations do not state a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the State explicitly disputed that point before the District Courtthe last forum in which the subject had been raised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that respondent had waived the claim entirely.  593 F.3d, at 551.  And there is no suggestion that the State has ever conceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in accordance with Indiana law.  Under those circumstances, it was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue the writ without first concluding that a violation of federal law had been established.


The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We express no view about the merits of the habeas petition.
 It is so ordered.

08-1371|"CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW, aka HASTINGS CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP v. MARTINEZ etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081371.Argued April 19, 2010Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the University of California public-school system, extends official recognition to student groups through its Registered Student Organization (RSO) program.  Several benefits attend this school-approved status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as Hastings name and logo.  In exchange for recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions.  Critical here, all RSOs must comply with the schools Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.  


At the beginning of the 20042005 academic year, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country.  These chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and officers to sign a Statement of Faith and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles.  Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman.  CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in unrepentant homosexual conduct or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.  Hastings rejected CLSs application for RSO status on the ground that the groups bylaws did not comply with Hastings open-access policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual orientation. 


CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that Hastings refusal to grant the group RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for Hastings.  The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLSs right to free speech.  Nor, in the courts view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLSs right to expressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any student, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed conditions on the use of school facilities and funds.  The court also rejected CLSs free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimination Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral and of general applicability.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.
Held: 
1.The Court considers only whether a public institutions conditioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.  CLS urges the Court to review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as writtenprohibiting discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation.  The policys written terms, CLS contends, target solely those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to limit membership to persons committed to the groups ideology.  This argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: Hastings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate,  regardless of [her] status or beliefs.  For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs .  This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and cannot contradict, their stipulations.  See, e.g., Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 226.  The Court therefore rejects CLSs attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to Hastings policy as written.  Pp. 812.


2.The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress First Amendment limitations.  Pp. 1231. 


(a)The Courts limited public forum decisions supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLSs free-speech and expressive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829.  CLS urges the Court to apply to its expressive-association claim a different line of casesdecisions in which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associational freedom in the context of public accommodations, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623.  But, because CLSs expressive-association and free-speech arguments mergewho speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyedit makes little sense to treat the claims as discrete.  Instead, three observations lead the Court to analyze CLSs arguments under limited-public-forum precedents.


First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as compared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in a limited public forum.  Speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked.  See id., at 622.  When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review under the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.  Second, the strict scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forumsthe States authority to reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.  Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829.  Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition.  The Courts expressive-association decisions, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out.  See, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648.  Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition.  Pp. 1217.


(b)In three cases, this Court held that public universities had unconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treatment because of their points of view.  See Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263; and Rosenberger.  Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, the Court held that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook.  Once it has opened a limited [public] forum, the Court emphasized, the State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.  515 U. S. at 829.  It may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,  nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of  viewpoint.  Ibid.  Pp. 1719.


(c)Hastings all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account the RSO forums function and all the surrounding circumstances.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 809.  Pp. 1928.


(1)The Courts inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: First Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.  Widmar, 454 U. S., at 268, n.5.  This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints.  The Court has, however, cautioned courts to resist substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy for those of  school authorities, for judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school administrators.  Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206.  Because schools enjoy a significant measure of authority over the type of officially recognized activities in which their students participate, Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.  Pp. 1921. 


(2)The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forums purposes.  First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students.  RSOs are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.  Second, the policy helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSOs motivation for membership restrictions.  CLSs proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimination due to status would impose on Hastings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.  Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.  Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination proscriptions, thereby conveying Hastings decision to decline to subsidize conduct disapproved by the State.  So long as a public school does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state-law goals stands on firm footing.  Pp. 2124. 


(3)Hastings policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the substantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take place.  Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 53.  Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain bulletin boards to advertise events.  Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of electronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance of those channels.  Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school affiliation.  CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of students attending those meetings and events doubled.  The variety and type of alternative modes of access present here, in short, compare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where [the Court has] upheld restrictions.  Id., at 5354.  Pp. 2425. 


(4)CLSs arguments that the all-comers policy is not reasonable are unavailing.  CLS contends that there can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints, but this argument confuses CLSs preferred policy with constitutional limitationthe advisability of Hastings policy does not control its permissibility.  A States restriction on access to a limited public forum, moreover, need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.  Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808.  CLSs contention that Hastings policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs by student saboteurs bent on subverting a groups mission is more hypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO-hijackings at Hastings.  Cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 584.  Finally, CLSs assertion that Hastings lacks any legitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co-religionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo, while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out.  Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a groups desire to exclude and students demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no group to discriminate in membership.  Pp. 2528.


(d)Hastings all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.  Pp. 2831. 


(1)The policy draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective; its requirement that all student groups accept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral.  Pp.2829.


(2)Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts that it systematicallyand impermissiblyburdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.  This argument fails because [a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791.  Hastings requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied, is justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.  Id., at 791.  It targets the act of rejecting would-be group members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior.  Pp. 2931. 


3.Neither lower court addressed CLSs argument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comers policy.  This Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in the first instance.  On remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider this argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.  Pp. 3132.

			"|"CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW, aka HASTINGS CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP v. MARTINEZ etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081371.Argued April 19, 2010Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the University of California public-school system, extends official recognition to student groups through its Registered Student Organization (RSO) program.  Several benefits attend this school-approved status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as Hastings name and logo.  In exchange for recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions.  Critical here, all RSOs must comply with the schools Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.  


At the beginning of the 20042005 academic year, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country.  These chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and officers to sign a Statement of Faith and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles.  Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman.  CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in unrepentant homosexual conduct or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.  Hastings rejected CLSs application for RSO status on the ground that the groups bylaws did not comply with Hastings open-access policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual orientation. 


CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that Hastings refusal to grant the group RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for Hastings.  The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLSs right to free speech.  Nor, in the courts view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLSs right to expressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any student, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed conditions on the use of school facilities and funds.  The court also rejected CLSs free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimination Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral and of general applicability.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.
Held: 
1.The Court considers only whether a public institutions conditioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.  CLS urges the Court to review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as writtenprohibiting discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation.  The policys written terms, CLS contends, target solely those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to limit membership to persons committed to the groups ideology.  This argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: Hastings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate,  regardless of [her] status or beliefs.  For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs .  This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and cannot contradict, their stipulations.  See, e.g., Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 226.  The Court therefore rejects CLSs attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to Hastings policy as written.  Pp. 812.


2.The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress First Amendment limitations.  Pp. 1231. 


(a)The Courts limited public forum decisions supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLSs free-speech and expressive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829.  CLS urges the Court to apply to its expressive-association claim a different line of casesdecisions in which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associational freedom in the context of public accommodations, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623.  But, because CLSs expressive-association and free-speech arguments mergewho speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyedit makes little sense to treat the claims as discrete.  Instead, three observations lead the Court to analyze CLSs arguments under limited-public-forum precedents.


First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as compared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in a limited public forum.  Speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked.  See id., at 622.  When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review under the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.  Second, the strict scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forumsthe States authority to reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.  Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829.  Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition.  The Courts expressive-association decisions, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out.  See, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648.  Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition.  Pp. 1217.


(b)In three cases, this Court held that public universities had unconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treatment because of their points of view.  See Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263; and Rosenberger.  Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, the Court held that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook.  Once it has opened a limited [public] forum, the Court emphasized, the State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.  515 U. S. at 829.  It may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,  nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of  viewpoint.  Ibid.  Pp. 1719.


(c)Hastings all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account the RSO forums function and all the surrounding circumstances.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 809.  Pp. 1928.


(1)The Courts inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: First Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.  Widmar, 454 U. S., at 268, n.5.  This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints.  The Court has, however, cautioned courts to resist substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy for those of  school authorities, for judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school administrators.  Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206.  Because schools enjoy a significant measure of authority over the type of officially recognized activities in which their students participate, Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.  Pp. 1921. 


(2)The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forums purposes.  First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students.  RSOs are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.  Second, the policy helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSOs motivation for membership restrictions.  CLSs proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimination due to status would impose on Hastings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.  Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.  Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination proscriptions, thereby conveying Hastings decision to decline to subsidize conduct disapproved by the State.  So long as a public school does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state-law goals stands on firm footing.  Pp. 2124. 


(3)Hastings policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the substantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take place.  Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 53.  Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain bulletin boards to advertise events.  Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of electronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance of those channels.  Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school affiliation.  CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of students attending those meetings and events doubled.  The variety and type of alternative modes of access present here, in short, compare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where [the Court has] upheld restrictions.  Id., at 5354.  Pp. 2425. 


(4)CLSs arguments that the all-comers policy is not reasonable are unavailing.  CLS contends that there can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints, but this argument confuses CLSs preferred policy with constitutional limitationthe advisability of Hastings policy does not control its permissibility.  A States restriction on access to a limited public forum, moreover, need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.  Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808.  CLSs contention that Hastings policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs by student saboteurs bent on subverting a groups mission is more hypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO-hijackings at Hastings.  Cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 584.  Finally, CLSs assertion that Hastings lacks any legitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co-religionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo, while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out.  Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a groups desire to exclude and students demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no group to discriminate in membership.  Pp. 2528.


(d)Hastings all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.  Pp. 2831. 


(1)The policy draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective; its requirement that all student groups accept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral.  Pp.2829.


(2)Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts that it systematicallyand impermissiblyburdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.  This argument fails because [a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791.  Hastings requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied, is justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.  Id., at 791.  It targets the act of rejecting would-be group members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior.  Pp. 2931. 


3.Neither lower court addressed CLSs argument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comers policy.  This Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in the first instance.  On remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider this argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.  Pp. 3132.

08-1521|"McDONALD etal. v. CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 081521.Argued March 2, 2010Decided June 28, 2010
Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home.  Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens.  After Heller, petitioners filed this federal suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related actions, alleging that the Citys handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals.  They sought a declaration that the ban and several related City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.  Rejecting petitioners argument that the ordinances are unconstitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow established Circuit precedent.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century casesUnited States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535which were decided in the wake of this Courts interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendments Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36. 
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
567 F.3d 856, reversed and remanded.  
Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, IIB, IID, IIIA, and IIIB, concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, recognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.  Pp.59, 1119, 1933.  


(a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions.  Primarily, they argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Slaughter-House Cases narrow interpretation of the Clause should now be rejected.  As a secondary argument, they contend that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right.  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any civilized legal system.  If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that right is not protected by due process.  And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such measures.  Pp.45. 


(b)The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g., Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil Wars aftermath fundamentally altered the federal system.  Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights which owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws, 16 Wall., at 79, and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Federal Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76.  Under this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only very limited rights.  Id., at 7980.  Subsequently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Seventh Circuit relied in this case.  Pp.59.


(c)Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the States is considered in light of the Courts precedents applying the Bill of Rights protections to the States.  Pp.1119.


(1)In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights protections.  See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516.  Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted.  First, the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.  See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99.  Second, the Court explained that the only rights due process protected against state infringement were those of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.  Ibid.  Third, some cases during this era can be seen as having asked  if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection asserted therein.  Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n.14.  Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights guarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection, finding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hurtado, supra.  Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from those provided against abridgment by the Federal Government.  Pp.1113.


(2)Justice Black championed the alternative theory that 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of Rights provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 7172 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that theory.  Pp.1315.


(3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by Justice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by which the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments.  See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U. S. 335, 341.  These decisions abandoned three of the characteristics of the earlier period.  The Court clarified that the governing standard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is fundamental to our Nations particular scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice.  Duncan, supra, at 149, n.14.  The Court eventually held that almost all of the Bill of Rights guarantees met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Court also held that Bill of Rights protections must all  be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10.  Under this approach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.  See, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455.  Pp.1519.


 (d)The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States.  Pp.1933.  


(1)The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to the Nations scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether it is deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721.  Heller points unmistakably to the answer.  Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held that individual self-defense is the central component of the Second Amendment right.  554 U. S., at ___, ___.  Explaining that the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute in the home, ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because they are the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of ones home and family, id., at ___, ______.  It thus concluded that citizens must be permitted to use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.  Id., at ___.  Heller also clarifies that this right is deeply rooted in this Nations history and traditions, Glucksberg, supra, at 721.  Heller explored the rights origins in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was regarded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  This is powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.  That understanding persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era, which  protected the  right to keep and bear arms.  Pp.1922. 


(2)A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates clearly that the Fourteenth Amendments Framers and ratifiers counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to the Nations system of ordered liberty.  Pp.2233. 


(i)By the 1850s, the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense.  Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm Free-Soilers in Bloody Kansas, met with outrage that the constitutional right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people.  After the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.  These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmens Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the right to keep and bear arms.  Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth Amendment.  Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act.  See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389.  In Congressional debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection.  Evidence from the period immediately following the Amendments ratification confirms that that right was considered fundamental.  Pp.2231. 


(ii)Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule.  But while 1 does contain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause, it can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit discrimination.  If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for specialand specially unfavorabletreatment, the Court rejects the suggestion.  The right to keep and bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.  Pp.3033. 


Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded, in Parts IIC, IV, and V, that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller.  Pp.1011, 3344.   


(a)Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one of the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  There is no need to reconsider the Courts interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases  because, for many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether particular rights are protected against state infringement under the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.    Pp.1011.


(b)Municipal respondents remaining arguments are rejected because they are at war with Hellers central holding.  In effect, they ask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a different body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.  Pp.3340.


(c)The dissents objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp.4144.


Justice Thomas agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recognized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable to the States.  However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion that is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second Amendments text and history.  The Court is correct in describing the Second Amendment right as fundamental to the American scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and deeply rooted in this Nations history and traditions, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721.  But the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause, which speaks only to process, cannot impose the type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court asserts.  Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship recognized by 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter alia: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  In interpreting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are written to be understood by the voters.  Heller, 554 U. S., at ___.  The objective of this inquiry is to discern what ordinary citizens at the time of the Fourteenth Amendments ratification would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean.  Ibid.  A survey of contemporary legal authorities plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep and bear arms.

			"|"McDONALD etal. v. CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 081521.Argued March 2, 2010Decided June 28, 2010
Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home.  Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens.  After Heller, petitioners filed this federal suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related actions, alleging that the Citys handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals.  They sought a declaration that the ban and several related City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.  Rejecting petitioners argument that the ordinances are unconstitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow established Circuit precedent.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century casesUnited States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535which were decided in the wake of this Courts interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendments Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36. 
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
567 F.3d 856, reversed and remanded.  
Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, IIB, IID, IIIA, and IIIB, concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, recognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.  Pp.59, 1119, 1933.  


(a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions.  Primarily, they argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Slaughter-House Cases narrow interpretation of the Clause should now be rejected.  As a secondary argument, they contend that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right.  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any civilized legal system.  If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that right is not protected by due process.  And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such measures.  Pp.45. 


(b)The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g., Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil Wars aftermath fundamentally altered the federal system.  Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights which owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws, 16 Wall., at 79, and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Federal Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76.  Under this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only very limited rights.  Id., at 7980.  Subsequently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Seventh Circuit relied in this case.  Pp.59.


(c)Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the States is considered in light of the Courts precedents applying the Bill of Rights protections to the States.  Pp.1119.


(1)In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights protections.  See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516.  Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted.  First, the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.  See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99.  Second, the Court explained that the only rights due process protected against state infringement were those of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.  Ibid.  Third, some cases during this era can be seen as having asked  if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection asserted therein.  Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n.14.  Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights guarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection, finding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hurtado, supra.  Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from those provided against abridgment by the Federal Government.  Pp.1113.


(2)Justice Black championed the alternative theory that 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of Rights provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 7172 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that theory.  Pp.1315.


(3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by Justice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by which the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments.  See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U. S. 335, 341.  These decisions abandoned three of the characteristics of the earlier period.  The Court clarified that the governing standard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is fundamental to our Nations particular scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice.  Duncan, supra, at 149, n.14.  The Court eventually held that almost all of the Bill of Rights guarantees met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Court also held that Bill of Rights protections must all  be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10.  Under this approach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.  See, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455.  Pp.1519.


 (d)The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States.  Pp.1933.  


(1)The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to the Nations scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether it is deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721.  Heller points unmistakably to the answer.  Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held that individual self-defense is the central component of the Second Amendment right.  554 U. S., at ___, ___.  Explaining that the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute in the home, ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because they are the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of ones home and family, id., at ___, ______.  It thus concluded that citizens must be permitted to use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.  Id., at ___.  Heller also clarifies that this right is deeply rooted in this Nations history and traditions, Glucksberg, supra, at 721.  Heller explored the rights origins in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was regarded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  This is powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.  That understanding persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era, which  protected the  right to keep and bear arms.  Pp.1922. 


(2)A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates clearly that the Fourteenth Amendments Framers and ratifiers counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to the Nations system of ordered liberty.  Pp.2233. 


(i)By the 1850s, the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense.  Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm Free-Soilers in Bloody Kansas, met with outrage that the constitutional right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people.  After the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.  These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmens Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the right to keep and bear arms.  Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth Amendment.  Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act.  See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389.  In Congressional debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection.  Evidence from the period immediately following the Amendments ratification confirms that that right was considered fundamental.  Pp.2231. 


(ii)Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule.  But while 1 does contain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause, it can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit discrimination.  If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for specialand specially unfavorabletreatment, the Court rejects the suggestion.  The right to keep and bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.  Pp.3033. 


Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded, in Parts IIC, IV, and V, that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller.  Pp.1011, 3344.   


(a)Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one of the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  There is no need to reconsider the Courts interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases  because, for many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether particular rights are protected against state infringement under the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.    Pp.1011.


(b)Municipal respondents remaining arguments are rejected because they are at war with Hellers central holding.  In effect, they ask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a different body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.  Pp.3340.


(c)The dissents objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp.4144.


Justice Thomas agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recognized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable to the States.  However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion that is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second Amendments text and history.  The Court is correct in describing the Second Amendment right as fundamental to the American scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and deeply rooted in this Nations history and traditions, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721.  But the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause, which speaks only to process, cannot impose the type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court asserts.  Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship recognized by 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter alia: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  In interpreting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are written to be understood by the voters.  Heller, 554 U. S., at ___.  The objective of this inquiry is to discern what ordinary citizens at the time of the Fourteenth Amendments ratification would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean.  Ibid.  A survey of contemporary legal authorities plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep and bear arms.  Pp.134.
Alito, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, IIB, IID, IIIA, and IIIB, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts IIC, IV, and V, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., join.

08-964|"BILSKI etal. v. KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 08964.Argued November 9, 2009Decided June 28, 2010
Petitioners patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy market can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes.  The key claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a simple mathematical formula.  The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand.  The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical problem.  The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and affirmed.  The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed.  The en banc court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable process under Patent Act, 35 U. S.C. 101i.e., whether the invention produced a useful, concrete, and tangible result, see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368, 1373holding instead that a claimed process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.  Concluding that this machine-or-transformation test is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a process under 101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not patent eligible.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.  
545 F.3d 943, affirmed.
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts IIB2 and IIC2, concluding that petitioners claimed invention is not patent eligible.  Pp.48, 1011, 1216.


(a)Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions or discoveries that are patent eligible: process[es], machin[es], manufactur[es], and composition[s] of matter.  In choosing such expansive terms,  Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope, Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308, in order to ensure that ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement, id., at 308309.  This Courts precedents provide three specific exceptions to 101s broad principles: laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.  Id., at 309.  While not required by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the notion that a patentable process must be new and useful.  And, in any case, the exceptions have defined the statutes reach as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years.  See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174.  The 101 eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test.  Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the four categories, it must also satisfy the conditions and requirements of this title, 101(a), including novelty, see 102, nonobviousness, see 103, and a full and particular description, see 112.  The invention at issue is claimed to be a process, which 100(b) defines as a process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.  Pp.45. 


(b)The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for patent eligibility under 101.  The Courts precedents establish that although that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible process under 101.  In holding to the contrary, the Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation: Courts should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed, Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 182, and, [u]nless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, ibid.  The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of process that would require it to be tied to a machine or the transformation of an article.  Respondent Patent Director urges the Court to read 101s other three patentable categories as confining process to a machine or transformation.  However, the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for 100(b) already explicitly defines process, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the sections inclusion of those other categories suggests that a process must be tied to one of them.  Finally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.  Recent authorities show that the test was never intended to be exhaustive or exclusive.  See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588, n.9.  Pp.58. 


(c)Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term process that would categorically exclude business methods.  The term method within 100(b)s process definition, at least as a textual matter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and this Courts precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business.  The Court is unaware of any argument that the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, Diehr, supra, at 182, of method excludes business methods.  Nor is it clear what a business method exception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently.  The categorical exclusion argument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents: Under 273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on a method in [a] patent, the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use.  By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents.  Section 273 thus clarifies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of method that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under 101.  A contrary conclusion would violate the canon against interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous.  See Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Finally, while 273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions.  Pp.1011.   


(d)Even though petitioners application is not categorically outside of 101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is a process under 101.  Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets.  Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, however, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent abstract ideas.  Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and reduce that concept to a mathematical formula.  This is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.  Petitioners remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent the use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation.  They add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook.  Pp.1215. 


(e)Because petitioners patent application can be rejected under the Courts precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable process, beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in 100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.  Nothing in todays opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal Circuits past interpretations of 101.  See, e.g., State Street, 49 F.3d, at 1373.  The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents.  In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the Federal Circuits development of other limiting criteria that further the Patent Acts purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.  P.16. 
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts IIB2 and IIC2.  Roberts, C.J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined the opinion in full, and Scalia, J., joined except for Parts IIB2 and IIC2.

The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents.  In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the Federal Circuits development of other limiting criteria that further the Patent Acts purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 081191.Argued March 29, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
In 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank whose ordinary shares are not traded on any exchange in this country, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquartered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgagesseeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc.  In 2001, National had to write down the value of HomeSides assets, causing Nationals share prices to fall.  Petitioners, Australians who purchased Nationals shares before the write-downs, sued respondentsNational, HomeSide, and officers of both companiesin Federal District Court for violation of 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b5.  They claimed that HomeSide and its officers had manipulated financial models to make the companys mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of this deception.  Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The District Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that concluded abroad.  The Second Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1.The Second Circuit erred in considering 10(b)s extraterritorial reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).  What conduct 10(b) reaches is a merits question, while subject-matter jurisdiction refers to a tribunals power to hear a case.  Union Pacific R.Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U. S.C. 78aa to adjudicate the 10(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  Pp.45.


2.Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plaintiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in connection with securities traded on foreign exchanges.  Pp.524.


(a)It is a longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco).  When a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.  Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange Acts silence about 10(b)s extraterritorial application permitted the court to discern whether Congress would have wanted the statute to apply.  This disregard of the presumption against extraterritoriality has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.  The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.  Pp.512.


(b)Because Rule 10b5 was promulgated under 10(b), it does not extend beyond conduct encompassed by 10(b)s prohibition.  United States v. OHagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651.  Thus, if 10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b5.  On its face, 10(b) contains nothing to suggest that it applies abroad.  Contrary to the argument of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign commerce in the definition of interstate commerce, see 15 U. S.C. 78c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritoriality, Aramco, supra, at 251.  Nor does a fleeting reference, in 78b(2)s description of the Exchange Acts purposes, to the dissemination and quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities.  Nor does Exchange Act 30(b), which says that the Act does not apply to any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States, unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the SEC to prevent  evasion of [the Act].  This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has extraterritorial application; the Commissions enabling regulations preventing evasion seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal a domestic violation.  The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor General also fails to account for 30(a), which explicitly provides for a specific extraterritorial application.  That provision would be quite superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to transactions on foreign exchangesand its limitation of that application to securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative.  There being no affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that 10(b) applies extraterritorially, it does not.  Pp.1216.


(c)The domestic activity in this caseFlorida is where HomeSide and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and where some misleading public statements were madedoes not mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act.  It is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all contact with United States territory.  In Aramco, for example, where the plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see 499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the focus of congressional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employment.  Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Acts focus is not on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and sales of securities in the United States.  Section 10(b) applies only to transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic transactions in other securities.  The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by the Exchange Acts prologue, see 48 Stat. 881, and by the fact that the Acts registration requirements apply only to securities listed on national securities exchanges, 78l(a).  This focus is also strongly confirmed by 30(a) and (b).  Moreover, the Court rejects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probability of incompatibility with other countries laws is so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign application it would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.  499 U. S., at 256.  Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a violation where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the United States.  Pp.1724.
547 F.3d 167, affirmed.

08-1214|"GRANITE ROCK CO. v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081214.Argued January 19, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
In June 2004, respondent local union (Local), supported by its parent international (IBT), initiated a strike against petitioner Granite Rock, the employer of some of Locals members, following the expiration of the parties collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and an impasse in their negotiations.  On July 2, the parties agreed to a new CBA containing no-strike and arbitration clauses, but could not reach a separate back-to-work agreement holding local and international union members harmless for any strike-related damages Granite Rock incurred.  IBT instructed Local to continue striking until Granite Rock approved such a hold-harmless agreement, but the company refused to do so, informing Local that continued strike activity would violate the new CBAs no-strike clause.  IBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide strike involving numerous facilities and workers, including members of other IBT locals.


Granite Rock sued IBT and Local, invoking federal jurisdiction under 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), seeking strike-related damages for the unions alleged breach of contract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new CBA.  The unions conceded 301(a) jurisdiction, but asserted that the new CBA was never validly ratified by a vote of Locals members, and, thus, the CBAs no-strike clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock to challenge the strike.  After Granite Rock amended its complaint to add claims that IBT tortiously interfered with the new CBA, the unions moved to dismiss.  The District Court granted IBTs motion to dismiss the tortious interference claims on the ground that 301(a) supports a federal cause of action only for breach of contract.  But the court denied Locals separate motion to send the parties dispute over the CBAs ratification date to arbitration, ruling that a jury should decide whether ratification occurred on July 2, as Granite Rock contended, or on August 22, as Local alleged.  After the jury concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, the court ordered arbitration to proceed on Granite Rocks breach-of-contract claims.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the tortious interference claims, but reversed the arbitration order, holding that the parties ratification-date dispute was a matter for an arbitrator to resolve under the CBAs arbitration clause.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that the clause covered the ratification-date dispute because the clause clearly covered the related strike claims; national policy favoring arbitration required ambiguity about the arbitration clauses scope to be resolved in favor of arbitrability; and, in any event, Granite Rock had implicitly consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute by suing under the contract.  
Held:
1.The parties dispute over the CBAs ratification date was a matter for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve.  Pp. 620.


(a)Whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute is typically an issue for judicial determination, e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83, as is a dispute over an arbitration contracts formation, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944.  These principles would neatly dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical.  But it is not.  It is based on when (not whether) the new CBA containing the parties arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed.  To determine whether the parties dispute over the CBAs ratification date is arbitrable, it is necessary to apply the rule that a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only when satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.  See, e.g., id., at 943.  To satisfy itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue that calls into question the specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have the court enforce.  See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, ante, at 46.  Absent an agreement committing them to an arbitrator, such issues typically concern the scope and enforceability of the parties arbitration clause.  In addition, such issues always include whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that agreement was formed.  Pp. 67. 


(b)In cases invoking the federal policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes, Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368, 377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, and discharge their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) ordering arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, e.g., id., at 651652.  Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption takes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitrability.  This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration only those disputes  the parties have agreed to submit, First Options, supra, at 943, nor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for party agreement, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648651.  The presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly committing the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best construed to encompass the dispute.  See, e.g., First Options, supra, at 944945.  This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Circuits judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related questions central to Locals arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local wishes to arbitrate.  Pp. 713. 


(c)The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBAs terms was necessary to form the contract.  For purposes of determining arbitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it was formed.  That is so where, as here, an agreements ratification date determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties dispute.  This formation date question requires judicial resolution here because it relates to Locals arbitration demand in a way that required the District Court to determine the CBAs ratification date in order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters the demand covered.  The CBA requires arbitration only of disputes that arise under the agreement.  The parties ratification-date dispute does not clearly fit that description.  But the Ninth Circuit credited Locals argument that the ratification-date dispute should be presumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dispute) that does clearly arise under the CBA.  The Ninth Circuit overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date disputes arbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed until August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to arise under.  Local attempts to address this flaw in the Circuits reasoning by arguing that a December 2004 document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired.  The Court of Appeals did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either because it was not raised in Locals brief in opposition to the certiorari petition.  Pp. 1317.


(d)Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals judgment is that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dispute or not, falls outside the arbitration clauses scope on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure.  CBA 20 provides, inter alia, that [a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure, which includes arbitration.  The parties ratification-date dispute cannot properly be said to fall within this provisions scope for at least two reasons.  First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004a question concerning the CBAs very existencecannot fairly be said to arise under the CBA.  Second, even if the arising under language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, 20s remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing that sections arbitration requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory mediation.  The Ninth Circuits contrary conclusion finds no support in 20s text.  That courts only effort to grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Granite Rocks claim to enforce the CBAs no-strike provisions could be characterized as arising under the agreement, which is not the dispositive issue here.  Pp. 1718. 


(e)Locals remaining argument in support of the Court of Appeals judgmentthat Granite Rock implicitly consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the CBAs no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisionsis similarly unavailing.  Although it sought an injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rocks decision to sue does not establish an agreement, implicit or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBAs formation date) that the company did not raise and has always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clauses scope.  Pp. 1920.


2.The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new federal common-law cause of action under LMRA 301(a) for IBTs alleged tortious interference with the CBA.  Though virtually all other Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so in this case is inconsistent with federal labor laws goal of promoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement of CBAs, and with this Courts precedents holding that a federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451.  The company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other potential avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims, unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims, are either unavailable or insufficient.  But Granite Rock has not yet exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide an opportunity to judge their efficacy.  Accordingly, it would be premature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even assuming 301(a) authorizes this Court to do so.  That is particularly true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the unions attempts to delay the new CBAs ratification.  Those proceedings, and others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Granite Rocks assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declining to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.  Pp. 2025.

S. 368, 377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, and discharge their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) ordering arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, e.g., id., at 651652.  Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption takes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitrability.  This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration only those disputes  the parties have agreed to submit, First Options, supra, at 943, nor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for party agreement, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648651.  The presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly committing the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best construed to encompass the dispute.  See, e.g., First Options, supra, at 944945.  This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Circuits judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related questions central to Locals arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local wishes to arbitrate.  Pp. 713. 


(c)The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBAs terms was necessary to form the contract.  For purposes of determining arbitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it was formed.  That is so where, as here, an agreements ratification date determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties dispute.  This formation date question requires judicial resolution here because it relates to Locals arbitration demand in a way that required the District Court to determine the CBAs ratification date in order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters the demand covered.  The CBA requires arbitration only of disputes that arise under the agreement.  The parties ratification-date dispute does not clearly fit that description.  But the Ninth Circuit credited Locals argument that the ratification-date dispute should be presumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dispute) that does clearly arise under the CBA.  The Ninth Circuit overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date disputes arbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed until August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to arise under.  Local attempts to address this flaw in the Circuits reasoning by arguing that a December 2004 document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired.  The Court of Appeals did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either because it was not raised in Locals brief in opposition to the certiorari petition.  Pp. 1317.


(d)Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals judgment is that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dispute or not, falls outside the arbitration clauses scope on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure.  CBA 20 provides, inter alia, that [a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure, which includes arbitration.  The parties ratification-date dispute cannot properly be said to fall within this provisions scope for at least two reasons.  First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004a question concerning the CBAs very existencecannot fairly be said to arise under the CBA.  Second, even if the arising under language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, 20s remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing that sections arbitration requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory mediation.  The Ninth Circuits contrary conclusion finds no support in 20s text.  That courts only effort to grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Granite Rocks claim to enforce the CBAs no-strike provisions could be characterized as arising under the agreement, which is not the dispositive issue here.  Pp. 1718. 


(e)Locals remaining argument in support of the Court of Appeals judgmentthat Granite Rock implicitly consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the CBAs no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisionsis similarly unavailing.  Although it sought an injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rocks decision to sue does not establish an agreement, implicit or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBAs formation date) that the company did not raise and has always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clauses scope.  Pp. 1920.


2.The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new federal common-law cause of action under LMRA 301(a) for IBTs alleged tortious interference with the CBA.  Though virtually all other Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so in this case is inconsistent with federal labor laws goal of promoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement of CBAs, and with this Courts precedents holding that a federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451.  The company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other potential avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims, unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims, are either unavailable or insufficient.  But Granite Rock has not yet exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide an opportunity to judge their efficacy.  Accordingly, it would be premature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even assuming 301(a) authorizes this Court to do so.  That is particularly true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the unions attempts to delay the new CBAs ratification.  Those proceedings, and others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Granite Rocks assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declining to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.

08-1394|"SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 081394.Argued March 1, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company in America.  Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was Enrons chief executive officer from February until August 2001, when he resigned.  Less than four months later, Enron crashed into bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value.  After an investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enrons stock prices by overstating the companys financial well-being, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme.  In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme to deceive investors about Enrons true financial performance by manipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading statements.  Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud, 18 U. S.C. 371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.  Skilling was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enrons auditors, and insider trading.


In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contending that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors.  He submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enrons downfall, as well as affidavits from experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.  The District Court denied the motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.  Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed, media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional, and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational.  Moreover, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.


In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for questions it might use to screen prospective jurors.  Rejecting the Governments sparer inquiries in favor of Skillings more probing and specific questions, the court converted Skillings submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document.  The questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.  The court then mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all of them.  It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 individuals, and the parties, with the courts approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability.  The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from being impartial.


In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skillings co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty.  Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causeys guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.  The court again declined to move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.  The court also denied Skillings request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with lawyers.  But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants jointly two extra peremptory challenges.

Voir dire began in January 2006.  After questioning the venire as a group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.  The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties challenges for cause.  Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.  After a 4-month trial, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts. 


On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here.  First, he contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.  Second, he alleged that the jury improperly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud.  As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enrons collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice.  Stating, however, that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire, found it proper and thorough, and held that the District Court had empaneled an impartial jury.  The Court of Appeals also rejected Skillings claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud.  It did not address Skillings argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.  
Held:
1.Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial.  He did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  Pp.1134.


(a)The District Court did not err in denying Skillings requests for a venue transfer.  Pp.1119.


(1)Although the Sixth Amendment and Art.III, 2, cl.3, provide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial.  Pp.1112. 


(2)The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Circuits analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723.  Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them.  Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised three times to large local audiences shortly before trial.  After the Louisiana trial court denied Rideaus change-of-venue motion, he was convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal.  This Court reversed.  [T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it, the Court explained, the interrogation in a very real sense was Rideaus trialat which he pleaded guilty.   Id., at 726.  [W]ithout pausing to examine  the voir dire, the Court held that the kangaroo court proceedings trailing the televised confession violated due process.  Id., at 726727.  The Court followed Rideau in two other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal prosecutions.  However, it later explained that those decisions cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to  news accounts of the crime  alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.  Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798799.  Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality does not require ignorance.  See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 722.  A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme case.  Pp.1216.  


(3)Important differences separate Skillings prosecution from those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice.  First, the Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.  In contrast to the small-town setting in Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nations fourth most populous city.  Given the large, diverse pool of residents eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain.  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideaus dramatically staged admission of guilt.  Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years elapsed between Enrons bankruptcy and Skillings trial.  Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enrons collapse.  Finally, and of prime significance, Skillings jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts.  Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors actions run counter to that presumption.  Pp.1618.  


(4)The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed at Enron.  But pretrial publicityeven pervasive, adverse publicitydoes not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.  Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554.  Here, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houstons size and diversity diluted the medias impact.  Nor did Enrons sheer number of victims trigger a presumption.  Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.  Finally, while Causeys well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropriate steps to mitigate that risk.  Pp.1819.


(b)No actual prejudice contaminated Skillings jury.  The Court rejects Skillings assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect and defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.  Pp.2034. 


(1)No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of voir dire.  Jury selection is particularly within the province of the trial judge.  Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594595.  When pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense because the judge sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect and may base her evaluation on her own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.  MuMin v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427.  The Court considers the adequacy of jury selection in Skillings case attentive to the respect due to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.  Pp.2021. 


(2)Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of constitutional requirements.  The jury-selection process was insufficient, Skilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of the District Courts questions were conclusory and failed adequately to probe jurors true feelings, and the court consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter any other indications of bias.  This Courts review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.  The District Court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling.  That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmination of a lengthy process.  Moreover, inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors largely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the corporations collapse.  Whatever community prejudice existed in Houston generally, Skillings jurors were not under its sway.  Relying on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727728, Skilling asserts the District Court should not have accepted jurors promises of fairness.  But a number of factors show that the District Court had far less reason than the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors assurances of impartiality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvins rampage of robberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvins trial proceeded; circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in Irvin; and Skillings seated jurors exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin.  In any event, the District Court did not simply take venire members at their word.  It questioned each juror individually to uncover concealed bias.  This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors backgrounds, opinions, and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.  Pp.2230.  


(3)Skillings allegation that several jurors were openly biased also fails.  In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: A trial courts findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.  MuMin, 500 U. S., at 428.  Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause, strong evidence that he was convinced the [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.  Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557558.  A review of the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Jurors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove its case.  Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no signs of prejudice this Court can discern.  Pp.3134.   


2.Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of the intangible right of honest services, is properly confined to cover only bribery and kickback schemes.  Because Skillings alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Courts confinement of 1346s proscription.  Pp.  3451.


(a)To place Skillings claim that 1346 is unconstitutionally vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent application of the honest-services doctrine.  Pp.3438.


(1)In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statutes prohibition of any scheme or artifice to defraud to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.  See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110, which stimulated the development of the honest-services doctrine.  Unlike traditional fraud, in which the victims loss of money or property supplied the defendants gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest-services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.  While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment.  Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that partys right to the offenders honest services.  Most often these cases involved bribery of public officials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to his employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks.  By 1982, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.  Pp.3437. 


(2)In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360, which held that the mail-fraud statute was limited in scope to the protection of property rights.  If Congress desires to go further, the Court stated, it must speak more clearly.  Ibid.  P.37.  


(3)Congress responded the next year by enacting 1346, which provides: For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, 1341, and wire fraud, 1343], the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.  Pp 3738. 


(b)Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.3851.


(1)To satisfy due process, a penal statute [must] define the criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357.  The void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these requirements.  Skilling contends that 1346 meets neither of the two due-process essentials.  But this Court must, if possible, construe, not condemn, Congress enactments.  See, e.g., Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571.  Alert to 1346s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute.  Uniformly, however, they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague.  This Court agrees that 1346 should be construed rather than invalidated.  P.3839. 


(2)The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase the intangible right of honest services.  There is no doubt that Congress intended 1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized in Courts of Appeals decisions before McNally derailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud.  Congress, it bears emphasis, enacted 1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the statute using that decisions terminology.  See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.  Pp. 3940.  


(3)To preserve what Congress certainly intended 1346 to cover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.  In parsing the various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skillings vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions were not models of clarity or consistency.  It has long been the Courts practice, however, before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.  See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657.  Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core because the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.  This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers, 413 U. S., at 571572.  Although some applications of the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes.  Indeed, McNally itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern.  483 U. S., at 352353, 360.  In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress intended 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.  Because reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that 1346 criminalizes only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.  Pp.4145. 


(4)The Government urges the Court to go further by reading 1346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee.  Neither of the Governments arguments in support of this position withstands close inspection.  Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a classic kickback scheme.  See 483 U. S., at 352353, 360.  Reading 1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacksand nothing moresatisfies Congress undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.  Nor is the Court persuaded by the Governments argument that the pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine.  Although the Courts of Appeals upheld honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified.  Given the relative infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting construction of 1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.  Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.  Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25.  The Court therefore resists the Governments less constrained construction of 1346 absent Congress clear instruction otherwise.  If Congress desires to go further, the Court reiterates, it must speak more clearly than it has.  McNally, 483 U. S., at 360.  Pp.4547.


(5)Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes, 1346 is not unconstitutionally vague.  A prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of ones honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary-prosecution problem.  See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357.  As to fair notice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101, and the statutes mens rea requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101104.  As to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out of shape.  Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.  Pp. 4849.  


(c)Skilling did not violate 1346, as the Court interprets the statute.  The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enrons shareholders by misrepresenting the companys fiscal health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.  Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracyhonest-services wire fraud, money-or-property wire fraud, and securities fraudSkillings conviction is flawed.  See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298.  This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless-error analysis. The Court leaves the parties dispute about whether the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of Skillings other convictions.  Pp.4950.

			"|"SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 081394.Argued March 1, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company in America.  Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was Enrons chief executive officer from February until August 2001, when he resigned.  Less than four months later, Enron crashed into bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value.  After an investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enrons stock prices by overstating the companys financial well-being, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme.  In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme to deceive investors about Enrons true financial performance by manipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading statements.  Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud, 18 U. S.C. 371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.  Skilling was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enrons auditors, and insider trading.


In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contending that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors.  He submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enrons downfall, as well as affidavits from experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.  The District Court denied the motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.  Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed, media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional, and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational.  Moreover, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.


In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for questions it might use to screen prospective jurors.  Rejecting the Governments sparer inquiries in favor of Skillings more probing and specific questions, the court converted Skillings submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document.  The questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.  The court then mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all of them.  It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 individuals, and the parties, with the courts approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability.  The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from being impartial.


In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skillings co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty.  Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causeys guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.  The court again declined to move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.  The court also denied Skillings request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with lawyers.  But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants jointly two extra peremptory challenges.

Voir dire began in January 2006.  After questioning the venire as a group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.  The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties challenges for cause.  Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.  After a 4-month trial, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts. 


On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here.  First, he contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.  Second, he alleged that the jury improperly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud.  As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enrons collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice.  Stating, however, that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire, found it proper and thorough, and held that the District Court had empaneled an impartial jury.  The Court of Appeals also rejected Skillings claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud.  It did not address Skillings argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.  
Held:
1.Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial.  He did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  Pp.1134.


(a)The District Court did not err in denying Skillings requests for a venue transfer.  Pp.1119.


(1)Although the Sixth Amendment and Art.III, 2, cl.3, provide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial.  Pp.1112. 


(2)The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Circuits analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723.  Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them.  Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised three times to large local audiences shortly before trial.  After the Louisiana trial court denied Rideaus change-of-venue motion, he was convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal.  This Court reversed.  [T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it, the Court explained, the interrogation in a very real sense was Rideaus trialat which he pleaded guilty.   Id., at 726.  [W]ithout pausing to examine  the voir dire, the Court held that the kangaroo court proceedings trailing the televised confession violated due process.  Id., at 726727.  The Court followed Rideau in two other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal prosecutions.  However, it later explained that those decisions cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to  news accounts of the crime  alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.  Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798799.  Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality does not require ignorance.  See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 722.  A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme case.  Pp.1216.  


(3)Important differences separate Skillings prosecution from those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice.  First, the Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.  In contrast to the small-town setting in Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nations fourth most populous city.  Given the large, diverse pool of residents eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain.  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideaus dramatically staged admission of guilt.  Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years elapsed between Enrons bankruptcy and Skillings trial.  Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enrons collapse.  Finally, and of prime significance, Skillings jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts.  Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors actions run counter to that presumption.  Pp.1618.  


(4)The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed at Enron.  But pretrial publicityeven pervasive, adverse publicitydoes not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.  Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554.  Here, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houstons size and diversity diluted the medias impact.  Nor did Enrons sheer number of victims trigger a presumption.  Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.  Finally, while Causeys well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropriate steps to mitigate that risk.  Pp.1819.


(b)No actual prejudice contaminated Skillings jury.  The Court rejects Skillings assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect and defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.  Pp.2034. 


(1)No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of voir dire.  Jury selection is particularly within the province of the trial judge.  Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594595.  When pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense because the judge sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect and may base her evaluation on her own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.  MuMin v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427.  The Court considers the adequacy of jury selection in Skillings case attentive to the respect due to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.  Pp.2021. 


(2)Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of constitutional requirements.  The jury-selection process was insufficient, Skilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of the District Courts questions were conclusory and failed adequately to probe jurors true feelings, and the court consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter any other indications of bias.  This Courts review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.  The District Court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling.  That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmination of a lengthy process.  Moreover, inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors largely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the corporations collapse.  Whatever community prejudice existed in Houston generally, Skillings jurors were not under its sway.  Relying on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727728, Skilling asserts the District Court should not have accepted jurors promises of fairness.  But a number of factors show that the District Court had far less reason than the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors assurances of impartiality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvins rampage of robberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvins trial proceeded; circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in Irvin; and Skillings seated jurors exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin.  In any event, the District Court did not simply take venire members at their word.  It questioned each juror individually to uncover concealed bias.  This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors backgrounds, opinions, and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.  Pp.2230.  


(3)Skillings allegation that several jurors were openly biased also fails.  In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: A trial courts findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.  MuMin, 500 U. S., at 428.  Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause, strong evidence that he was convinced the [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.  Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557558.  A review of the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Jurors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove its case.  Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no signs of prejudice this Court can discern.  Pp.3134.   


2.Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of the intangible right of honest services, is properly confined to cover only bribery and kickback schemes.  Because Skillings alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Courts confinement of 1346s proscription.  Pp.  3451.


(a)To place Skillings claim that 1346 is unconstitutionally vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent application of the honest-services doctrine.  Pp.3438.


(1)In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statutes prohibition of any scheme or artifice to defraud to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.  See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110, which stimulated the development of the honest-services doctrine.  Unlike traditional fraud, in which the victims loss of money or property supplied the defendants gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest-services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.  While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment.  Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that partys right to the offenders honest services.  Most often these cases involved bribery of public officials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to his employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks.  By 1982, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.  Pp.3437. 


(2)In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360, which held that the mail-fraud statute was limited in scope to the protection of property rights.  If Congress desires to go further, the Court stated, it must speak more clearly.  Ibid.  P.37.  


(3)Congress responded the next year by enacting 1346, which provides: For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, 1341, and wire fraud, 1343], the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.  Pp 3738. 


(b)Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.3851.


(1)To satisfy due process, a penal statute [must] define the criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357.  The void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these requirements.  Skilling contends that 1346 meets neither of the two due-process essentials.  But this Court must, if possible, construe, not condemn, Congress enactments.  See, e.g., Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571.  Alert to 1346s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute.  Uniformly, however, they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague.  This Court agrees that 1346 should be construed rather than invalidated.  P.3839. 


(2)The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase the intangible right of honest services.  There is no doubt that Congress intended 1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized in Courts of Appeals decisions before McNally derailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud.  Congress, it bears emphasis, enacted 1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the statute using that decisions terminology.  See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.  Pp. 3940.  


(3)To preserve what Congress certainly intended 1346 to cover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.  In parsing the various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skillings vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions were not models of clarity or consistency.  It has long been the Courts practice, however, before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.  See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657.  Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core because the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.  This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers, 413 U. S., at 571572.  Although some applications of the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes.  Indeed, McNally itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern.  483 U. S., at 352353, 360.  In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress intended 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.  Because reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that 1346 criminalizes only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.  Pp.4145. 


(4)The Government urges the Court to go further by reading 1346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee.  Neither of the Governments arguments in support of this position withstands close inspection.  Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a classic kickback scheme.  See 483 U. S., at 352353, 360.  Reading 1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacksand nothing moresatisfies Congress undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.  Nor is the Court persuaded by the Governments argument that the pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine.  Although the Courts of Appeals upheld honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified.  Given the relative infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting construction of 1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.  Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.  Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25.  The Court therefore resists the Governments less constrained construction of 1346 absent Congress clear instruction otherwise.  If Congress desires to go further, the Court reiterates, it must speak more clearly than it has.  McNally, 483 U. S., at 360.  Pp.4547.


(5)Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes, 1346 is not unconstitutionally vague.  A prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of ones honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary-prosecution problem.  See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357.  As to fair notice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101, and the statutes mens rea requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101104.  As to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out of shape.  Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.  Pp. 4849.  


(c)Skilling did not violate 1346, as the Court interprets the statute.  The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enrons shareholders by misrepresenting the companys fiscal health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.  Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracyhonest-services wire fraud, money-or-property wire fraud, and securities fraudSkillings conviction is flawed.  See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298.  This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless-error analysis. The Court leaves the parties dispute about whether the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of Skillings other convictions.  Pp.4950.

08-861|"FREE ENTERPRISE FUND etal. v. PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 08861.Argued December 7, 2009Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Board is composed of five members appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industrysuch as the New York Stock Exchangethat investigate and discipline their own members subject to Commission oversight.  Unlike these organizations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.  Every accounting firm that audits public companies under the securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.  The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal investigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.  The parties agree that the Board is part of the Government for constitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are Officers of the United States who exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125126.  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board members at will, but only for good cause shown, in accordance with specified procedures.  7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3).  The parties also agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be removed by the President except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  Humphreys Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602, 620.


The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.  The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members, seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.  Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board members without subjecting them to Presidential control.  The basis for petitioners challenge was that Board members were insulated from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause, and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the President for good cause.  Petitioners also challenged the Boards appointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires officers to be appointed by the President with the Senates advice and consent, orin the case of inferior Officersby the President alone,  the Courts of Law, or  the Heads of Departments, Art.II, 2, cl.2.  The United States intervened to defend the statute.  The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It first agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction.  It then ruled that the dual restraints on Board members removal are permissible, and that Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent with the Appointments Clause.
Held:
1.The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims.  The Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an aggrieved party may challenge the Commissions final order or rule in a court of appeals under 15 U. S.C. 78y.  The Government reads 78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.  It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review; if the suit is wholly collateral to a statutes review provisions; and if the claims are outside the agencys expertise.  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212213.


These considerations point against any limitation on review here.  Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and petitioners challenge is collateral to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.  The Government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but petitioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no meaningful avenue of relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a sanction in order to test a laws validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129.  Petitioners constitutional claims are also outside the Commissions competence and expertise, and the statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.  Pp.710.


2.The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitutions separation of powers.  Pp.1027.


(a)The Constitution provides that [t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.  Art.II, 1, cl.1.  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower the President to keep executive officers accountableby removing them from office, if necessary.  See generally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52.  This Court has determined that this authority is not without limit.  In Humphreys Executor, supra, this Court held that Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause.  And in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officersthemselves responsible to the Presidentto remove their own inferiors.  However, this Court has not addressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause tenure.  Pp.1014.


(b)Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the Presidents removal power, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power.  The Presidentor a subordinate he could remove at willdecided whether the officers conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.  Here, the Act not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists.  That decision is vested in other tenured officersthe Commissionerswho are not subject to the Presidents direct control.  Because the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Boards conduct.  He can only review the Commissioners determination of whether the Acts rigorous good-cause standard is met.  And if the President disagrees with that determination, he is powerless to interveneunless the determination is so unreasonable as to constitute inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  Humphreys Executor, supra, at 620.


This arrangement contradicts Article IIs vesting of the executive power in the President.  Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Boards failings to those whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Boards conduct.  He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board members breach of faith.  If this dispersion of responsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure.  Such diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the blame for a pernicious measure should fall.  The Acts restrictions are therefore incompatible with the Constitutions separation of powers.  Pp.1417.


(c)The fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736.  The Acts multilevel tenure protections provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.  Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive offices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence.  The Framers created a structure in which [a] dependence on the people would be the primary controul on the government, and that dependence is maintained by giving each branch the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349.  A key constitutional means vested in the President was the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.  1 Annals of Congress 463.  While a government of opposite and rival interests may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No. 51, at 349, [t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.  Bowsher, supra, at 730.  Pp.1721.


(d)The Government errs in arguing that, even if some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the Constitution, the restrictions here do not.  There is no construction of the Commissions good-cause removal power that is broad enough to avoid invalidation.  Nor is the Commissions broad power over Board functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members.  Altering the Boards budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it.  Moreover, the Commissions power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of the Commission.  Enacting new SEC rules through the required notice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micromanaging the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions.  Finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of good-cause removal.  Pp.2127.


3.The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.  Because [t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions, Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commn of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the normal rule is that partial  invalidation is the required course, Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504.  The Boards existence does not violate the separation of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by 7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do.  Concluding that the removal restrictions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will.  With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains fully operative as a law, New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186, and nothing in the Acts text or historical context makes it evident that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684.  The consequence is that the Board may continue to function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the Commission.  Pp.2729.


4.The Boards appointment is consistent with the Appointments Clause.  Pp. 2933.


(a)The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in a Hea[d] of Departmen[t].  Inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by superiors appointed by the President with the Senates consent.  Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662663.  Because the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members at will, in addition to its other oversight authority.  Board members are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission.  Pp. 2930.


(b)The Commission is a Departmen[t] under the Appointments Clause.  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifically reserved the question whether a principal agenc[y], such as the SEC, is a Departmen[t].  The Court now adopts the reasoning of the concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that the SEC is such a Departmen[t] because it is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within any other such component.  This reading is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a department; with the early practice of Congress, see 3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Courts cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.  Pp. 3031.


(c)The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the Commissions Hea[d].  The Commissions powers are generally vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.  The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative functions subject to the full Commissions policies.  There is no reason why a multimember body may not be the Hea[d] of a Departmen[t] that it governs.  The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the Courts of Law, Art.II, 2, cl.2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers collectively, see, e.g., Art.I, 2, cl.5.  Practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.  Pp.3133.

			"|"FREE ENTERPRISE FUND etal. v. PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 08861.Argued December 7, 2009Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Board is composed of five members appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industrysuch as the New York Stock Exchangethat investigate and discipline their own members subject to Commission oversight.  Unlike these organizations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.  Every accounting firm that audits public companies under the securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.  The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal investigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.  The parties agree that the Board is part of the Government for constitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are Officers of the United States who exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125126.  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board members at will, but only for good cause shown, in accordance with specified procedures.  7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3).  The parties also agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be removed by the President except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  Humphreys Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602, 620.


The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.  The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members, seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.  Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board members without subjecting them to Presidential control.  The basis for petitioners challenge was that Board members were insulated from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause, and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the President for good cause.  Petitioners also challenged the Boards appointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires officers to be appointed by the President with the Senates advice and consent, orin the case of inferior Officersby the President alone,  the Courts of Law, or  the Heads of Departments, Art.II, 2, cl.2.  The United States intervened to defend the statute.  The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It first agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction.  It then ruled that the dual restraints on Board members removal are permissible, and that Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent with the Appointments Clause.
Held:
1.The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims.  The Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an aggrieved party may challenge the Commissions final order or rule in a court of appeals under 15 U. S.C. 78y.  The Government reads 78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.  It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review; if the suit is wholly collateral to a statutes review provisions; and if the claims are outside the agencys expertise.  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212213.


These considerations point against any limitation on review here.  Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and petitioners challenge is collateral to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.  The Government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but petitioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no meaningful avenue of relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a sanction in order to test a laws validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129.  Petitioners constitutional claims are also outside the Commissions competence and expertise, and the statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.  Pp.710.


2.The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitutions separation of powers.  Pp.1027.


(a)The Constitution provides that [t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.  Art.II, 1, cl.1.  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower the President to keep executive officers accountableby removing them from office, if necessary.  See generally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52.  This Court has determined that this authority is not without limit.  In Humphreys Executor, supra, this Court held that Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause.  And in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officersthemselves responsible to the Presidentto remove their own inferiors.  However, this Court has not addressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause tenure.  Pp.1014.


(b)Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the Presidents removal power, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power.  The Presidentor a subordinate he could remove at willdecided whether the officers conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.  Here, the Act not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists.  That decision is vested in other tenured officersthe Commissionerswho are not subject to the Presidents direct control.  Because the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Boards conduct.  He can only review the Commissioners determination of whether the Acts rigorous good-cause standard is met.  And if the President disagrees with that determination, he is powerless to interveneunless the determination is so unreasonable as to constitute inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  Humphreys Executor, supra, at 620.


This arrangement contradicts Article IIs vesting of the executive power in the President.  Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Boards failings to those whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Boards conduct.  He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board members breach of faith.  If this dispersion of responsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure.  Such diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the blame for a pernicious measure should fall.  The Acts restrictions are therefore incompatible with the Constitutions separation of powers.  Pp.1417.


(c)The fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736.  The Acts multilevel tenure protections provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.  Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive offices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence.  The Framers created a structure in which [a] dependence on the people would be the primary controul on the government, and that dependence is maintained by giving each branch the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349.  A key constitutional means vested in the President was the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.  1 Annals of Congress 463.  While a government of opposite and rival interests may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No. 51, at 349, [t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.  Bowsher, supra, at 730.  Pp.1721.


(d)The Government errs in arguing that, even if some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the Constitution, the restrictions here do not.  There is no construction of the Commissions good-cause removal power that is broad enough to avoid invalidation.  Nor is the Commissions broad power over Board functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members.  Altering the Boards budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it.  Moreover, the Commissions power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of the Commission.  Enacting new SEC rules through the required notice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micromanaging the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions.  Finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of good-cause removal.  Pp.2127.


3.The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.  Because [t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions, Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commn of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the normal rule is that partial  invalidation is the required course, Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504.  The Boards existence does not violate the separation of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by 7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do.  Concluding that the removal restrictions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will.  With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains fully operative as a law, New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186, and nothing in the Acts text or historical context makes it evident that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684.  The consequence is that the Board may continue to function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the Commission.  Pp.2729.


4.The Boards appointment is consistent with the Appointments Clause.  Pp. 2933.


(a)The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in a Hea[d] of Departmen[t].  Inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by superiors appointed by the President with the Senates consent.  Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662663.  Because the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members at will, in addition to its other oversight authority.  Board members are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission.  Pp. 2930.


(b)The Commission is a Departmen[t] under the Appointments Clause.  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifically reserved the question whether a principal agenc[y], such as the SEC, is a Departmen[t].  The Court now adopts the reasoning of the concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that the SEC is such a Departmen[t] because it is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within any other such component.  This reading is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a department; with the early practice of Congress, see 3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Courts cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.  Pp. 3031.


(c)The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the Commissions Hea[d].  The Commissions powers are generally vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.  The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative functions subject to the full Commissions policies.  There is no reason why a multimember body may not be the Hea[d] of a Departmen[t] that it governs.  The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the Courts of Law, Art.II, 2, cl.2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers collectively, see, e.g., Art.I, 2, cl.5.  Practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.  Pp.3133.

09-158|"MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON, WARDEN, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 09158.Argued March 24, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
Petitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder.  After the Alabama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, he sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court conditionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be released or resentenced.  The state trial court sentenced him to death a second time.  He filed another federal habeas application, challenging this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance during the resentencing proceeding.  The District Court once again conditionally granted the writ.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwoods challenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable second or successive challenge under 28 U. S.C. 2244(b) because he could have raised his fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.
Held:The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.
555 F.3d 968, reversed and remanded.
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IVB, concluding that because Magwoods habeas application challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not second or successive under 2244(b).  Pp.815, 1722. 


(a)This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a second or successive habeas corpus application.  2244(b)(1), (2).  The State contends that 2244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present.  Under this one opportunity rule, Magwoods fair-warning claim was second and successive because he had an opportunity to raise it in his first application but did not.  Magwood counters that 2244(b) should not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment intervening between habeas applications.  This Court agrees.  The phrase second or successive is not defined by AEDPA and it is a term of art.  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486.  To determine its meaning, the Court looks first to the statutory context.  Section 2244(b)s limitations apply only to a habeas corpus application under 2254, i.e., an application on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, 2254(b)(1).  Both 2254(b)s text and the relief it provides indicate that second or successive must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.  A 2254 petitioner seeks invalidation  of the judgment authorizing [his] confinement, Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83.  If a conditional writ is granted, the State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding).  Ibid.  The State errs in contending that, if 2254 is relevant at all, custody and not judgment, is the proper reference because unlawful custody is the substance requirement for habeas relief.  This argument is unpersuasive.  Section 2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under 2254.  Because 2254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state-court judgment, that judgment is inextricable and essential to relief.  It is a requirement that distinguishes 2254 from other statutes permitting constitutional relief.  See, e.g., 2255, 2241.  The States custody-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying second or successive to any subsequent application filed before a prisoners release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy 2244(b)s strict rules to challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time.  Nothing in the statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result.  Pp.813.


(b)This Court is also not convinced by the States argument that a one opportunity rule would be consistent with the statute and should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPAs purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.  AEDPA uses second or successive to modify application, not claim as the State contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of 2244(b) that would elid[e] the difference between an application and a claim, Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9.  The States reading also reflects a more fundamental error.  It would undermine or render superfluous much of 2244(b)(2).  In some circumstances, it would increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where 2244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions.  In others, it would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where 2244(b) mandates stricter requirements.  Pp.1315.


(c)This Courts interpretation of 2244(b) is consistent with its precedents.  Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State invokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies second or successive to an application challenging a new judgment, these cases shed no light on the question presented here.  Nor do post-AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here.  Only Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is second or successive if it challenges a new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive.  In holding that both of the petitioners habeas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Burton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment intervening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been different.  Here, there is such an intervening judgment.  This is Magwoods first application challenging that intervening judgment.  Magwood challenges not the trial courts error in his first sentencing, but the courts new error when it conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh.  Pp.15, 1721.


(d)Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the States objection that this reading of 2244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original, undisturbed conviction.  Nor does the Court address whether Magwoods fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  Pp.2122.

09-559|"DOE etal. v. REED, WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09559.Argued April 28, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
The Washington Constitution allows citizens to challenge state laws by referendum.  To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a petition with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of registered Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.  A valid submission requires not only a signature, but also the signers address and the county in which he is registered to vote. 


In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law Senate Bill 5688, which expanded the rights and responsibilities of state-registered domestic partners, including same-sex domestic partners.  That same month, Protect Marriage Washington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as a State Political Committee for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures necessary to place a referendum challenging SB 5688 on the ballot.  If the referendum made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to encourage voters to reject SB 5688.  Protect Marriage Washington submitted the petition with more than 137,000 signatures to the secretary of state, and after conducting the verification and canvassing process required by state law, the secretary determined that the petition contained sufficient signatures to qualify the referendum (R71) for the ballot.  Respondent intervenors invoked the Washington Public Records Act (PRA) to obtain copies of the petition, which contained the signers names and addresses. 


The R71 petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint and a motion for injunctive relief in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin the public release of the petition.  Count I alleges that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions, and Count II alleges that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition because there is a reasonable probability that the signatories  will be subjected to threats, harassment, and reprisals.  Determining that the PRA burdened core political speech, the District Court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of Count I and granted a preliminary injunction preventing release of the signatory information.  Reviewing only Count I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions in general, and therefore reversed.
Held:Disclosure of referendum petitions does not as a general matter violate the First Amendment.  Pp.413.
(a)Because plaintiffs Count I claim and the relief that would followan injunction barring the secretary of state from releasing referendum petitions to the publicreach beyond the particular circumstances of these plaintiffs, they must satisfy this Courts standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.  See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.45.


(b)The compelled disclosure of signatory information on referendum petitions is subject to review under the First Amendment.  In most cases, the individuals signature will express the view that the law subject to the petition should be overturned.  Even if the signer is agnostic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature still expresses the political view that the question should be considered by the whole electorate.  Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421.  In either case, the expression of a political view implicates a First Amendment right. 


Petition signing remains expressive even when it has legal effect in the electoral process.  But that does not mean that the electoral context is irrelevant to the nature of this Courts First Amendment review.  States have significant flexibility in implementing their own voting systems.  To the extent a regulation concerns the legal effect of a particular activity in that process, the government is afforded substantial latitude to enforce that regulation.  Also pertinent is the fact that the PRA is not a prohibition on speech, but a disclosure requirement that may burden the ability to speak, but [does] not prevent anyone from speaking.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 558 U. S. ___, ___.  This Court has reviewed First Amendment challenges to disclosure requirements in the electoral context under an exacting scrutiny standard, requiring a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.  Id., at ___.  To withstand this scrutiny, the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.  Davis v. Federal Election Commn, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.57.


(c)The States interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is unconstitutional with respect to referendum petitions in general.  That interest is particularly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud.  But the States interest is not limited to combating fraud; it extends to efforts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud but by simple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or signatures of individuals who are not registered to vote in the State.  The States interest also extends more generally to promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process. 


Plaintiffs contend that disclosure is not sufficiently related to the interest of protecting the integrity of the electoral process to withstand First Amendment scrutiny.  They argue that disclosure is not necessary because the secretary of state is already charged with verifying and canvassing the names on a petition, a measures advocates and opponents can observe that process, any citizen can challenge the secretarys actions in court, and criminal penalties reduce the danger of fraud in the petition process.  But the secretarys verification and canvassing will not catch all the invalid signatures, and public disclosure can help cure the inadequacies of the secretarys process.  Disclosure also helps prevent difficult-to-detect fraud such as outright forgery and bait and switch fraud, in which an individual signs the petition based on a misrepresentation of the underlying issue.  And disclosure promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral process to an extent other measures cannot.  Pp.810.


(d)Plaintiffs main objection is that the strength of the governmental interest does not reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.  Davis, supra, at ___.  According to plaintiffs, the objective of those seeking disclosure is not to prevent fraud, but to publicly identify signatories and broadcast their political views on the subject of the petition.  Plaintiffs allege, for example, that several groups plan to post the petitions in searchable form on the Internet, and then encourage other citizens to seek out R71 petition signers.  That, plaintiffs argue, would subject them to threats, harassment, and reprisals. 


The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests almost entirely on the specific harm that would attend the disclosure of information on the R71 petition.  But the question before the Court at this stage of the litigation is whether disclosure of referendum petitions in general violates the First Amendment.  Faced with the States unrebutted arguments that only modest burdens attend the disclosure of a typical petition, plaintiffs broad challenge to the PRA must be rejected.  But upholding the PRA against a broad-based challenge does not foreclose success on plaintiffs narrower challenge in Count II, which is pending before the District Court.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74.  Pp.1013.

			"|"DOE etal. v. REED, WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09559.Argued April 28, 2010Decided June 24, 2010
The Washington Constitution allows citizens to challenge state laws by referendum.  To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a petition with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of registered Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.  A valid submission requires not only a signature, but also the signers address and the county in which he is registered to vote. 


In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law Senate Bill 5688, which expanded the rights and responsibilities of state-registered domestic partners, including same-sex domestic partners.  That same month, Protect Marriage Washington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as a State Political Committee for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures necessary to place a referendum challenging SB 5688 on the ballot.  If the referendum made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to encourage voters to reject SB 5688.  Protect Marriage Washington submitted the petition with more than 137,000 signatures to the secretary of state, and after conducting the verification and canvassing process required by state law, the secretary determined that the petition contained sufficient signatures to qualify the referendum (R71) for the ballot.  Respondent intervenors invoked the Washington Public Records Act (PRA) to obtain copies of the petition, which contained the signers names and addresses. 


The R71 petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint and a motion for injunctive relief in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin the public release of the petition.  Count I alleges that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions, and Count II alleges that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition because there is a reasonable probability that the signatories  will be subjected to threats, harassment, and reprisals.  Determining that the PRA burdened core political speech, the District Court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of Count I and granted a preliminary injunction preventing release of the signatory information.

08-1553|"KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. etal. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081553.Argued March 24, 2010Decided June 21, 2010*
Respondents (cargo owners) delivered to petitioners in No. 081553 (K Line) goods for shipping from China to inland United States destinations.  K Line issued them four through bills of lading, i.e., bills of lading covering both the ocean and inland portions of transport in a single document.  As relevant here, the bills contain a Himalaya Clause, which extends the bills defenses and liability limitations to subcontractors; permit K Line to subcontract to complete the journey; provide that the entire journey is governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which regulates bills of lading issued by ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade; and designate a Tokyo court as the venue for any dispute.  K Line arranged the journey, subcontracting with petitioner in No. 081554 (Union Pacific) for rail shipment in the United States.  The cargo was shipped in K Line vessels to California and then loaded onto a Union Pacific train.  A derailment along the inland route allegedly destroyed the cargo.  Ultimately, the Federal District Court granted the motion of Union Pacific and K Line to dismiss the cargo owners suits against them based on the parties Tokyo forum-selection clause.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that that clause was trumped by the Carmack Amendment governing bills of lading issued by domestic rail carriers, which applied to the inland portion of the shipment.  
Held:Because the Carmack Amendment does not apply to a shipment originating overseas under a single through bill of lading, the parties agreement to litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding.  Pp.421.
(a)COGSA, which K Line and Union Pacific contend governs these cases, requires a carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill containing specified terms.  It does not limit the parties ability to adopt forum-selection clauses.  It only applies to shipments from United States ports to foreign ports and vice versa, but permits parties to extend certain of its terms by contract to cover the entire period in which [the goods] would be under [a carriers] responsibility, including [a] period of inland  transport.  Norfolk Southern R.Co. v. James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 29.  The Carmack Amendment, on which respondents rely, requires a domestic rail carrier that receives [property] for transportation under this part to issue a bill of lading.  49 U. S.C. 11706(a).  [T]his part refers to the Surface Transportation Boards (STBs) jurisdiction over domestic rail transportation.  See 10501(b).  Carmack assigns liability for damage on the rail route to receiving rail carrier[s] and delivering rail carrier[s], regardless of which carrier caused the damage.  11706(a).  Its purpose is to relieve cargo owners of the burden of searching out a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carriers handling an interstate shipment of goods.  Reider v. Thompson, 339 U. S. 113, 119.  Thus, it constrains carriers ability to limit liability by contract, 11706(c), and limits the parties choice of venue to federal and state courts.  11706(d)(1).  Pp.47.


(b)In Kirby, as in these cases, an ocean shipping company issued a through bill of lading that extended COGSAs terms to the inland segment, and the property was damaged during the inland rail portion.  This Court held that the through bills terms governed under federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws, 543 U. S., at 2327, explaining that so long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce, id., at 27, and adding that [a]pplying state law  would undermine the uniformity of general maritime law, id., at 28, and defeat COGSAs apparent purpose to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea, ibid.  Here, as in Kirby, K Line issued through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce, and extended its terms to the journeys inland domestic segment.  Pp.78.


(c)The Carmack Amendments text, history, and purposes make clear that it does not require a different result.  Pp.821.


(1)Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into receiving, delivering, and connecting rail carriers.  Its first sentence requires a compliant bill of lading (1) if a rail carrier provid[es] transportation or service subject to the [STBs] jurisdiction and (2) if that carrier receives the property for transportation .  11706(a).  It thus requires the receiving rail carrierbut not the delivering or connecting rail carrierto issue a bill of lading.  This conclusion is consistent with statutes text and this Courts precedent.  See St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 595, 604.  A receiving rail carrier is the initial carrier, which receives the property for domestic rail transportation at the journeys point of origin.  If the Carmacks bill of lading requirement referred not to the initial carrier, but to any carrier receiving the property from another carrier, then every carrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill.  This would be contrary to Carmacks purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill for damage caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.  This conclusion is consistent with Mexican Light & Power Co. v. Texas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, where the Court held that a bill of lading issued by a subsequent rail carrier when the initial carrier has issued a through bill is void unless it represents the initiation of a new shipment, id., at 733734.  And Reider, supra, is not to the contrary.  There, absent a through bill of lading, the original journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans, and the first rail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier for Carmack purposes.  Id., at 117.  Carmacks second sentence establishes that it applies only to transport of property for which a receiving carrier is required to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether that carrier actually issues such a bill.  See 11706(a).  Thus, Carmack applies only if the journey begins with a receiving rail carrier that had to issue a compliant bill of lading, not if the property is received at an overseas location under a through bill that covers transport into an inland location in this country.  The initial carrier in that instance receives the property at the shipments point of origin for overseas multimodal import transport, not domestic rail transport.  Carmack did not require K Line to issue bills of lading because K Line was not a receiving rail carrier.  That it chose to use rail transport to complete one segment of the journey under its essentially maritime contracts, Kirby, supra, at 24, does not put it within Carmacks reach.  Union Pacific, which the cargo owners concede was a mere delivering carrier that did not have to issue its own Carmack bill of lading, was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack.  Because the Ninth Circuit ignored Carmacks receive[d]  for transportation limitation, it reached the wrong conclusion.  Its conclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmacks venue provisions, which presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a judicial district within the United States.  If K Line were a receiving carrier in a case with a point of origin in China, there would be no place under Carmack to sue K Line, since China is not within a judicial district of the United States or in a State Court.  11706(d)(1).  Pp.815.


(2)Carmacks statutory history supports this conclusion.  None of its legislative versionsthe original 1906 statute or the amended 1915, 1978, or 1995 oneshave applied to the inland domestic rail segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.  Pp.1517.


(3)This interpretation also attains the most consistency between Carmack and COGSA.  Applying Carmack to the inland segment of an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill would undermine Carmacks purposes, which are premised on the view that a shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage is the responsibility of both receiving and delivering carriers.  Under the Ninth Circuits interpretation, there might be no venue in which to sue the receiving carrier.  That interpretation would also undermine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal transport: COGSAs liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is damaged at sea and Carmacks rules almost always would apply when the damage occurs on land.  Moreover, applying Carmack to international import shipping transport would undermine COGSAs purpose to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea.  Kirby, supra, at 29.  The cargo owners contrary policy arguments are unavailing.  Pp.1720.

(c)The Carmack Amendments text, history, and purposes make clear that it does not require a different result.  Pp.821.


(1)Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into receiving, delivering, and connecting rail carriers.  Its first sentence requires a compliant bill of lading (1) if a rail carrier provid[es] transportation or service subject to the [STBs] jurisdiction and (2) if that carrier receives the property for transportation .  11706(a).  It thus requires the receiving rail carrierbut not the delivering or connecting rail carrierto issue a bill of lading.  This conclusion is consistent with statutes text and this Courts precedent.  See St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 595, 604.  A receiving rail carrier is the initial carrier, which receives the property for domestic rail transportation at the journeys point of origin.  If the Carmacks bill of lading requirement referred not to the initial carrier, but to any carrier receiving the property from another carrier, then every carrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill.  This would be contrary to Carmacks purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill for damage caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.  This conclusion is consistent with Mexican Light & Power Co. v. Texas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, where the Court held that a bill of lading issued by a subsequent rail carrier when the initial carrier has issued a through bill is void unless it represents the initiation of a new shipment, id., at 733734.  And Reider, supra, is not to the contrary.  There, absent a through bill of lading, the original journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans, and the first rail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier for Carmack purposes.  Id., at 117.  Carmacks second sentence establishes that it applies only to transport of property for which a receiving carrier is required to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether that carrier actually issues such a bill.  See 11706(a).  Thus, Carmack applies only if the journey begins with a receiving rail carrier that had to issue a compliant bill of lading, not if the property is received at an overseas location under a through bill that covers transport into an inland location in this country.  The initial carrier in that instance receives the property at the shipments point of origin for overseas multimodal import transport, not domestic rail transport.  Carmack did not require K Line to issue bills of lading because K Line was not a receiving rail carrier.  That it chose to use rail transport to complete one segment of the journey under its essentially maritime contracts, Kirby, supra, at 24, does not put it within Carmacks reach.  Union Pacific, which the cargo owners concede was a mere delivering carrier that did not have to issue its own Carmack bill of lading, was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack.  Because the Ninth Circuit ignored Carmacks receive[d]  for transportation limitation, it reached the wrong conclusion.  Its conclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmacks venue provisions, which presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a judicial district within the United States.  If K Line were a receiving carrier in a case with a point of origin in China, there would be no place under Carmack to sue K Line, since China is not within a judicial district of the United States or in a State Court.  11706(d)(1).  Pp.815.


(2)Carmacks statutory history supports this conclusion.  None of its legislative versionsthe original 1906 statute or the amended 1915, 1978, or 1995 oneshave applied to the inland domestic rail segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.  Pp.1517.

Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theories accounting for the verdict.  Defendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general verdict.  The Government ultimately acquiesced.  The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alternative theories.  As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the jury, over Defendants timely objection, that a person commits that offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loyalty.  The jury returned general verdicts of guilty on the mail-fraud counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.  


On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services-fraud jury instructions.  Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convictions, Defendants relied on Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 312, which held that a general verdict may be set aside where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.  The Seventh Circuit found no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not prevail.  By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms, the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objection to the instructions.  Their challenge would have become moot, the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms separating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud.  Defendants, the Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the obscurity of the jurys verdict.
Held: 
1.In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, this Court vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services component of the federal mail-fraud statute, 1346, criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.  That holding renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.  P. 5.


2.By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal.  They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict forms.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special questions to the jury.  In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 provides for jury interrogatories of two kinds:special verdicts, Rule 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule 49(b).  While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they are informative on objections to instructions.  Criminal Rule 30(d) provides that a party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.  Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.  The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a further requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury instructions.  It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule.  And it placed in the prosecutors hands authority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.  To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Governments special-verdict request.  Criminal Rule 57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention.  It provides: No sanction  may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law [or] federal rules  unless the alleged violator was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.  Pp.58.


3.As in Skilling, the Court expresses no opinion on whether the honest-services instructional error was ultimately harmless, but leaves that matter for consideration on remand.  P.8.

09-475|"MONSANTO CO. etal. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09475.Argued April 27, 2010Decided June 21, 2010
The Plant Protection Act (PPA) provides that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture may issue regulations to prevent the introduction of plant pests into the United States or the dissemination of plant pests within the United States.  7 U. S.C. 7711(a).  Pursuant to that grant of authority, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) promulgated regulations that presume genetically engineered plants to be plant pestsand thus regulated articles under the PPAuntil APHIS determines otherwise.  However, any person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated article does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the applicable regulations.  APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in part. 


In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a genetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) for every  major Federal actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.  42 U. S.C. 4332(2)(C).  The agency need not complete an EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environmental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a significant environmental impact. 


This case involves a challenge to APHISs decision to approve the unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a variety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the herbicide Roundup.  Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the intellectual property rights to RRA.  In response to petitioners deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public comments on its proposed course of action.  Based on its EA and the comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environment.  Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and without preparing an EIS.  Respondents, conventional alfalfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal laws.  The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS.  To remedy that violation, the court vacated the agencys decision completely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a nationwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process.  Petitioners and the Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but not disputing that APHISs deregulation decision violated NEPA.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHISs proposed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.  
Held: 
1.Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Courts review of the Ninth Circuits judgment affirming the entry of such relief.  Pp.714.


(a)Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.  Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling.  See Horne v. Flores, 557 U. S. ___, ___.  Petitioners satisfy all three criteria.  Petitioners are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective customers until APHIS completes the EIS.  Because that injury is caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on appeal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court.  Respondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing because their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of the District Courts order that petitioners failed to challenge, the vacatur of APHISs deregulation decision.  That argument fails for two independent reasons.  First, one of the main disputes between the parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District Court should have adopted APHISs proposed judgment, which would have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order expressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA.  Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted APHISs proposed judgment, there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwithstanding the District Courts vacatur, because there would, in effect, be a new deregulation decision.  Second, petitioners in any case have standing to challenge the part of the District Courts order enjoining a partial deregulation.  Respondents focus their argument on the part of the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states that before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the agency must prepare an EIS.  That part of the judgment inflicts an injury not also caused by the vacatur.  Pp.711. 


(b)Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief from the complete deregulation order at issue here.  The Court disagrees with petitioners argument that respondents have failed to show that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.  The District Court found that respondent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their conventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered Roundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated.  A substantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways that are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the constitutional standing analysis.  Moreover, those harms are readily attributable to APHISs deregulation decision, which gives rise to a significant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa varieties.  Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregulation of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress respondents injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow to their crops.  Pp.1114.


2.The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of RRA pending the agencys completion of its detailed environmental review.  Pp.1422.


(a)Because petitioners and the Government do not argue otherwise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in vacating the agencys decision to completely deregulate RRA.  The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohibiting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS, and the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting during the pendency of the EIS process.  P.14. 


(b)Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the  plaintiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U. S. 388, 391.  This test fully applies in NEPA cases.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___.  Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and should be granted absent unusual circumstances.  Pp.1516.  


(c)None of the four factors supports the District Courts order enjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency of the EIS process.  Most importantly, respondents cannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons.  First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate preliminary relief.  Accordingly, a permanent injunction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable harm.  Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent.  Indeed, the broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of environmental harm.  Pp.1623. 


(d)The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide injunction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons.  First, because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a deregulation decision.  Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312.  If, as respondents now concede, a less drastic remedy (such as partial or complete vacatur of APHISs deregulation decision) was sufficient to redress their injury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an injunction was warranted.  Pp.2324. 


(e)Given the District Courts errors, this Court need not address whether injunctive relief of some kind was available to respondents on the record below.  Pp.2425.
570 F.3d 1130, reversed and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.  Breyer, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

09-497|"RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09497.Argued April 26, 2010Decided June 21, 2010
Respondent Jackson filed an employment-discrimination suit against petitioner Rent-A-Center, his former employer, in a Nevada Federal District Court.  Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S.C. 3, and to compel arbitration, 4, based on the arbitration agreement (Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment.  Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unenforceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law.  The District Court granted Rent-A-Centers motion.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. 
Held:Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator.  Pp.312.  
(a)Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478, save upon such grounds as exist under law or in equity for the revocation of any contract, 2.  Here, the Agreement included two relevant arbitration provisions: it provided for arbitration of all disputes arising out of Jacksons employment, including discrimination claims, and it gave the Arbitrator  exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the [Agreements] enforceability  including  any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.  Rent-A-Center seeks enforcement of the second provision, which delegates to the arbitrator the gateway question of enforceability.  See, e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 8385.  The court must enforce the delegation provision under 3 and 4 unless it is unenforceable under 2.  Pp.36.


(b)There are two types of validity challenges under 2: one challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, and [t]he other challenges the contract as a whole, Buckeye, supra, at 444.  Only the first is relevant to a courts determination of an arbitration agreements enforceability, see, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403404, because under 2 an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract, Buckeye, supra, at 445.  That does not mean that agreements to arbitrate are unassailable.  If a party challenges the validity under 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the agreement under 4.  That is no less true when the precise agreement to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement.  Because here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be treated as valid under 2 and enforced under 3 and 4.  Pp.69.


(c)The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.  In his brief to this Court he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time, but that is too late and will not be considered.  See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.912.
581 F.3d 912, reversed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09497.Argued April 26, 2010Decided June 21, 2010
Respondent Jackson filed an employment-discrimination suit against petitioner Rent-A-Center, his former employer, in a Nevada Federal District Court.  Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S.C. 3, and to compel arbitration, 4, based on the arbitration agreement (Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment.  Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unenforceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law.  The District Court granted Rent-A-Centers motion.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. 
Held:Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator.  Pp.312.  
(a)Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478, save upon such grounds as exist under law or in equity for the revocation of any contract, 2.  Here, the Agreement included two relevant arbitration provisions: it provided for arbitration of all disputes arising out of Jacksons employment, including discrimination claims, and it gave the Arbitrator  exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the [Agreements] enforceability  including  any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.  Rent-A-Center seeks enforcement of the second provision, which delegates to the arbitrator the gateway question of enforceability.  See, e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 8385.  The court must enforce the delegation provision under 3 and 4 unless it is unenforceable under 2.  Pp.36.


(b)There are two types of validity challenges under 2: one challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, and [t]he other challenges the contract as a whole, Buckeye, supra, at 444.  Only the first is relevant to a courts determination of an arbitration agreements enforceability, see, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403404, because under 2 an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract, Buckeye, supra, at 445.  That does not mean that agreements to arbitrate are unassailable.  If a party challenges the validity under 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the agreement under 4.  That is no less true when the precise agreement to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement.  Because here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be treated as valid under 2 and enforced under 3 and 4.  Pp.69.


(c)The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.  In his brief to this Court he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time, but that is too late and will not be considered.  See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.912.
581 F.3d 912, reversed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined."|
08-1151|"STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 081151.Argued December 2, 2009Decided June 17, 2010
Florida owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore.  The mean high-water line is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral property, and state-owned land.  Littoral owners have, inter alia, rights to have access to the water, to use the water for certain purposes, to have an unobstructed view of the water, and to receive accretions and relictions (collectively, accretions) to the littoral property.  An accretion occurs gradually and imperceptibly, while a sudden change is an avulsion.  The littoral owner automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion.  With avulsion, however, the seaward boundary of littoral property remains what it was: the mean high-water line before the event.  Thus, when an avulsion has added new land, the littoral owner has no right to subsequent accretions, because the property abutting the water belongs to the owner of the seabed (ordinarily the State).


Floridas Beach and Shore Preservation Act establishes procedures for depositing sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and maintaining the deposited sand (nourishment).  When such a project is undertaken, the State entity that holds title to the seabed sets a fixed erosion control line to replace the fluctuating mean high-water line as the boundary between littoral and state property.  Once the new line is recorded, the common law ceases to apply.  Thereafter, when accretion moves the mean high-water line seaward, the littoral property remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line.


Respondents the city of Destin and Walton County sought permits to restore 6.9 miles of beach eroded by several hurricanes, adding about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be denominated the erosion-control line).  Petitioner, a nonprofit corporation formed by owners of beachfront property bordering the project (hereinafter Members) brought an unsuccessful administrative challenge.  Respondent the Florida Department of Environmental Protection approved the permits, and this suit followed.  The State Court of Appeal concluded that the Departments order had eliminated the Members littoral rights (1) to receive accretions to their property and (2) to have their propertys contact with the water remain intact.  Concluding that this would be an unconstitutional taking and would require an additional administrative requirement to be met, it set aside the order, remanded the proceeding, and certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question whether the Act unconstitutionally deprived the Members of littoral rights without just compensation.  The State Supreme Court answered no and quashed the remand, concluding that the Members did not own the property supposedly taken.  Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the Florida Supreme Courts decision effected a taking of the Members littoral rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; rehearing was denied.
Held:The judgment is affirmed.  
998 So.2d 1102, affirmed.
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IV, and V, concluding that the Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.2429.


(a)Respondents arguments that petitioner does not own the property and that the case is not ripe were not raised in the briefs in opposition and thus are deemed waived.  Pp. 2425.


(b)There can be no taking unless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Supreme Courts decision, littoral property owners had rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to the States right to fill in its submerged land.  That showing cannot be made.  Two core Florida property-law principles intersect here.  First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public and of littoral landowners.  Second, if an avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it interrupts the littoral owners contact with the water.  Prior Florida law suggests that there is no exception to this rule when the State causes the avulsion.  Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for ownership purposes.  The right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the States right to fill. Pp.2527.


(c)The decision below is consistent with these principles.  Cf. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 10281029.  It did not abolish the Members right to future accretions, but merely held that the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project because of the doctrine of avulsion.  Relying on dicta in the Florida Supreme Courts Sand Key decision, petitioner contends that the State took the Members littoral right to have the boundary always be the mean high-water line.  But petitioners interpretation of that dictum contradicts the clear law governing avulsion.  One cannot say the Florida Supreme Court contravened established property law by rejecting it.  Pp.2729. 


Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded in Parts II and III that if a court declares that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists, it has taken that property in violation of the Takings Clause.  Pp.724.


(a)Though the classic taking is a transfer of property by eminent domain, the Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing, including those that recharacterize as public property what was previously private property, see Webbs Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163165.  The Clause is not addressed to the action of a specific branch or branches.  It is concerned simply with the act, not with the governmental actor.  This Courts precedents provide no support for the proposition that takings effected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment, and in fact suggest the contrary.  See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, Webbs Fabulous Pharmacies, supra.  Pp.720.


(b)For a judicial taking, respondents would add to the normal takings inquiry the requirement that the courts decision have no fair and substantial basis.  This test is not obviously appropriate, but it is no different in this context from the requirement that the property owner prove an established property right.  Respondents additional argumentsthat federal courts lack the knowledge of state law required to decide whether a state judicial decision purporting to clarify property rights has instead taken them; that common-law judging should not be deprived of needed flexibility; and that applying the Takings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts to review final state-court judgments, in violation of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, see Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 415416, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462, 476are unpersuasive.  And petitioners proposed unpredictability testthat a judicial taking consists of a decision that constitutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents, Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (Stewart, J., concurring)is misdirected.  What counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the property right allegedly taken was well established.  Pp.2024. 


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Sotomayor, agreed that the Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensation, but concluded that this case does not require the Court to determine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining property owners rights can violate the Takings Clause.  If and when future cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional ones that constrain the judiciary like due process, are inadequate to protect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision can effect a taking would be properly presented.  Pp.110.


Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg, agreed that no unconstitutional taking occurred here, but concluded that it is unnecessary to decide more than that to resolve this case.  Difficult questions of constitutional lawe.g., whether federal courts may review a state courts decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private property without compensation, and what the proper test is for evaluating whether a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitutional takingneed not be addressed in order to dispose of the immediate case. Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R.Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373.  Such questions are better left for another day.  Pp.13.
Scalia, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IV, and V, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and III, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined.

08-1332|"CITY OF ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA, etal. v. QUON etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081332.Argued April 19, 2010Decided June 17, 2010
Petitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers able to send and receive text messages.  Its contract with its service provider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number of characters each pager could send or receive, and specified that usage exceeding that number would result in an additional fee.  The City issued the pagers to respondent Quon and other officers in its police department (OPD), also a petitioner here.  When Quon and others exceeded their monthly character limits for several months running, petitioner Scharf, OPDs chief, sought to determine whether the existing limit was too low, i.e., whether the officers had to pay fees for sending work-related messages or, conversely, whether the overages were for personal messages.  After Arch Wireless provided transcripts of Quons and another employees August and September 2002 text messages, it was discovered that many of Quons messages were not work related, and some were sexually explicit.  Scharf referred the matter to OPDs internal affairs division.  The investigating officer used Quons work schedule to redact from his transcript any messages he sent while off duty, but the transcript showed that few of his on-duty messages related to police business.  Quon was disciplined for violating OPD rules.


He and the other respondentseach of whom had exchanged text messages with Quon during August and Septemberfiled this suit, alleging, inter alia, that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Quons pager messages, and that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.  The District Court denied respondents summary judgment on the constitutional claims, relying on the plurality opinion in OConnor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his messages.  Whether the audit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work-related costs.  After the jury concluded that Scharfs intent was legitimate, the court granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Although it agreed that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reasonable even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related rationale.  The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than the audit that Scharf could have used.  The court further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.     
Held:Because the search of Quons text messages was reasonable, petitioners did not violate respondents Fourth Amendment rights, and the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise.  Pp. 717.
(a)The Amendment guarantees a persons privacy, dignity, and security against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function.  Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613614.  It applies as well when the government acts in its capacity as an employer.  Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665.  The Members of the OConnor Court disagreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against government employers.  A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct analysis has two steps.  First, because some [government] offices may be so open  that no expectation of privacy is reasonable, a court must consider [t]he operational realities of the workplace to determine if an employees constitutional rights are implicated.  480 U. S., at 718.  Second, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employers intrusion on that expectation for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.  Id., at 725726.  Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment, would have dispensed with the operational realities inquiry and concluded that the offices of government employees  are [generally] covered by Fourth Amendment protections, id., at 731, but he would also have held that government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rulessearches of the sort that are regarded as  reasonable and normal in the private-employer contextdo not violate the  Amendment, id., at 732.  Pp. 79. 


(b)Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both OConnor approaches, the pluralitys and Justice Scalias.  Pp. 917.


(1)The Court does not resolve the parties disagreement over Quons privacy expectation.  Prudence counsels caution before the facts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees using employer-provided communication devices.  Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior.  At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the laws treatment of them, will evolve.  Because it is therefore preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court assumes, arguendo, that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expectation; (2) petitioners review of the transcript constituted a Fourth Amendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government employers search of an employees physical office apply as well in the electronic sphere.  Pp. 912.  


(2)Petitioners warrantless review of Quons pager transcript was reasonable under the OConnor pluralitys approach because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope.  See 480 U. S., at 726.  There were reasonable grounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose, ibid., in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to determine whether the Citys contractual character limit was sufficient to meet the Citys needs.  It was also reasonably related to the objectives of the search, ibid., because both the City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the other hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal communications.  Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused Quons overages.  And the review was also not excessively intrusive.  Ibid.  Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September 2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character limits efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off duty were redacted.  And from OPDs perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quons life.  Similarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the search would be regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context and thereby satisfy the approach of Justice Scalias concurrence, id., at 732.  Conversely, the Ninth Circuits least intrusive means approach was inconsistent with controlling precedents.  See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 663.  Pp. 1216. 


(c)Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.  They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to them.  Given this litigating position and the Courts conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these other respondents cannot prevail.  Pp.1617.

S. 709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his messages.  Whether the audit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work-related costs.  After the jury concluded that Scharfs intent was legitimate, the court granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Although it agreed that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reasonable even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related rationale.  The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than the audit that Scharf could have used.  The court further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.     
Held:Because the search of Quons text messages was reasonable, petitioners did not violate respondents Fourth Amendment rights, and the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise.  Pp. 717.
(a)The Amendment guarantees a persons privacy, dignity, and security against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function.  Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613614.  It applies as well when the government acts in its capacity as an employer.  Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665.  The Members of the OConnor Court disagreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against government employers.  A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct analysis has two steps.  First, because some [government] offices may be so open  that no expectation of privacy is reasonable, a court must consider [t]he operational realities of the workplace to determine if an employees constitutional rights are implicated.  480 U. S., at 718.  Second, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employers intrusion on that expectation for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.  Id., at 725726.  Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment, would have dispensed with the operational realities inquiry and concluded that the offices of government employees  are [generally] covered by Fourth Amendment protections, id., at 731, but he would also have held that government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rulessearches of the sort that are regarded as  reasonable and normal in the private-employer contextdo not violate the  Amendment, id., at 732.  Pp. 79. 


(b)Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both OConnor approaches, the pluralitys and Justice Scalias.  Pp. 917.


(1)The Court does not resolve the parties disagreement over Quons privacy expectation.  Prudence counsels caution before the facts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees using employer-provided communication devices.  Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior.  At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the laws treatment of them, will evolve.  Because it is therefore preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court assumes, arguendo, that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expectation; (2) petitioners review of the transcript constituted a Fourth Amendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government employers search of an employees physical office apply as well in the electronic sphere.  Pp. 912.  


(2)Petitioners warrantless review of Quons pager transcript was reasonable under the OConnor pluralitys approach because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope.  See 480 U. S., at 726.  There were reasonable grounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose, ibid., in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to determine whether the Citys contractual character limit was sufficient to meet the Citys needs.  It was also reasonably related to the objectives of the search, ibid., because both the City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the other hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal communications.  Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused Quons overages.  And the review was also not excessively intrusive.  Ibid.  Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September 2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character limits efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off duty were redacted.  And from OPDs perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quons life.  Similarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the search would be regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context and thereby satisfy the approach of Justice Scalias concurrence, id., at 732.  Conversely, the Ninth Circuits least intrusive means approach was inconsistent with controlling precedents.  See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 663.  Pp. 1216. 


(c)Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.  They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to them.  Given this litigating position and the Courts conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these other respondents cannot prevail.  Pp.1617.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 081457.Argued March 23, 2010Decided June 17, 2010
The Taft-Hartley Act increased the size of the National Labor Relations Board (Board) from three members to five, see 29 U. S.C. 153(a), and amended 3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act to increase the Boards quorum requirement from two members to three and to allow the Board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three members, see 153(b).  In December 2007, the Boardfinding itself with only four members and expecting two more vacanciesdelegated, inter alia, its powers to a group of three members.  On December 31, one group members appointment expired, but the others proceeded to issue Board decisions for the next 27 months as a two-member quorum of a three-member group.  Two of those decisions sustained unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner, which sought review, challenging the two-member Boards authority to issue orders.  The Seventh Circuit ruled for the Government, concluding that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a three-member group to which the Board had legitimately delegated its powers.
Held: Section 3(b) requires that a delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the Board.  Pp.414. 
(a)The first sentence of 3(b), the so-called delegation clause, authorizes the Board to delegate its powers only to a group of three or more members.  This clause is best read to require that the delegee group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to remain valid.  First, that is the only way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of 3(b)s provisions: (1) the delegation clause; (2) the vacancy clause, which provides that [a] vacancy in the Board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the Board; (3) the Board quorum requirement, which mandates that three members of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the Board; and (4) the group quorum provision, which provides that two members shall constitute a quorum of any delegee group.  This reading is consonant with the Board quorum requirement of three participating members at all times, and it gives material effect to the delegation clauses three-member rule.  It also permits the vacancy clause to operate to provide that vacancies do not impair the Boards ability to take action, so long as the quorum is satisfied.  And it does not render inoperative the group quorum provision, which continues to authorize a properly constituted three-member delegee group to issue a decision with only two members participating when one is disqualified from a case.  The Governments contrary reading allows two members to act as the Board ad infinitum, dramatically undercutting the Board quorum requirements significance by allowing its permanent circumvention.  It also diminishes the delegation clauses three-member requirement by permitting a de facto two-member delegation.  By allowing the Board to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her term expires, this approach also gives no meaningful effect to the command implicit in both the delegation clause and the Board quorum requirement that the Boards full power be vested in no fewer than three members.  Second, had Congress intended to authorize two members to act on an ongoing basis, it could have used straightforward language.  The Courts interpretation is consistent with the Boards longstanding practice of reconstituting a delegee group when one group members term expired.  Pp.49.


(b)The Governments several arguments against the Courts interpretationthat the group quorum requirement and vacancy clause together permit two members of a three-member group to constitute a quorum even when there is no third member; that the vacancy clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect; and that reading the statute to authorize the Board to act with only two members advances the congressional objective of Board efficiencyare unconvincing.

08-1498|"HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etal. v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081498.Argued February 23, 2010Decided June 21, 2010
It is a federal crime to knowingly provid[e] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.  18 U. S.C. 2339B(a)(1).  The authority to designate an entity a foreign terrorist organization rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.  [T]he term material support or resources means any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.  2339A(b)(1).  Over the years, 2339B and the definition of material support or resources have been amended, inter alia, to clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign groups designation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts, 2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms training, 2339A(b)(2), expert advice or assistance, 2339A(b)(3), and personnel, 2339B(h).


Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated foreign terrorist organization[s] are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to establish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Although both groups engage in political and humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.  Claiming they wish to support those groups lawful, nonviolent activities, two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs) initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support statute.  The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history.  Ultimately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the material-support statute against plaintiffs.  After the Ninth Circuit affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certiorari.  The Court granted both petitions.


As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge 2339Bs prohibition on providing four types of material supporttraining, expert advice or assistance, service, and personnelasserting violations of the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause on the ground that the statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They claim that 2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK members to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.     
Held:The material-support statute, 2339B, is constitutional as applied to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist organizations.  Pp. 836.
(a)This preenforcement challenge to 2339B is a justiciable Article III case or controversy.  Plaintiffs face a credible threat of prosecution and should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.  Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298.  P. 10. 


(b)The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation by accepting plaintiffs argument that the material-support statute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organizations illegal activities.  That reading is inconsistent with 2339Bs text, which prohibits knowingly providing material support and demonstrates that Congress chose knowledge about the organizations connection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activities, as the necessary mental state for a violation.  Plaintiffs reading is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding 2339B, whichunlike 2339Bdo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.  See 2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1).  Finally, there is no textual basis for plaintiffs argument that the same language in 2339B should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but not with regard to other forms of material support.  Pp. 1012. 


(c)As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plaintiffs vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding that training, service, and a portion of expert advice or assistance were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected speechregardless of whether those applications were clear.  The Court of Appeals also contravened the rule that [a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.  Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.


The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.  United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304.  The statutory terms at issue heretraining, expert advice or assistance, service, and personnelare quite different from the sorts of terms, like annoying and indecent, that the Court has struck down for requiring wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.  Id., at 306.  Congress has increased the clarity of 2339Bs terms by adding narrowing definitions, and 2339Bs knowledge requirement further reduces any potential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.


Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dispositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plaintiffs proposed conduct.  Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage readily fall within the scope of training and expert advice or assistance.  In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used those terms to describe their own proposed activities.  Plaintiffs resort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of training and expert advice or assistance is beside the point because this litigation does not concern such situations.  See Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 223.  Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 10491051, distinguished.  Plaintiffs further contention, that the statute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish to undertake, runs afoul of 2339B(h), which makes clear that personnel does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of service, which refers to concerted activity, not independent advocacy.  Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a cause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service to a foreign terrorist organization.  2339B(a)(1).


Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage is not prohibited by 2339B.  On the other hand, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term service to cover advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.  Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a service.  Because plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454.  Pp. 1320. 


(d)As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Pp. 2034.  


(1)Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question.  Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure political speech.  That claim is unfounded because, under the material-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.  Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or membership in the PKK and LTTE.  Rather, Congress has prohibited material support, which most often does not take the form of speech.  And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.  On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the correct standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367, 377.  That standard is not used to review a content-based regulation of speech, and 2339B regulates plaintiffs speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its content.  Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.    Thus, the Court must [apply] a more demanding standard than the one described in OBrien.  Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403.  Pp. 2023.


(2)The parties agree that the Governments interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech, which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK and LTTE.  Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question.  Congress rejected plaintiffs position on that question when it enacted 2339B, finding that foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.  301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following 2339B.  The record confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs view.  The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.  It is not difficult to conclude, as Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great that working in coordination with them or at their command legitimizes and furthers their terrorist means.  Moreover, material support meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to advance terrorism in multiple ways.  The record shows that designated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational firewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or financial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and those used to carry out terrorist attacks.  Providing material support in any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to prevent terrorism and strain the United States relationships with its allies, including those that are defending themselves against violent insurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups.  Pp. 2328. 


(3)The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual inferences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive Branchs stated view that the experience and analysis of Government agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Congresss finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizationseven those for seemingly benign purposesfurther those groups terrorist activities.  That evaluation of the facts, like Congresss assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive national security and foreign relations interests at stake.  The Court does not defer to the Governments reading of the First Amendment.  But respect for the Governments factual conclusions is appropriate in light of the courts lack of expertise with respect to national security and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terrorist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to obtain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than concrete evidence.  The Court also finds it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.  Most importantly, Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.  Given the sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign terrorist groups serves the Governments interest in preventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to promote only the groups nonviolent ends.


As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is wholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use international law to resolve disputes would provide that group with information and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strategy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.  Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.  Plaintiffs proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.  The Court does not decide whether any future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny.  It simply holds that 2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide.  Pp. 2834.


(e)Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs First Amendment freedom of association.  Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Courts precedents.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected this claim because 2339B does not penalize mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist groups material support.  Any burden on plaintiffs freedom of association caused by preventing them from supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081498.Argued February 23, 2010Decided June 21, 2010
It is a federal crime to knowingly provid[e] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.  18 U. S.C. 2339B(a)(1).  The authority to designate an entity a foreign terrorist organization rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.  [T]he term material support or resources means any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.  2339A(b)(1).  Over the years, 2339B and the definition of material support or resources have been amended, inter alia, to clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign groups designation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts, 2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms training, 2339A(b)(2), expert advice or assistance, 2339A(b)(3), and personnel, 2339B(h).


Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated foreign terrorist organization[s] are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to establish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Although both groups engage in political and humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.  Claiming they wish to support those groups lawful, nonviolent activities, two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs) initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support statute.  The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history.  Ultimately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the material-support statute against plaintiffs.  After the Ninth Circuit affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certiorari.  The Court granted both petitions.


As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge 2339Bs prohibition on providing four types of material supporttraining, expert advice or assistance, service, and personnelasserting violations of the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause on the ground that the statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They claim that 2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK members to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.     
Held:The material-support statute, 2339B, is constitutional as applied to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist organizations.  Pp. 836.
(a)This preenforcement challenge to 2339B is a justiciable Article III case or controversy.  Plaintiffs face a credible threat of prosecution and should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.  Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.

(b)The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation by accepting plaintiffs argument that the material-support statute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organizations illegal activities.  That reading is inconsistent with 2339Bs text, which prohibits knowingly providing material support and demonstrates that Congress chose knowledge about the organizations connection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activities, as the necessary mental state for a violation.  Plaintiffs reading is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding 2339B, whichunlike 2339Bdo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.  See 2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1).  Finally, there is no textual basis for plaintiffs argument that the same language in 2339B should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but not with regard to other forms of material support.  Pp. 1012. 


(c)As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plaintiffs vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding that training, service, and a portion of expert advice or assistance were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected speechregardless of whether those applications were clear.  The Court of Appeals also contravened the rule that [a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.  Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.


The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.  United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304.  The statutory terms at issue heretraining, expert advice or assistance, service, and personnelare quite different from the sorts of terms, like annoying and indecent, that the Court has struck down for requiring wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.  Id., at 306.  Congress has increased the clarity of 2339Bs terms by adding narrowing definitions, and 2339Bs knowledge requirement further reduces any potential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.


Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dispositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plaintiffs proposed conduct.  Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage readily fall within the scope of training and expert advice or assistance.  In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used those terms to describe their own proposed activities.  Plaintiffs resort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of training and expert advice or assistance is beside the point because this litigation does not concern such situations.  See Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 223.  Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 10491051, distinguished.  Plaintiffs further contention, that the statute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish to undertake, runs afoul of 2339B(h), which makes clear that personnel does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of service, which refers to concerted activity, not independent advocacy.  Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a cause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service to a foreign terrorist organization.  2339B(a)(1).


Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage is not prohibited by 2339B.  On the other hand, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term service to cover advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.  Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a service.  Because plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454.  Pp. 1320. 


(d)As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Pp. 2034.  


(1)Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question.  Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure political speech.  That claim is unfounded because, under the material-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.  Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or membership in the PKK and LTTE.  Rather, Congress has prohibited material support, which most often does not take the form of speech.  And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.  On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the correct standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367, 377.  That standard is not used to review a content-based regulation of speech, and 2339B regulates plaintiffs speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its content.  Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.    Thus, the Court must [apply] a more demanding standard than the one described in OBrien.  Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403.  Pp. 2023.


(2)The parties agree that the Governments interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech, which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK and LTTE.  Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question.  Congress rejected plaintiffs position on that question when it enacted 2339B, finding that foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.  301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following 2339B.  The record confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs view.  The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.  It is not difficult to conclude, as Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great that working in coordination with them or at their command legitimizes and furthers their terrorist means.  Moreover, material support meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to advance terrorism in multiple ways.  The record shows that designated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational firewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or financial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and those used to carry out terrorist attacks.  Providing material support in any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to prevent terrorism and strain the United States relationships with its allies, including those that are defending themselves against violent insurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups.  Pp. 2328. 


(3)The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual inferences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive Branchs stated view that the experience and analysis of Government agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Congresss finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizationseven those for seemingly benign purposesfurther those groups terrorist activities.  That evaluation of the facts, like Congresss assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive national security and foreign relations interests at stake.  The Court does not defer to the Governments reading of the First Amendment.  But respect for the Governments factual conclusions is appropriate in light of the courts lack of expertise with respect to national security and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terrorist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to obtain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than concrete evidence.  The Court also finds it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.  Most importantly, Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.  Given the sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign terrorist groups serves the Governments interest in preventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to promote only the groups nonviolent ends.


As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is wholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use international law to resolve disputes would provide that group with information and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strategy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.  Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.  Plaintiffs proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.  The Court does not decide whether any future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny.  It simply holds that 2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide.  Pp. 2834.


(e)Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs First Amendment freedom of association.  Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Courts precedents.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected this claim because 2339B does not penalize mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist groups material support.  Any burden on plaintiffs freedom of association caused by preventing them from supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

09-6338|"DILLON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 096338.Argued March 30, 2010Decided June 17, 2010
In 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months imprisonment.  The court sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts.  After the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive, USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduction under 18 U. S.C. 3582(c)(2).  That provision authorizes a
district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commissions policy statements.  The relevant policy statement, USSG 1B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range except in limited circumstances.  In addition to the two-level reduction authorized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, authorized the exercise of such discretion.  The District Court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to grant a further reduction.  Finding Booker inapplicable to 3582(c)(2) proceedings, the court concluded that the Commissions directives in 1B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended Guidelines range.  The Third Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Bookers holdings do not apply to 3582(c)(2) proceedings and therefore do not require treating 1B1.10(b) as advisory.  Pp.614.
(a)The statutes text and narrow scope belie Dillons characterization of proceedings under 3582(c)(2) as resentencing proceedings governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings.  Instead, 3582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence.  This conclusion is further supported by the substantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence-modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28 U. S.C. 994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under 3582(c)(2) only if [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.  Section 3582(c)(2) establishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the reduction, if any, authorized by 1B1.10, and then (2) consider whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the applicable 3553(a) factors.  At step one, the court must follow the Commissions instructions in 1B1.10 to impose a term of imprisonment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence.  1B1.10(b)(2).  Because reference to 3553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that provision does not transform 3582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary resentencing proceedings.  Pp.610.


(b)Given 3582(c)(2)s limited scope and purpose, proceedings under that section do not implicate Booker.  The section represents a congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.  Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge at a 3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judges exercise of discretion within that range.  That exercise does not contravene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found facts.  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481.  Thus, Dillons Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Courts adherence to 1B1.10s instruction to consider a reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.  Dillons argument that Bookers remedial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings under 3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing proceedings.  Pp.1013.


(c)Also rejected is Dillons argument that the District Court should have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing courts treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation of his criminal-history category.  Because those aspects of Dillons sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amendment, they are outside the scope of the 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and the District Court properly declined to address them.  Pp.1314.

08-538|"SCHWAB v. REILLY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 08538.Argued November 3, 2009Decided June 17, 2010
Respondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering business failed.  She supported her petition with, inter alia, Schedule B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt.  Her Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718.  On Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this business equipment: a tool[s] of the trade exemption for the statutory-maximum $1,850 in value, 11 U. S.C. 522(d)(6); and $8,868 under the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or wildcard, exemptions up to $10,225 in value.  The claimed exemptions total value ($10,718) equaled Reillys estimate of the equipments market value.  Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy estate [u]nless a party in interest objects, 522(l), within a certain 30-day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).  Absent an objection, the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemptions value exceeds what the Code permits.  See, e.g., 522(l); Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642643.


Although an appraisal revealed that the equipments total market value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bankruptcy estates trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions because the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of 522(d)(5) and (6).  Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718 she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining value to her creditors.  Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with the equipments estimated market value, she had put Schwab and her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipments full value, even if it turned out to be more than the amounts she declared and that the Code allowed.  She asserted that the estate had forfeited its claim to any portion of that value because Schwab had not objected within the Rule 4003(b) period, and that she would dismiss her petition rather than sell her equipment.


The Bankruptcy Court denied Schwabs motion and Reillys conditional motion to dismiss.  The District Court denied Schwab relief, rejecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the debtor declares as the exemptions value is within the limits the Code prescribes.  Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reillys Schedule C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipments full value.  Relying on Taylor, it held that Schwabs failure to object entitled Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code permitted.  
Held:Because Reilly gave the value of [her] claimed exemption[s] on Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what it defines as the property claimed as exempt, Schwab was not required to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estates right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the exempt interest.  Pp.623.
(a)Reillys complicated view of the trustees statutory obligation, and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code.  Pp.615.


(1)The parties agree that this case is governed by 522(l), which states that a Chapter 7 debtor must file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section, and that [u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.  Reilly asserts that the property claimed as exempt refers to all of the information on Schedule C, including the estimated market value of each asset.  Schwab and amicus United States counter that because the Code defines such property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular asset, not as the asset itself, the value of the property claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor assigns the interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.  Pp.69.


(2)Schwab and the United States are correct.  The portion of 522(l) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the property claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt unless an interested party objects.  Rather, it is the portion that defines the objections target, namely, the list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).  Section 522(b) does not define the property claimed as exempt by reference to the estimated market value.  It refers only to property defined in 522(d), which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as exempt.  Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here define property as the debtors interestup to a specified dollar amountin the assets described in the category, not as the assets themselves.  Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly claimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the Code allows.  Reillys contrary view does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the target of a trustees objection based on Schedule Cs language and dictionary definitions of property at odds with the Codes definition.  The Third Circuit failed to account for the Codes definition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or in full regardless of value.  See, e.g., 522(d)(9).  Schwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions propriety based on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled value of claimed exemption.  This conclusion does not render Reillys market value estimate superfluous.  It simply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may have value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose full value may not be available for exemption.  This interpretation is consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.  Pp.915.


(b)Taylor does not dictate a contrary conclusion.  While both Taylor and this case concern the consequences of a trustees failure to object to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003s time period, Taylor establishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount the debtor lists as the value claimed exempt is not within statutory limits.  In Taylor, the value listed in Schedule C ($ unknown) was not plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and $1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag present in Taylor.  Departing from Taylor would not only ignore the presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law; it would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of property claimed as exempt and the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating an exemptions validity.  Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.  Basing the definition of property claimed exempt, and thus an interested partys obligation to object under 522(l), on inferences that party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor assigns the property claimed as exempt as defined by the Code, would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to provide.  Pp.1618.


(c)Reillys argument threatens to convert the Codes goal of giving debtors a fresh start into a free pass.  By permitting a debtor to withdraw from the estate certain interests in property,  up to certain values, Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325, Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors.  This Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an exemptions validity under the Code.  In rejecting Reillys approach, the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on their rights.  The decision reached here encourages a debtor wishing to exempt an assets full market value or the asset itself to declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its scope clear.  Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond relevant statutory limits.  If the trustee fails to object, or his objection is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the assets full value.  If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allowance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to permit the exemption.  See Rule 1009(a).  Either result will facilitate the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reillys finality and clouded-title concerns.  Pp.1922.

The District Court denied Schwab relief, rejecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the debtor declares as the exemptions value is within the limits the Code prescribes.  Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reillys Schedule C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipments full value.  Relying on Taylor, it held that Schwabs failure to object entitled Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code permitted.  
Held:Because Reilly gave the value of [her] claimed exemption[s] on Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what it defines as the property claimed as exempt, Schwab was not required to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estates right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the exempt interest.  Pp.623.
(a)Reillys complicated view of the trustees statutory obligation, and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code.  Pp.615.


(1)The parties agree that this case is governed by 522(l), which states that a Chapter 7 debtor must file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section, and that [u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.  Reilly asserts that the property claimed as exempt refers to all of the information on Schedule C, including the estimated market value of each asset.  Schwab and amicus United States counter that because the Code defines such property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular asset, not as the asset itself, the value of the property claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor assigns the interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.  Pp.69.


(2)Schwab and the United States are correct.  The portion of 522(l) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the property claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt unless an interested party objects.  Rather, it is the portion that defines the objections target, namely, the list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).  Section 522(b) does not define the property claimed as exempt by reference to the estimated market value.  It refers only to property defined in 522(d), which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as exempt.  Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here define property as the debtors interestup to a specified dollar amountin the assets described in the category, not as the assets themselves.  Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly claimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the Code allows.  Reillys contrary view does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the target of a trustees objection based on Schedule Cs language and dictionary definitions of property at odds with the Codes definition.  The Third Circuit failed to account for the Codes definition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or in full regardless of value.  See, e.g., 522(d)(9).  Schwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions propriety based on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled value of claimed exemption.  This conclusion does not render Reillys market value estimate superfluous.  It simply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may have value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose full value may not be available for exemption.  This interpretation is consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.  Pp.915.


(b)Taylor does not dictate a contrary conclusion.  While both Taylor and this case concern the consequences of a trustees failure to object to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003s time period, Taylor establishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount the debtor lists as the value claimed exempt is not within statutory limits.  In Taylor, the value listed in Schedule C ($ unknown) was not plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and $1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag present in Taylor.  Departing from Taylor would not only ignore the presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law; it would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of property claimed as exempt and the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating an exemptions validity.  Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.  Basing the definition of property claimed exempt, and thus an interested partys obligation to object under 522(l), on inferences that party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor assigns the property claimed as exempt as defined by the Code, would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to provide.  Pp.1618.


(c)Reillys argument threatens to convert the Codes goal of giving debtors a fresh start into a free pass.  By permitting a debtor to withdraw from the estate certain interests in property,  up to certain values, Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325, Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors.  This Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an exemptions validity under the Code.  In rejecting Reillys approach, the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on their rights.  The decision reached here encourages a debtor wishing to exempt an assets full market value or the asset itself to declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its scope clear.  Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond relevant statutory limits.  If the trustee fails to object, or his objection is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the assets full value.  If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allowance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to permit the exemption.  See Rule 1009(a).  Either result will facilitate the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reillys finality and clouded-title concerns.

09-367|"DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 09367.Argued April 20, 2010Decided June 14, 2010
Petitioner Dolan pleaded guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily injury and entered into a plea agreement, which stated that the District Court could order restitution for his victim.  Dolans presentence report also noted that restitution was required, but did not recommend an amount because of a lack of information on hospital costs and lost wages.  The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act provides that if the victims losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victims losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.  18 U. S.C. 3664(d)(5).  On July 30, the District Court held a sentencing hearing and imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release.  On August 8, the court entered a judgment, stating that restitution was applicable but leaving open the amount of restitution given that no information had yet been received regarding possible restitution payments.  On October 5, 67 days later, an addendum documenting the restitution amount was added to the presentence report.  The court did not set a hearing until February 4, about three months after the 90-day deadline had expired.  At the hearing, Dolan argued that because that deadline had passed, the law no longer authorized restitution.  Disagreeing, the court ordered restitution, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Held: A sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power to order restitutionat least where, as here, that court made clear prior to the deadlines expiration that it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.  Pp.315.
(a)To determine the consequences of a missed deadline where, as here, the statute does not specify them, this Court looks to the statutory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about the deadlines purposes.  A jurisdictional deadlines expiration prevents a court from permitting or taking the action to which the statute attached the deadline.  The prohibition is absolute.  It cannot be waived or extended for equitable reasons.  See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133134.  Other deadlines are claims-processing rules, which do not limit a courts jurisdiction, but regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court.  Unless a party points out that another litigant has missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the deadlines protection.  See, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454456.  In other instances, a deadline seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally enforceable but does not deprive the judge or other public official of the power to take the action even if the deadline is missed.  See, e.g., United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722.  In light of its language, context, and purposes, the statute at issue sets forth this third kind of limitation.  The fact that a sentencing court misses the 90-day deadline, even through its own or the Governments fault, does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution.  Pp.35.


(b)Several considerations lead to this conclusion.  First, where, as here, a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with its timing provisions, federal courts will not ordinarily impose their own coercive sanction.  United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63.  A statutes use of shall alone, see 3664(d)(5), does not necessarily bar judges from taking the action to which the missed deadline refers.  Second, the statute places primary weight on, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes.  See 3663A.  Third, the statutes procedural provisions reinforce this substantive purpose.  They reveal that the statute seeks speed primarily to help crime victims secure prompt restitution, not to provide defendants with certainty as to the amount of their liability.  Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order restitution would harm the victims, who likely bear no responsibility for the deadlines being missed and whom the statute seeks to benefit.  That kind of harm to third parties provides a strong indication that Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture.  See Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 262.  Fifth, the Court has interpreted similar statutes, such as the Bail Reform Act of 1984, similarly.  See Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 721.  Sixth, the defendant normally can mitigate potential harm  by telling the court that he fears the deadline will be, or just has been, missed, and the court will likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.  Pp.510. 


(c)This Court has not understated the potential harm to a defendant of a missed deadline.  Petitioner claims that because the sentence will not be a final judgment for appeal purposes without a definitive determination of the restitution amount, to delay that determination beyond the deadline is to delay his ability to appeal.  But a defendant who knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware of the amount can usually avoid additional delay by asking for a timely hearing; if the court refuses, he could seek mandamus.  And in the unlikely instance that delay causes the defendant prejudice, he remains free to ask the appellate court to take that fact and any other equitable considerations into account on review.  This does not mean that the Court accepts petitioners premise that a sentencing judgment is not final until the restitution amount is determined.  Although that question need not be decided here, strong arguments favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determining the restitution amount.  A judgment imposing discipline may still be freighted with sufficiently substantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.  Corey v. United States, 375 U. S. 169, 174.  And several statutes say that a judgment of conviction that includes imprisonment is a final judgment.  E.g., 18 U. S.C. 3582(b).  Moreover, 3664(o) provides that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution, such as the later restitution order here, is a final judgment.  Even assuming that the rule of lenity could be applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context, here there is no statutory ambiguity sufficiently grievous to warrant its application in this case.  Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139.  Pp.1015.
571 F.3d 1022, affirmed.

09-5327|"HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 095327.Argued March 1, 2010Decided June 14, 2010
Petitioner Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida state court.  After the State Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal and denied collateral relief, Holland filed a pro se federal habeas corpus petition, which was approximately five weeks late under the 1-year statute of limitations set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.C. 2244(d).  The record facts reveal, inter alia, that Hollands court-appointed attorney, Bradley Collins, had failed to file a timely federal petition, despite Hollands many letters emphasizing the importance of doing so; that Collins apparently did not do the research necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite the fact that Holland had identified the applicable legal rules for him; that Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely manner that the State Supreme Court had decided his case, despite Hollands many pleas for that information; and that Collins failed to communicate with Holland over a period of years, despite Hollands pleas for responses to his letters.  Meanwhile, Holland repeatedly requested that the state courts and the Florida bar remove Collins from his case.  Based on these and other record facts, Holland asked the Federal District Court to toll the AEDPA limitations period for equitable reasons.  It refused, holding that he had not demonstrated the due diligence necessary to invoke equitable tolling.  Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, regardless of diligence, Hollands case did not constitute extraordinary circumstances.  Specifically, it held that when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing based on his attorneys unprofessional conduct, that conduct, even if grossly negligent, cannot  justify equitable tolling absent proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment, or the like.  
Held: 
1.Section 2244(d), the AEDPA statute of limitations, is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.  Pp.1221.


(a)Several considerations support the Courts holding.  First, because AEDPAs statute of limitations defense  is not jurisdictional, Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205, 213, it is subject to a rebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 9596.  That presumptions strength is reinforced here by the fact that equitable principles have traditionally governed substantive habeas law.  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. 674, ___, and the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA after Irwin and therefore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting AEDPAs timing provisions, would apply the presumption, see, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Second, 2244(d) differs significantly from the statutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350352, and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38, 49, in which the Court held that Irwins presumption had been overcome.  For example, unlike the subject matters at issue in those casestax collection and land claimsAEDPAs subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity finds a comfortable home.  See Munaf, supra, at ___.  Brockamp, supra, at 352, distinguished.  Moreover, AEDPAs limitations period is neither unusually generous nor unusually complex.  Finally, the Court disagrees with respondents argument that equitable tolling undermines AEDPAs basic purpose of eliminating delays in the federal habeas review process, see, e.g., Day, supra, at 205206.  AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas corpus principles and by harmonizing the statute with prior law, under which a petitions timeliness was always determined under equitable principles.  See, e.g., Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483.  Such harmonization, along with the Great Writs importance as the only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPAs silence on equitable tolling as congressional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would keep open.  Pp.1216. 


(b)The Eleventh Circuits per se standard is too rigid.  A petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.  Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418.  Such extraordinary circumstances are not limited to those that satisfy the Eleventh Circuits test.  Courts must often exercise [their] equity powers  on a case-by-case basis, Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 375, demonstrating flexibility and avoiding mechanical rules, Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396, in order to relieve hardships  aris[ing] from a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules, Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248.  The Courts cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753, distinguished.  No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Eleventh Circuits rule.  That rule is difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least sometimes, an attorneys unprofessional conduct can be so egregious as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, as several other federal courts have specifically held.  Although equitable tolling is not warranted for a garden variety claim of excusable neglect, Irwin, supra, at 96, this case presents far more serious instances of attorney misconduct than that.  Pp.1619. 


2.While the record facts suggest that this case may well present extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary.  The District Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circumstances, but on a lack of diligence.  Here, Holland diligently pursued his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins be removed from his case, and by filing his own pro se habeas petition on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired.  Because the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not diligent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.  The Eleventh Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropriate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might indicate that the State should prevail.  Pp.1921.  
539 F.3d 1334, reversed and remanded.

Courts must often exercise [their] equity powers  on a case-by-case basis, Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 375, demonstrating flexibility and avoiding mechanical rules, Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396, in order to relieve hardships  aris[ing] from a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules, Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248.  The Courts cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753, distinguished.  No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Eleventh Circuits rule.  That rule is difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least sometimes, an attorneys unprofessional conduct can be so egregious as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, as several other federal courts have specifically held.  Although equitable tolling is not warranted for a garden variety claim of excusable neglect, Irwin, supra, at 96, this case presents far more serious instances of attorney misconduct than that.  Pp.1619. 


2.While the record facts suggest that this case may well present extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary.  The District Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circumstances, but on a lack of diligence.  Here, Holland diligently pursued his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins be removed from his case, and by filing his own pro se habeas petition on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired.  Because the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not diligent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.  The Eleventh Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropriate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might indicate that the State should prevail.  Pp.1921.

09-60|"CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 0960.Argued March 31, 2010Decided June 14, 2010
Petitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, faced deportation after committing two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas.  For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.  For the second, possession without a prescription of one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days.  Texas law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but Texas did not seek such an enhancement here.  After the second conviction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings.  Petitioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eligible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any aggravated felony, 8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3).  Section 1101(a)(43)(B) defines that term to include, inter alia, illicit trafficking in a controlled substance  including a drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U. S.C. 924(c), which, in turn, defines a drug trafficking crime as a felony punishable under, inter alia, the Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S.C. 801 et seq.).  A felony is a crime for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year.  3559(a).  Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misdemeanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction after a prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State  has become finala recidivist simple possession offenseis punishable as a felony under 924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sentence.  Only this recidivist simple possession category might be an aggravated felony under 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43).  A prosecutor must charge the existence of the prior conviction.  See 21 U. S.C. 851(a)(1).  Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity, 851(b)(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites to authorize a felony punishment, 18 U. S.C. 3559(a), for the simple possession offense at issue.


Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioners second simple possession conviction was an aggravated felony that made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.  The Board of Immigration Appeals and Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on the holding in Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 56that to be an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable as a felony under federal lawthe court used a hypothetical approach, concluding that because petitioners conduct could have been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.
Held:Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under 1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.  Pp.919.
(a)Considering the disputed provisions terms and their commonsense conception, Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53, it would be counterintuitive and unorthodox to apply an aggravated felony or illicit trafficking label to petitioners recidivist possession, see id., at 54.  The same is true for his penalty.  One does not usually think of a 10-day sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an aggravated felony.  This Court must be very wary in this case because the Government seeks a result that the English language tells [the Court] not to expect.  Ibid.  Pp.911.


(b)The Governments positionthat conduct punishable as a felony should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal lawis unpersuasive.  First, it ignores the INAs text, which limits the Attorney Generals cancellation power only when, inter alia, a noncitizen has  been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.  8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3).  Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not what might have or could have been charged.  Under the Controlled Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sentence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend against that charge.  Here, petitioners record of conviction contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.  An immigration court cannot, expost, enhance the state offense of record just because facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty.  The Government contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court under identical circumstances, he would have committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes.  But his circumstances were not identical to the Governments hypothesis.  And the Governments approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3), which requires an aggravated felony convictionnot that the noncitizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.  Second, the Governments position fails to effectuate 21 U. S.C. 851s mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are integral to the structure and design of federal drug laws.  They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.  So do many state criminal codes, including Texas.  Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecutors independent judgment to execute such laws.  Third, the Fifth Circuit misread Lopez.  This Court never used a hypothetical approach in its analysis.  By focusing on facts known to the immigration court that could have but did not serve as the basis for the state conviction and punishment, the Circuits approach introduces a level of conjecture that has no basis in Lopez.  Fourth, the Governments argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts, for it is quite unlikely that petitioners conduct would have been punished as a felony in federal court.  Finally, as the Court noted in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n.8, ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the noncitizens favor.  Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has committed an aggravated felony is relevant to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact removable.  Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney Generals discretion.  Pp.1118.

08-1322|"ASTRUE, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY v. RATLIFF
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 081322.Argued February 22, 2010Decided June 14, 2010
Respondent Ratliff was Ruby Kills Rees attorney in Rees successful suit against the United States Social Security Administration for Social Security benefits.  The District Court granted Rees unopposed motion for attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which provides, inter alia, that a court shall award to a prevailing party  fees and other expenses  in any civil action  brought by or against the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2412(d)(1)(A).  Before paying the fees award, the Government discovered that Ree owed the United States a debt that predated the award.  Accordingly, it sought an administrative offset against the award under 31 U. S.C. 3716, which subjects to offset all funds payable by the United States, 3701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts, see 3701(b), unless, e.g., payment is exempted by statute or regulation.  See, e.g., 3716(e)(2).  The parties to this case have not established that any such exemption applies to 2412(d) fees awards, which, as of 2005, are covered by the Treasury Departments Offset Program (TOP).  After the Government notified Ree that it would apply TOP to offset her fees award against a portion of her debt, Ratliff intervened, challenging the offset on the grounds that 2412(d) fees belong to a litigants attorney and thus may not be used to satisfy the litigants federal debts.  The District Court held that because 2412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the prevailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to challenge the offset.  The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under its precedent, EAJA attorneys fees are awarded to prevailing parties attorneys.  
Held:A 2412(d)(1)(A) attorneys fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigants pre-existing debt to the Government.  Pp. 311.
(a)Nothing in EAJA contradicts this Courts longstanding view that the term prevailing party in attorneys fees statutes is a term of art that refers to the prevailing litigant.  See, e.g., Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603.  That the term has its usual meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is underscored by the fact that subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.  The Court disagrees with Ratliffs assertion that subsection (d)(1)(A)s use of the verb award nonetheless renders 2412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing partys attorney.  The dictionaries show that, in the litigation context, the transitive verb award has the settled meaning of giving or assigning by judicial decree.  Its plain meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is thus that the court shall give or assign by  judicial determination to the prevailing party (here, Ree) attorneys fees in the amount sought and substantiated under, inter alia, subsection (d)(1)(B).  That the prevailing partys attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclusion.  Pp. 36.


(b)The Court rejects Ratliffs argument that other EAJA provisions, combined with the Social Security Act (SSA) and the Governments practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases, render 2412(d) at least ambiguous on the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor.  Even accepting that 2412(d) is ambiguous the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter the Courts conclusion.  Subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards.  Nor is the necessity of such payments established by the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies.  That SSA fees awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimants attorney, see 42 U. S.C. 406(b)(1)(A), undermines Ratliffs case by showing that Congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it desires to do so.  Given the stark contrast between the language of the SSA and EAJA provisions, the Court is reluctant to interpret subsection (d)(1)(A) to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence that such a requirement applies.  Such evidence is not supplied by a 1985 EAJA amendment requiring that, where the claimants attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S.C. 406(b) and 28 U. S.C. 2412(d)], the  attorney [must] refun[d] to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.  See note following 2412.  Ratliffs argument that this recognition that an attorney will sometimes receiv[e] 2412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A) should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to recei[pt] than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attorneys obligation to refund the smaller fee to the claimant demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place.  Moreover, Ratliffs reading is irreconcilable with the textual differences between the two Acts.  The fact that the Government, until 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney her rights in the award does not alter the Courts interpretation of the Acts fees provision.  That some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets against attorneys fees awards.  And as Ratliff admits, the Government has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has assigned her right to fees to the attorney.  Finally, the Courts conclusion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S.C. 1988, which contains language virtually identical to 2412(d)(1)(A)s.  See, e.g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 730732, and n.19.  Pp. 611. 
540 F.3d 800, reversed and remanded.

08-998|"HAMILTON, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE v. LANNING
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 08998.Argued March 22, 2010Decided June 7, 2010
Debtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.  If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or provides that all of the debtors projected disposable income to be received over the plans duration will be applied to make payments in accordance with plan terms.  11 U. S.C. 1325(b)(1).  Before enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined disposable income.  Though it did not define projected disposable income, most bankruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determining the disposable portion of the result.  In exceptional cases, those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtors income or expenses.  BAPCPA defines disposable income as current monthly income received by the debtor less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for, e.g., the debtors maintenance and support.  1325(b)(2)(A)(i).  Current monthly income, in turn, is calculated by averaging the debtors monthly income during a 6-month look-back period preceding the petitions filing.  See 101(10A)(A)(i).  If a debtors income is below the median for his or her State, amounts reasonably necessary include the full amount needed for maintenance or support, see 1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtors income exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included, see 707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).


A one-time buyout from respondents former employer caused her current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13 petition to exceed her States median income.  However, based on the income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03.  She thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months.  Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because she had not committed all of her projected disposable income to repaying creditors.  Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60 months.  Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.


The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month period, concluding that projected requires courts to consider the debtors actual income.  The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court calculating projected disposable income should begin with the presumption that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtors circumstances.
Held:When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtors projected disposable income, the court may account for changes in the debtors income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.  Pp.618.
(a)Respondent has the better interpretation of projected disposable income.  First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by the ordinary meaning of projected.  See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187.  In ordinary usage future occurrences are not projected based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself.  While a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the outcome.  Second, projected appears in many federal statutes, yet Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication.  See, e.g., 7 U. S.C. 1301(b)(8)(B).  By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows, Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambiguouscommonly using the term multiplied.  See, e.g., 11 U. S.C. 1325(b)(3).  Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtors current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income, but would also have discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtors income.  This is significant, since the Court will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure, Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 454, and Congress did not amend the term projected disposable income in 2005.  Pp.610.


(b)The mechanical approach also clashes with 1325s terms.  First, 1325(b)(1)(B)s reference to projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period strongly favors the forward-looking approach.  Because respondent would have far less than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, petitioners projection does not accurately reflect disposable income to be received.  In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effectively reads that phrase out of the statute.  Second, 1325(b)(1)s direction to courts to determine projected disposable income as of the effective date of the plan, i.e., the confirmation dateis more consistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information about a debtors financial situation.  Had Congress intended for projected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable income, it could have specified the plans filing date as the effective date.  Third, 1325(b)(1)(B)s requirement that projected disposable income will be applied to make payments is rendered a hollow command if, as of the plans effective date, the debtor lacks the means to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts.  Pp.1112. 


(c)The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unpersuasive.  The claim that the Codes detailed and precise disposable income definition would have no purpose without the mechanical approach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula plays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a disposable income calculation.  The Tenth Circuits rebuttable presumption analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of projected.  This Court rejects petitioners argument that only the mechanical approach is consistent with 1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)).  And the Court declines to infer from the fact that 1325(b)(3) incorporates 707which allows courts to consider special circumstances, but only with respect to calculating expensesthat Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain changes.  Pp.1214.


(d)Petitioners proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtorsa debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually high income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a 6-month period more representative of the debtors future disposable income; a debtor could dismiss the petition and refile at a later, more favorable date; and respondent might have been able to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or converting her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7are all flawed.  Pp.1418.

			"|"HAMILTON, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE v. LANNING
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 08998.Argued March 22, 2010Decided June 7, 2010
Debtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.  If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or provides that all of the debtors projected disposable income to be received over the plans duration will be applied to make payments in accordance with plan terms.  11 U. S.C. 1325(b)(1).  Before enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined disposable income.  Though it did not define projected disposable income, most bankruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determining the disposable portion of the result.  In exceptional cases, those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtors income or expenses.  BAPCPA defines disposable income as current monthly income received by the debtor less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for, e.g., the debtors maintenance and support.  1325(b)(2)(A)(i).  Current monthly income, in turn, is calculated by averaging the debtors monthly income during a 6-month look-back period preceding the petitions filing.  See 101(10A)(A)(i).  If a debtors income is below the median for his or her State, amounts reasonably necessary include the full amount needed for maintenance or support, see 1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtors income exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included, see 707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).


A one-time buyout from respondents former employer caused her current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13 petition to exceed her States median income.  However, based on the income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03.  She thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months.  Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because she had not committed all of her projected disposable income to repaying creditors.

09-5201|"BARBER etal. v. THOMAS, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 095201.Argued March 30, 2010Decided June 7, 2010
The federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a prisoner  serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year  may receive credit toward the service of [that] sentence  of up to 54 days at the end of each year subject to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) determination  that, during that year, the prisoner has behaved in an exemplary fashion.  18 U. S.C. 3624(b)(1).  Credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated .  Ibid.  The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54 days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets those days to the side.  When the difference between the time remaining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that final year proportional to the awards in other years.


Petitioners claim that the BOPs calculation method is unlawful because 3624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the length of time that the prisoner actually serves.  The District Court rejected this challenge in each of petitioners cases, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Because the BOPs method for calculating good time credit reflects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful.  Pp.517.
(a)The statutes language and purpose, taken together, support the BOPs method.  That method tracks 3624(b)s language by providing a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of imprisonment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any additional time served that is less than a full year.  As 3624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the end of each year of imprisonment.  Petitioners approach cannot be reconciled with the statute.  Because it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that he does not spend in prison.  Moreover the calculation of credit for such a year would not be made at the end of that year.  Nor could the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior during that year.  This language did not find its way into the statute by accident.  The differences between the prior provision (repealed in 1984)which granted the prisoner a deduction at the outset of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rulesand the present statuteunder which credit is earned at the end of the year based on an evaluation of behavior during that yearshow an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospective award.  The BOPs method also furthers the basic purpose of the statute.  Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater honesty by mak[ing] all sentences basically determinate.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367.  Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.  Ibid.  Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide an incentive for prisoners to compl[y] with institutional disciplinary regulations.  The exception is limited and tailored to its purposecredit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good behavior.  The BOPs approach furthers 3624s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior during the preceding year.  In contrast, petitioners approach would allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would loosen the statutes connection between good behavior and the good time award.  Pp.58.


(b)Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  Context indicates that the phrase term of imprisonment as used in the portion of 3624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as petitioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge.  Petitioners reliance on legislative history is misplaced.  A U. S. Sentencing Commission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular question whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence imposed.  Nor, in light of the statutes text, structure, history, and purpose, is this a case in which there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute, Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139, permitting application of the rule of lenity.  Because the BOPs calculation system applies the statute as its language is most naturally read, and in accordance with the statutes basic purpose, this Court need not determine the extent to which Congress has granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute more broadly, or differently than it has done here.  Cf. Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844845.  And because the BOPs approach reflects the statutes most natural reading and is the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dissents alternative interpretation.  Pp.817.
Affirmed.

09-940|"UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09940Decided June 7, 2010
Per Curiam.

In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Montana with juvenile delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U. S.C. 5031 et seq.  Respondent eventually pleaded true to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under 12 years of age, which would have been a crime under 2241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an adult.  In June 2005, the District Court accepted respondents plea and adjudged him delinquent.  The court sentenced respondent to two years official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday.  The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center and to abide by the centers conditions of residency.


In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S.C. 16901 et seq.  With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school.  16911(8); 16913.  In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNAs requirements apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].  72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR 72.3 (2009)).


In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondents juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program.  The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday.  The Government, invoking SORNAs juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervision.  As special conditions of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.


The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Courts order.  590 F.3d 924 (2010).  The Court of Appeals determined that retroactive application of SORNAs provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNAs passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.  Id., at 927.  The court thus held that SORNAs juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].  Id., at 928.


The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuits determination that SORNA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNAs enactment.  Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness.  Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender.  But on May 2, 2008, respondents term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions.  As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress collateral consequences adequate to meet Article IIIs injury-in-fact requirement.  Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998).


Perhaps the most likely potential collateral consequenc[e] that might be remedied by a judgment in respondents favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.  (By the time of the court of appeals decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.  Pet. for Cert. 29.)  We thus must know whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent could remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.  Ibid.  Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 15 (2009):
Is respondents duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. 4623502(6)(b), 4151513(1)(c) (2005); State v. Villanueva, 328 Mont. 135, 138140, 118 P.3d 179, 181182 (2005); see also 4623502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see 4623502(10) (2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, 31, p. 2185?

We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme Court accept our certified question.  The courts answer to this question will help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on point.  Mont. Rule App. Proc. 15(3).  We understand that the Montana Supreme Court may wish to reformulate the certified question.  Rule 15(6)(a)(iii).  


The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of Montana a copy of this opinion, the briefs filed in this Court in this case, and a list of the counsel appearing in this matter along with their names and addresses.  See Rules 15(5) and (6)(a)(iv).  Further proceedings in this case are reserved pending our receipt of a response from the Supreme Court of Montana.
It is so ordered.

			In 2005, respondent was charged with delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. 5031 et seq., for sexually abusing a boy for approximately two years until respondent was 15 years old and his victim was 12 years old. Respondent was sentenced to two years of juvenile detention followed by juvenile supervision until his 21st birthday. In 2006, while respondent remained in juvenile detention, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. 16902 et seq. In July 2007, the District Court determined that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of his prerelease program. On appeal, respondent challenged his ""special conditio[n]"" of supervision and requested that the Court of Appeals ""reverse th[e] portion of his sentence requiring Sex Offender Registration and remand with instructions that the district court ... strik[e] Sex Offender Registration as a condition of juvenile supervision."" Over a year after respondent's 21st birthday, the Court of Appeals handed down its decision and held that the SORNA requirements violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, section 9, cl. 3, when applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before SORNA's enactment. The Court held that the Court of Appeals had no authority to enter that judgment because it had no live controversy before it where respondent had turned 21 and where the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness did not apply in this case. Accordingly, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit was vacated and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09940Decided June 7, 2010
Per Curiam.

In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Montana with juvenile delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U. S.C. 5031 et seq.  Respondent eventually pleaded true to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under 12 years of age, which would have been a crime under 2241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an adult.  In June 2005, the District Court accepted respondents plea and adjudged him delinquent.  The court sentenced respondent to two years official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday.  The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center and to abide by the centers conditions of residency.


In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S.C. 16901 et seq.  With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school.  16911(8); 16913.  In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNAs requirements apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].  72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR 72.3 (2009)).


In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondents juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program.  The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday.  The Government, invoking SORNAs juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervision.  As special conditions of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.


The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Courts order.  590 F.3d 924 (2010).  The Court of Appeals determined that retroactive application of SORNAs provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNAs passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.  Id., at 927.  The court thus held that SORNAs juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].  Id., at 928.


The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuits determination that SORNA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNAs enactment.  Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness.  Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender.  But on May 2, 2008, respondents term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions.  As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress collateral consequences adequate to meet Article IIIs injury-in-fact requirement.  Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998).


Perhaps the most likely potential collateral consequenc[e] that might be remedied by a judgment in respondents favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.  (By the time of the court of appeals decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.  Pet. for Cert. 29.)  We thus must know whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent could remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.  Ibid.  Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 15 (2009):
Is respondents duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. 4623502(6)(b), 4151513(1)(c) (2005); State v. Villanueva, 328 Mont. 135, 138140, 118 P.3d 179, 181182 (2005); see also 4623502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see 4623502(10) (2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, 31, p. 2185?

We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme Court accept our certified question.  The courts answer to this question will help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on point.  Mont. Rule App. Proc. 15(3).  We understand that the Montana Supreme Court may wish to reformulate the certified question.  Rule 15(6)(a)(iii).  


The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of Montana a copy of this opinion, the briefs filed in this Court in this case, and a list of the counsel appearing in this matter along with their names and addresses.  See Rules 15(5) and (6)(a)(iv).  Further proceedings in this case are reserved pending our receipt of a response from the Supreme Court of Montana.
It is so ordered.

10-290|"MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LIMITED PARTNERSHIP etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 10290.Argued April 18, 2011Decided June 9, 2011
In asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an alleged infringer must contend with 282 of the Patent Act of 1952 (Act), under which [a] patent shall be presumed valid and [t]he burden of establishing invalidity  shall rest on the party asserting it.  Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read 282 to require a defendant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.


Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which claims an improved method for editing computer documents.  After i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the patent was invalid under 102(b)s on-sale bar, which precludes patent protection for any invention that was on sale in this country more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.  The parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent application, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the invention claimed in i4is patent.  Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Microsoft objected to i4is proposed jury instruction that the invalidity defense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  The District Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsofts alternative instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence standard.  The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent and had failed to prove the patents invalidity.  The Federal Circuit affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of 282.
Held:Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp. 520.
(a)The Court rejects Microsofts contention that a defendant need only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof, its choice generally controls.  Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 95.  Congress has made such a choice here.  While 282 includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Congress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the term  comes with a common law meaning.  Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58.  Here, by stating that a patent is presumed valid, 282, Congress used a term with a settled common-law meaning.  Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative.  There, tracing nearly a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that there is a presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence, id., at 2. Microsofts contention that the Courts pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing standard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the absence of those qualifications from the Courts cases.  Also unpersuasive is Microsofts argument that the Federal Circuits interpretation must fail because it renders superfluous 282s additional statement that [t]he burden of establishing invalidity  shall rest on the party asserting it.  The canon against superfluity assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.  Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174.  Here, no interpretation of 282 avoids excess language because, under either of Microsofts alternative theoriesthat the presumption only allocates the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of production and persuasionthe presumption itself would be unnecessary in light of 282s additional statement as to the challengers burden.  Pp. 513.


(b)Also rejected is Microsofts argument that a preponderance standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder was not before the PTO during the examination process.  It is true enough that, in these circumstances, the rationale underlying the presumptionthat the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the claimseems much diminished, KSR Intl Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the presumption.  But the question remains whether Congress has specified the applicable standard of proof.  As established here today, Congress did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent validity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.  The Courts pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsofts fluctuating standard of proof.  And they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense.  In fact, the Court indicated to the contrary.  See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8.  Finally, the Court often applied the heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the relevant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.  See, e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U. S. 216, 227, 233.  Nothing in 282s text suggests that Congress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case.  Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it presumably would have said so expressly.  Those pre-Act cases where various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weakened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment may lose significant force.  Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427.  Consistent with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp. 1418.


(c)This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the parties policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.  Congress specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of patent validity.  During the nearly 30 years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted 282 as the Court does today, Congress has often amended 282 and other patent laws, but apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard of proof.  Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuits interpretation in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Government and without.  Accordingly, any recalibration of the standard of proof remains in Congress hands.  Pp. 1820.
598 F.3d 831, affirmed.
Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

08-1470|"BERGHUIS, WARDEN v. THOMPKINS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 081470.Argued March 1, 2010Decided June 1, 2010
After advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and another Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which one victim died.  At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he wanted an attorney.  He was largely silent during the 3-hour interrogation, but near the end, he answered yes when asked if he prayed to God to forgive him for the shooting.  He moved to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.  At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prosecution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder and assault.  Thompkins defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots.  During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoys jury had made the right decision.  Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoys trial only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins guilt.  The jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Purifoys trial.  On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both Thompkins Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims.  The Federal District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), for the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right to remain silent.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. 
Held:
1.The state courts decision rejecting Thompkins Miranda claim was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reasonable under AEDPAs more deferential standard of review.  Pp.717.


(a)Thompkins silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right to remain silent.  A suspects Miranda right to counsel must be invoked unambiguously.  Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459.  If the accused makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement or no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accuseds intent, id., at 461462.  There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis.  Both protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked.  The unambiguous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that avoid[s] difficulties of proof and  provide[s] guidance to officers on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.  Davis, supra, at 458459.  Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the questioning.  He did neither.  Pp.810.


(b)Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.  A waiver must be the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception and made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421.  Such a waiver may be implied through a defendants silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver.  North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373.  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accuseds uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver.  The record here shows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.  First, the lack of any contention that he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he gave up when he spoke.  See Burbine, supra, at 421.  Second, his answer to the question about God is a course of conduct indicating waiver of that right.  Butler, supra, at 373.  Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.  That he made a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver.  Third, there is no evidence that his statement was coerced.  See Burbine, supra, at 421.  He does not claim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.  The interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle of the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour interrogation is inherently coercive.  Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 163164, n.1.  The fact that the question referred to religious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary.  Id., at 170.  Pp.1015.


(c)Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver.  However, a rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with Butlers holding that courts can infer a waiver from the actions and words of the person interrogated.  441 U. S., at 373.  Any waiver, express or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time, terminating further interrogation.  When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation progresses.  After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights.  Thus, the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins Miranda rights before interrogating him.  Pp.1517.


2.Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record.  To establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must show both deficient performance and prejudice.  Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  To establish prejudice, a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury, id., at 695.  Here, the Sixth Circuit did not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.  The state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence of Purifoys earlier conviction.  Even if it used an incorrect legal standard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPAs deferential standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him.  De novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review.  See 2254(a).  Assuming that failure to request a limiting instruction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other evidence of guilt.  The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance camera photograph.  A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him, and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting.  The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoys credibility, as it was instructed to do.  Pp.1719.
547 F.3d 572, reversed and remanded.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

Thompkins defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots.  During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoys jury had made the right decision.  Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoys trial only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins guilt.  The jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Purifoys trial.  On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both Thompkins Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims.  The Federal District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), for the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right to remain silent.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. 
Held:
1.The state courts decision rejecting Thompkins Miranda claim was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reasonable under AEDPAs more deferential standard of review.  Pp.717.


(a)Thompkins silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right to remain silent.  A suspects Miranda right to counsel must be invoked unambiguously.  Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459.  If the accused makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement or no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accuseds intent, id., at 461462.  There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis.  Both protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked.  The unambiguous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that avoid[s] difficulties of proof and  provide[s] guidance to officers on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.  Davis, supra, at 458459.  Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the questioning.  He did neither.  Pp.810.


(b)Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.  A waiver must be the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception and made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421.  Such a waiver may be implied through a defendants silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver.  North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373.  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accuseds uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver.  The record here shows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.  First, the lack of any contention that he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he gave up when he spoke.  See Burbine, supra, at 421.  Second, his answer to the question about God is a course of conduct indicating waiver of that right.  Butler, supra, at 373.  Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.  That he made a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver.  Third, there is no evidence that his statement was coerced.  See Burbine, supra, at 421.  He does not claim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.  The interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle of the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour interrogation is inherently coercive.  Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 163164, n.1.  The fact that the question referred to religious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary.  Id., at 170.  Pp.1015.


(c)Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver.  However, a rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with Butlers holding that courts can infer a waiver from the actions and words of the person interrogated.  441 U. S., at 373.  Any waiver, express or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time, terminating further interrogation.  When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation progresses.  After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights.  Thus, the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins Miranda rights before interrogating him.  Pp.1517.


2.Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record.  To establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must show both deficient performance and prejudice.  Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  To establish prejudice, a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury, id., at 695.  Here, the Sixth Circuit did not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.  The state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence of Purifoys earlier conviction.  Even if it used an incorrect legal standard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPAs deferential standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him.  De novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review.  See 2254(a).  Assuming that failure to request a limiting instruction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other evidence of guilt.  The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance camera photograph.  A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him, and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting.  The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoys credibility, as it was instructed to do.  Pp.1719.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 081555.Argued March 3, 2010Decided June 1, 2010
Respondents, who were persecuted by the Somali government during the 1980s, filed a damages action alleging that petitioner, who then held high level government positions, exercised command and control over the military forces committing the abuses; that he knew or should have known of these acts; and that he aided and abetted in their commission.  The District Court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioners motion to dismiss the suit, resting its decision on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), which provides that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act, 28 U. S.C. 1604.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the FSIA does not apply to officials of a foreign state.  
Held:The FSIA does not govern petitioners claim of immunity.  Pp.420.
(a)Under the common-law doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity, see Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, if the State Department granted a sovereigns diplomatic request for a suggestion of immunity, the district court surrendered its jurisdiction, Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 573, 581, 587.  If the State Department refused, the court could decide the immunity issue itself.  Id., at 587.  In 1952, the State Department moved from a policy of requesting immunity in most actions against friendly sovereigns to a restrictive theory that confined immunity to suits involving the foreign sovereigns public acts.  Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 487.  Inconsistent application of sovereign immunity followed, leading to the FSIA, whose primary purposes are (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive theory, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for deciding claims of foreign states to immunity from the State Department to the courts.  1602.  This Act now governs the determination whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity.  Pp.47.


(b)Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that foreign state should be read to include an official acting on behalf of that state.  The Act specifies that a foreign state includes a political subdivision  or an agency or instrumentality of that state, 1603(a), and specifically delimits what counts as an agency or instrumentality, 1603(b).  Textual clues in the agency or instrumentality definitionany entity matching three specified characteristics, ibid.cut against reading it to include a foreign official.  Entity typically refers to an organization; and the required statutory characteristicse.g., separate legal person, 1603(b)(1)apply awkwardly, if at all, to individuals.  Section 1603(a)s foreign state definition is also inapplicable.  The list set out there, even if illustrative rather than exclusive, does not suggest that officials are included, since the listed defendants are all entities.  The Courts conclusion is also supported by the fact that Congress expressly mentioned officials elsewhere in the FSIA when it wished to count their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state.  Moreover, other FSIA provisionse.g., 1608(a)point away from reading foreign state to include foreign officials.  Pp.713.


(c)The FSIAs history and purposes also do not support petitioners argument that the Act governs his immunity claim.  There is little reason to presume that when Congress codified state immunity, it intended to codify, sub silentio, official immunity.  The canon of construction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the common law does not help decide the question whether, when a statutes coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended it to govern a particular field.  State and official immunities may not be coextensive, and historically, the Government has suggested common-law immunity for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qualify.  Though a foreign states immunity may, in some circumstances, extend to an individual for official acts, it does not follow that Congress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA.  Official immunity was simply not the problem that Congress was addressing when enacting that Act.  The Courts construction of the Act should not be affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt to select between application of the FSIA or the common law.  This case, where respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets, is governed by the common law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as defined by the FSIA.  Pp.1319.


(d)Whether petitioner may be entitled to common-law immunity and whether he may have other valid defenses are matters to be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.  P.20.

09-223|"LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 09223.Argued March 22, 2010Decided June 1, 2010
Historically, all Ohio natural gas consumers purchased gas from a local distribution company (LDC), the public utility serving their geographic area.  Today, however, consumers in Ohios major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with independent marketers (IMs) that compete with LDCs for retail sales of  natural gas.  Respondents, mainly IMs offering to sell natural gas to Ohio consumers, sued petitioner Ohio Tax Commissioner (Commissioner) in federal court, alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating three tax exemptions Ohio grants exclusively to LDCs.  The court initially held that respondents suit was not blocked by the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State, 28 U. S.C. 1341.  Nevertheless, the court dismissed the suit based on the more embracive comity doctrine, which restrains federal courts from entertaining claims that risk disrupting state tax administration, see Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Courts TIA holding, but reversed the courts comity ruling, and remanded for adjudication of the merits.  A footnote in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 107, n.9, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed an expansive reading of this Courts comity precedents.  The footnote stated that the Court has relied upon principles of comity to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.  Respondents challenged only a few limited exemptions, the Sixth Circuit observed, therefore their success on the merits would not significantly intrude upon Ohios administration of its tax system.  
Held:Under the comity doctrine, a taxpayers complaint of allegedly discriminatory state taxation, even when framed as a request to increase a competitors tax burden, must proceed originally in state court.  Pp.517.  
(a)The comity doctrine reflects a proper respect for the States and their institutions.  E.g., Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 112.  Comitys constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity.  States rely chiefly on taxation to fund their governments operations, therefore their tax-enforcement methods should not be interfered with absent strong cause.  See Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 110.  The TIA was enacted specifically to constrain the issuance of federal injunctions in state-tax cases, see Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 129, and is best understood as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation, National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Commn, 515 U. S. 582, 590.  Pp.58.


(b)Hibbs does not restrict comitys compass.  Plaintiffs in Hibbs were Arizona taxpayers who challenged, as violative of the Establishment Clause, a tax credit that allegedly served to support parochial  schools.  Their federal-court suit for declaratory and injunctive relief did not implicate in any way their own tax liability, and the relief they sought would not deplete the States treasury.  Rejecting Arizonas plea that the TIA barred the suit, the Court found that the case was not rationally distinguishable from pathmarking civil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained challenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a jurisdictional barrier.  542 U. S.em>., at 9394, 110112.  The Court also dispatched Arizonas comity argument in the footnote that moved the Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Courts comity-based dismissal.  Id., at 107, n.9.  Neither Hibbs nor any other decision of this Court, however, has considered the comity doctrines application to cases of the kind presented here.  Pp.810.


(c)Respondents contend that state action selects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.  Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620, 623.  When economic legislation does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights, courts generally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative choices demands.  See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S. 314, 331332.  And in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.  Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88.  Of key importance, when unlawful discrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for equal treatment.  How equality is accomplishedby extension or invalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measureis a matter on which the Constitution is silent.  See, e.g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 740.  On finding unlawful discrimination, courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.  E.g., id., at 739, n.5.  With the States legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a States tax measure, generally remands the case, leaving the interim remedial choice to state courts.  See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 3940.  If lower federal courts were to consider the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the interim remedial determination would be unavailable, for federal tribunals lack authority to remand to state court an action initiated in federal court.  Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA, which generally precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislatures design.  These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.  Pp.1013. 


(d)Comity considerations warrant dismissal of respondents suit.  If Ohios scheme is unconstitutional, the Ohio courts are better positioned to determineunless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs inhow to comply with the mandate of equal treatment.  See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 817818.  The unelaborated comity footnote in Hibbs does not counsel otherwise.  Hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case, Hibbs was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes.  Plaintiffs there were third parties whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor.  Here, by contrast, the very premise of respondents suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.  The Hibbs footnote is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as that case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity.  Respondents argument that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief sought is unavailing.  Even if their claims had merit, respondents would not be entitled to their preferred remedy.  In Hibbs, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs grievance: invalidation of the tax credit at issue.  Pp.1315.


(e)In sum, a confluence of factors in this case, absent in Hibbs, leads to the conclusion that the comity doctrine controls here.  First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.  Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position.  Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options.  Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance by federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.  Pp. 1516.


(f)The Sixth Circuits concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA effectively superfluous overlooks Congress aim, in enacting the TIA, to secure the comity doctrine against diminishment.  Comity, moreover, is a prudential doctrine.  If the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the States own system.  Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory, 431 U. S. 471, 480.  P.16. 


(g)In light of the foregoing, the Court need not decide whether the TIA would itself block this suit.  Pp.1617.

See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S. 314, 331332.  And in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.  Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88.  Of key importance, when unlawful discrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for equal treatment.  How equality is accomplishedby extension or invalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measureis a matter on which the Constitution is silent.  See, e.g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 740.  On finding unlawful discrimination, courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.  E.g., id., at 739, n.5.  With the States legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a States tax measure, generally remands the case, leaving the interim remedial choice to state courts.  See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 3940.  If lower federal courts were to consider the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the interim remedial determination would be unavailable, for federal tribunals lack authority to remand to state court an action initiated in federal court.  Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA, which generally precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislatures design.  These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.  Pp.1013. 


(d)Comity considerations warrant dismissal of respondents suit.  If Ohios scheme is unconstitutional, the Ohio courts are better positioned to determineunless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs inhow to comply with the mandate of equal treatment.  See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 817818.  The unelaborated comity footnote in Hibbs does not counsel otherwise.  Hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case, Hibbs was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes.  Plaintiffs there were third parties whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor.  Here, by contrast, the very premise of respondents suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.  The Hibbs footnote is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as that case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity.  Respondents argument that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief sought is unavailing.  Even if their claims had merit, respondents would not be entitled to their preferred remedy.  In Hibbs, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs grievance: invalidation of the tax credit at issue.  Pp.1315.


(e)In sum, a confluence of factors in this case, absent in Hibbs, leads to the conclusion that the comity doctrine controls here.  First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.  Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position.  Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options.  Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance by federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.  Pp. 1516.


(f)The Sixth Circuits concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA effectively superfluous overlooks Congress aim, in enacting the TIA, to secure the comity doctrine against diminishment.  Comity, moreover, is a prudential doctrine.  If the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the States own system.  Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory, 431 U. S. 471, 480.  P.16. 


(g)In light of the foregoing, the Court need not decide whether the TIA would itself block this suit.  Pp.1617.

09-337|"KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S.p. A.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 09337.Argued April 21, 2010Decided June 7, 2010
Petitioner Krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a cruise ship.  Her passenger ticket, which was issued by Costa Cruise Lines, identified respondent Costa Crociere S.p.A. as the carrier; required an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written notice of a claim; required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of the injury; and designated a specific Federal District Court as the exclusive forum for lawsuits such as Krupskis.  The front of the ticket listed Costa Cruises Florida address and made references to Costa Cruises.  After Krupskis attorney notified Costa Cruise of her claims but did not reach a settlement, Krupski filed a diversity negligence action against Costa Cruise.  Over the next several monthsafter the limitations period had expiredCosta Cruise brought Costa Crocieres existence to Krupskis attention three times, including in its motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant.  Krupski responded and moved to amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant.  The District Court denied Costa Cruises summary judgment motion without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend.  After she served Costa Crociere with an amended complaint, the court dismissed Costa Cruise from the case.  Thereafter, Costa Crociererepresented by the same counsel as Costa Cruisemoved to dismiss, contending that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which governs when an amended pleading relates back to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limitations period.  The Rule requires, inter alia, that within the Rule 4(m) 120-day period for service after a complaint is filed, the newly named defendant knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper partys identity.  Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).  The District Court found this condition fatal to Krupskis attempt to relate back.  It concluded that she had not made a mistake about the proper partys identity because, although Costa Cruise had disclosed Costa Crocieres role in several court filings, she nonetheless delayed for months filing an amended complaint.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crocieres identity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended.  It was therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one potential party over another.  Additionally, the court held that relation back was not appropriate because of Krupskis undue delay in seeking to amend the complaint.
Held:Relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending partys knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.  Pp.718.
(a)The Rules text does not support the Eleventh Circuits decision to rely on the plaintiffs knowledge in denying relation back.  The question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or should have known Costa Crocieres identity as the proper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known during the Rule 4(m) period that it would have been named as the defendant but for an error.  The plaintiffs information is relevant only if it bears on the defendants understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper partys identity.  It would be error to conflate knowledge of a partys existence with the absence of mistake.  That a plaintiff knows of a partys existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that partys identity.  Making a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be the antithesis of making a mistake, but that does not mean that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake.  A plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper partys identity.  That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied.  This reading is consistent with relation backs purpose of  balancing the defendants interests protected by the statute of limitations with the preference of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits.  It is also consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  And it is not foreclosed by Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460.  Pp.713.


(b)The Eleventh Circuit also erred in ruling that Krupskis undue delay in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended complaint justified its denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  The Rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation back, and the plaintiffs diligence is not among them.  Moreover, it mandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied; it does not leave that decision to the district courts equitable discretion.  Its mandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry under Rule 15(a), which gives a district court discretion to decide whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial.  See Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182.  Rule 15(c)(1)(C) permits a court to examine a plaintiffs conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but only to the extent the plaintiffs postfiling conduct informs the prospective defendants understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a mistake concerning the proper partys identity.  The plaintiffs postfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the relation-back question.  Pp.1315.


(c)Under these principles, the courts below erred in denying relation back.  Because the original complaint (of which Costa Crociere had constructive notice) made clear that Krupski meant to sue the company that owned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled the ship on which she was injured and also indicated (mistakenly) that Costa Cruise performed those roles, Costa Crociere should have known that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because of Krupskis misunderstanding about which Costa entity was in charge of the shipclearly a mistake concerning the proper partys identity.  That Krupski may have known the tickets contents does not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the two companies identities.  Especially because the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding, respondents contention that it was entitled to think she made no mistake is not persuasive.  Moreover, respondent has articulated no strategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.  Nothing in Krupskis conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a mistake.  The interrelationship between Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere and their similar names heighten the expectation that Costa Crociere should suspect a mistake when Costa Cruise is named in a complaint actually describing Costa Crocieres activities.  In addition, Costa Crocieres own actions contributed to passenger confusion over the proper party: The front of the ticket advertises that Costa Cruises has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying which Costa company is meant.  And as shown in similar lawsuits, Costa Crociere is evidently well aware that the difference between it and Costa Cruise can be confusing for passengers.  Pp.1518.

08-1301|"CARR v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 081301.Argued February 24, 2010Decided June 1, 2010
Enacted in 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) makes it a federal crime for, inter alia, any person (1) who is required to register under [SORNA], and (2) who travels in interstate or foreign commerce, to (3) knowingly fai[l] to register or update a registration, 18 U. S.C. 2250(a).  Before SORNAs enactment, petitioner Carr, a registered sex offender in Alabama, relocated to Indiana without complying with the latter States registration requirements.  Carr was indicted under 2250 post-SORNA.  The Federal District Court denied Carrs motion to dismiss, which asserted that the 2250 prosecution would violate the Constitutions ExPost Facto Clause because he had traveled to Indiana before SORNAs effective date.  Carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.  Affirming the conviction, the Seventh Circuit held that 2250 does not require that a defendants travel postdate SORNA and that reliance on a defendants pre-SORNA travel poses no expost facto problem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register post-SORNA but failed to do so, as had Carr.  
Held:Section 2250 does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred before SORNAs effective date.  Pp.518.
(a)The Court rejects the Governments view that 2250(a) requires a sex-offense conviction, subsequent interstate travel, and then a failure to register, and that only the last of these events must occur after SORNA took effect.  The Court instead accepts Carrs interpretation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person, after becoming subject to SORNAs registration requirements, travels across state lines and then fails to register.  That interpretation better accords with 2250(a)s text, the first element of which can only be satisfied when a person is required to register under SORNA.  2250(a)(1).  That 2250 sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense (travels) rather than in the past or present perfect (traveled or has traveled) reinforces this conclusion.  See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333.  And because the Dictionary Acts provision that statutory words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present, 1 U. S.C. 1, implies that the present tense generally does not include the past, regulating a person who travels is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect.  Indeed, there appears to be no instance in which this Court has construed a present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.  The statutory context also supports a forward-looking construction of travels.  First, the word travels is followed in 2250(a)(2)(B) by a series of other present tense verbsenters or leaves, or resides.  A statutes undeviating use of the present tense is a striking indic[ator] of its prospective orientation.  Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 59.  Second, the other elements of a 2250 violation are similarly set forth in the present tense: Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who is required to register under [SORNA] and who knowingly fails to register or update a registration.  (Emphasis added.)  Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy 2250s first two requirements but not the third, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses, as it has in numerous other federal statutes.  Pp.511. 


(b)The Governments two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover pre-SORNA travel are unpersuasive.  Pp.1118.


(1)The claim that such a reading avoids an anomaly in the statutes coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.  Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to SORNAs registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender by reason of a conviction under Federal law , 2250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under SORNA who travels in interstate or foreign commerce, 2250(a)(2)(B).  The Governments assertion that 2250(a)(2)s jurisdictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit.  It is entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNAs registration requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.  It is similarly reasonable for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after SORNAs enactment, they use interstate commerce channels to evade a States reach.  The Seventh Circuit erred in analogizing 2250 to 18 U. S.C. 922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from possess[ing] in  commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.  According to the lower court, 2250(a), like 922(g), uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a temporal requirement.  However, the proper analogy here is not between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but between the sex offender who travels and the convicted felon who possesses.  The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for 2250, but it is also, like the act of possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.  Pp.1114. 


(2)Also unavailing is the Governments invocation of one of SORNAs purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by their registration obligations.  The Governments argument confuses SORNAs general goal with 2250s specific purpose.  Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.  By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not 2250, stand at the center of Congress effort to account for missing sex offenders.  While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under 2250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.  Taking account of SORNAs overall structure, there is little reason to doubt that Congress intended 2250 to do exactly what it says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNAs registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.  Pp.1417. 


(3)None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evidence of SORNAs purpose calls this reading into question.  To the contrary, the House Judiciary Committees Report suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Congress goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt.  Pp.1718.


(c)Because 2250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the ExPost Facto Clause.  P.18.  
551 F.3d 578, reversed and remanded.

Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to SORNAs registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender by reason of a conviction under Federal law , 2250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under SORNA who travels in interstate or foreign commerce, 2250(a)(2)(B).  The Governments assertion that 2250(a)(2)s jurisdictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit.  It is entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNAs registration requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.  It is similarly reasonable for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after SORNAs enactment, they use interstate commerce channels to evade a States reach.  The Seventh Circuit erred in analogizing 2250 to 18 U. S.C. 922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from possess[ing] in  commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.  According to the lower court, 2250(a), like 922(g), uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a temporal requirement.  However, the proper analogy here is not between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but between the sex offender who travels and the convicted felon who possesses.  The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for 2250, but it is also, like the act of possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.  Pp.1114. 


(2)Also unavailing is the Governments invocation of one of SORNAs purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by their registration obligations.  The Governments argument confuses SORNAs general goal with 2250s specific purpose.  Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.  By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not 2250, stand at the center of Congress effort to account for missing sex offenders.  While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under 2250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.  Taking account of SORNAs overall structure, there is little reason to doubt that Congress intended 2250 to do exactly what it says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNAs registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.  Pp.1417. 


(3)None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evidence of SORNAs purpose calls this reading into question.  To the contrary, the House Judiciary Committees Report suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Congress goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt.  Pp.1718.


(c)Because 2250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the ExPost Facto Clause.  P.18.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 081341.Argued February 24, 2010Decided May 24, 2010
Respondent Marcus was convicted of engaging in forced labor and sex trafficking between January 1999 and October 2001.  On appeal, he pointed out for the first time that the federal statutes he violated did not become law until October 2000.  Thus, he claimed, the indictment and evidence permitted at trial allowed a jury to convict him exclusively on the basis of preenactment conduct in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  He conceded that he had not raised this objection in the District Court, but argued that because the constitutional error was plain, his conviction must be set aside.  The Second Circuit agreed and vacated the conviction.  In doing so, the court held that, even in the case of a continuing offense, retrial is necessary if there is any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.  The court noted that this was true even under plain error review.
Held:The Second Circuits plain-error standard conflicts with this Courts interpretation of the plain-error rule.  An appellate court may recognize a plain error that affects substantial rights, even if that error was not brought to the district courts attention.  Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  This Courts cases interpret this rule such that an appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only when the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious; (3) the error affected the appellants substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.


The standard the Second Circuit applied in this case is inconsistent with the third and fourth of these criteria.  To begin, it is irreconcilable with the criterion that the error affec[t] the appellants substantial rights, Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  This condition requires the error to be prejudicial, meaning that there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the trials outcome, not that there is any possibility, however remote, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on preenactment conduct.


Nor does this error fall within the category of structural errors that may affect substantial rights regardless of their actual impact on an appellants trial.  Id., at ___.  Here, a jury instruction might have minimized or eliminated the risk that Marcus would have been convicted based solely on preenactment conduct.  A reviewing court should find it no more difficult to assess the failure to give such an instruction than to assess numerous other instructional errors previously found nonstructural, see, e.g., Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (per curiam).  The Court further rejects Marcus argument that the error at issue should be labeled an ExPost Facto Clause violation, and that all such violations should be treated as special, structural errors warranting reversal without a showing of prejudice.  As an initial matter, the Government never argued that the statute that criminalized Marcus conduct applied retroactively, and Marcus claim is thus properly brought under the Due Process, and not the ExPost Facto, Clause.  Moreover, we see no reason why errors similar to the one at issue in this case, taken as a class, would automatically affect substantial rights without a showing of prejudice.


In any event, the Second Circuits any possibility, however remote, standard also cannot be reconciled with the criterion that the error seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Puckett, supra, at ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under the Second Circuits approach, a retrial would be required even where the evidence supporting conviction consists of a few days of preenactment conduct along with several continuous years of identical postenactment conduct.  Given the tiny risk that a jury would base its conviction in these circumstances on the few preenactment days alone, such an error is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial system.

08-661|"AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08661.Argued January 13, 2010Decided May 24, 2010
Respondent National Football League (NFL) is an unincorporated association of 32 separately owned professional football teams, also respondents here.  The teams, each of which owns its own name, colors, logo, trademarks, and related intellectual property, formed respondent National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license, and market that property.  At first, NFLP granted nonexclusive licenses to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell team-labeled apparel.  In December 2000, however, the teams authorized NFLP to grant exclusive licenses.  NFLP granted an exclusive license to respondent Reebok International Ltd. to produce and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams.  When petitioners license was not renewed, it filed this action alleging that the agreements between respondents violated the Sherman Act, 1 of which makes [e]very contract, combination  or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade illegal.  Respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within 1s meaning because the NFL and its teams are, in antitrust law jargon, a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged.  The District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond 1s coverage.  Pp.420.
(a)The meaning of contract, combination  , or, conspiracy in 1 of the Sherman Act is informed by the Acts basic distinction between concerted and independent action.  Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 767.  Section 1 treat[s] concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior, id., at 768, because, unlike independent action, [c]oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk insofar as it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands, id., at 768769.  And because concerted action is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct.  That creates less risk of deterring a firms necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete agreements.  An arrangement must therefore embody concerted action in order to be a contract, combination  or, conspiracy under 1.  Pp.46. 


(b)In determining whether there is concerted action under 1, the Court has eschewed formalistic distinctions, such as whether the alleged conspirators are legally distinct entities, in favor of a functional consideration of how they actually operate.  The Court has repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated 1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity.  See, e.g., United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 352356.  Conversely, the Court has found that although the entities may be separate for purposes of incorporation or formal title, if they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power, an agreement between them does not constitute a contract, combination  or, conspiracy.  Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 769.  Pp.610. 


(c)The relevant inquiry is therefore one of substance, not form, which does not turn on whether the alleged parties to contract, combination, or conspiracy are part of a legally single entity or seem like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense.  The inquiry is whether the agreement in question joins together separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests, Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 768, such that it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking, id., at 769, and therefore of diversity of entrepreneurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition.  If it does, then there is concerted action covered by 1, and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore illegal.  Pp.1011. 


(d)The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.  Each of them is a substantial, independently owned, independently managed business, whose general corporate actions are guided or determined by separate corporate consciousnesses, and whose objectives are not common.  Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 771.  They compete with one another, not only on the playing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts, and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel.  See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249.  Directly relevant here, the teams are potentially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.  When teams license such property, they are not pursuing the common interests of the whole league, but, instead, the interests of each corporation itself.  Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 770.  It is not dispositive, as respondents argue, that, by forming NFLP, they have formed a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands through a single outlet.  Although the NFL respondents may be similar in some sense to a single enterprise, they are not similar in the relevant functional sense.  While teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned.  Nor does it matter that the teams may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other forms of entertainment.  Although decisions made by NFLP are not as easily classified as concerted activity, the NFLPs decisions about licensing the teams separately owned intellectual property are concerted activity and thus covered by 1 for the same reason that decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by 1.  In making the relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is an instrumentality of the teams.  Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352354.  Pp.1117. 


(e)Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law.  The fact that the NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate to produce games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions.  Because some of these restraints on competition are necessary to produce the NFLs product, the Rule of Reason generally should apply, and teams cooperation is likely to be permissible.  And depending upon the activity in question, the Rule of Reason can at times be applied without detailed analysis.  But the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activity covered for 1 purposes.  Pp.1819.
538 F.3d 736, reversed and remanded.
Stevens, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

08-974|"LEWIS etal. v. CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08974.Argued February 22, 2010Decided May 24, 2010
In 1995, respondent the City of Chicago gave a written examination to applicants seeking firefighter positions.  In January 1996, the City announced it would draw candidates randomly from a list of applicants who scored at least 89 out of 100 points on the examination, whom it designated as well qualified.  It informed those who scored below 65 that they had failed and would not be considered further.  It informed applicants who scored between 65 and 88, whom it designated as qualified, that it was unlikely they would be called for further processing but that the City would keep them on the eligibility list for as long as that list was used.  That May, the City selected its first class of applicants to advance, and it repeated this process multiple times over the next six years.  Beginning in March 1997, several African-American applicants who scored in the qualified range but had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue letters.  They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the Citys practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above had a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(k)(1)(A)(i).  The District Court certified a classpetitioners hereof African-Americans who scored in the qualified range but were not hired.  The court denied the Citys summary judgment motion, rejecting its claim that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300 days after the unlawful employment practice occurred, 2000e5(e)(1), and finding instead that the Citys ongoing reliance on the 1995 test results constituted a continuing Title VII violation.  The litigation then proceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits.  The Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding that the suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory actsorting the scores into the well qualified, qualified, and not qualified categories.  The later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were an automatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory acts.
Held:A plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the employers later application of that practice as long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.  Pp.411.
(a)Determining whether petitioners charges were timely requires identify[ing] precisely the unlawful employment practice of which they complain.  Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257.  With the exception of the first selection round, all agree that the challenged practice herethe Citys selection of firefighter hires on the basis announced in 1996occurred within the charging period.  Thus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a disparate-impact claim at all.  It can.  A Title VII plaintiff establishes a prima facie claim by showing that the employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on one of the prohibited bases.  2000e2(k).  The term employment practice clearly encompasses the conduct at issue: exclusion of passing applicants who scored below 89 when selecting those who would advance.  The City use[d] that practice each time it filled a new class of firefighters, and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate impact.  It is irrelevant that subsection (k) does not address accrual of disparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the claims accrued but whether the claims stated a violation.  They did.  Whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.  Pp.47.


(b)The City argues that the only actionable discrimination occurred in 1996 when it used the test results to create the hiring list, which it concedes was unlawful.  It may be true that the Citys adoption in 1996 of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding disparate-impact claim.  If so, because no timely charge was filed, the City is now entitled to treat that past act as lawful, United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558.  But it does not follow that no new violation occurredand no new claims could arisewhen the City later implemented the 1996 decision.  Evans and later cases the City cites establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a present violation within the limitations period.  For disparate-treatment claimswhich require discriminatory intentthe plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the limitations period.  But no such demonstration is needed for claims, such as this one, that do not require discriminatory intent.  Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 640.  Contrary to the Seventh Circuits reasoning, even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited discrimination, it does not follow that their reach is coextensive.  Pp.710.


(c)The City and its amici warn that this reading will result in a host of practical problems for employers and employees alike.  The Court, however, must give effect to the law Congress enacted, not assess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.  Pp.1011.


(d)It is left to the Seventh Circuit to determine whether the judgment must be modified to the extent that the District Court awarded relief based on the first round of hiring, which occurred outside the charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge.  P.11.
528 F.3d 488, reversed and remanded.

It informed applicants who scored between 65 and 88, whom it designated as qualified, that it was unlikely they would be called for further processing but that the City would keep them on the eligibility list for as long as that list was used.  That May, the City selected its first class of applicants to advance, and it repeated this process multiple times over the next six years.  Beginning in March 1997, several African-American applicants who scored in the qualified range but had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue letters.  They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the Citys practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above had a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(k)(1)(A)(i).  The District Court certified a classpetitioners hereof African-Americans who scored in the qualified range but were not hired.  The court denied the Citys summary judgment motion, rejecting its claim that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300 days after the unlawful employment practice occurred, 2000e5(e)(1), and finding instead that the Citys ongoing reliance on the 1995 test results constituted a continuing Title VII violation.  The litigation then proceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits.  The Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding that the suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory actsorting the scores into the well qualified, qualified, and not qualified categories.  The later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were an automatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory acts.
Held:A plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the employers later application of that practice as long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.  Pp.411.
(a)Determining whether petitioners charges were timely requires identify[ing] precisely the unlawful employment practice of which they complain.  Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257.  With the exception of the first selection round, all agree that the challenged practice herethe Citys selection of firefighter hires on the basis announced in 1996occurred within the charging period.  Thus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a disparate-impact claim at all.  It can.  A Title VII plaintiff establishes a prima facie claim by showing that the employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on one of the prohibited bases.  2000e2(k).  The term employment practice clearly encompasses the conduct at issue: exclusion of passing applicants who scored below 89 when selecting those who would advance.  The City use[d] that practice each time it filled a new class of firefighters, and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate impact.  It is irrelevant that subsection (k) does not address accrual of disparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the claims accrued but whether the claims stated a violation.  They did.  Whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.  Pp.47.


(b)The City argues that the only actionable discrimination occurred in 1996 when it used the test results to create the hiring list, which it concedes was unlawful.  It may be true that the Citys adoption in 1996 of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding disparate-impact claim.  If so, because no timely charge was filed, the City is now entitled to treat that past act as lawful, United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558.  But it does not follow that no new violation occurredand no new claims could arisewhen the City later implemented the 1996 decision.  Evans and later cases the City cites establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a present violation within the limitations period.  For disparate-treatment claimswhich require discriminatory intentthe plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the limitations period.  But no such demonstration is needed for claims, such as this one, that do not require discriminatory intent.  Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 640.  Contrary to the Seventh Circuits reasoning, even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited discrimination, it does not follow that their reach is coextensive.  Pp.710.


(c)The City and its amici warn that this reading will result in a host of practical problems for employers and employees alike.  The Court, however, must give effect to the law Congress enacted, not assess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.  Pp.1011.


(d)It is left to the Seventh Circuit to determine whether the judgment must be modified to the extent that the District Court awarded relief based on the first round of hiring, which occurred outside the charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge.  P.11.

09-448|"HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 09448.Argued April 26, 2010Decided May 24, 2010
After medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she filed for long-term disability benefits under her employers long-term disability plan.  Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt sued respondent Reliance, her employers disability insurance carrier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits claim.  The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, finding that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical information, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that it found compelling evidence in the record that she was totally disabled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.  The court therefore remanded to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act on Hardts application, or else the court would enter judgment in Hardts favor.  Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt benefits.  Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S.C. 1132(g)(1), a fee-shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides that the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorneys fee and costs  to either party.  Granting the motion, the District Court applied the Circuits framework governing attorneys fee requests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had attained the requisite prevailing party status.  The Fourth Circuit vacated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that she qualified as a prevailing party under the rule set forth in Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a prevailing party only if he has obtained an enforceable judgmen[t] on the merits or a court-ordered consent decre[e].  The court reasoned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment on the merits.  
Held: 
1.A fee claimant need not be a prevailing party to be eligible for an attorneys fees award under 1132(g)(1).  Interpreting the section to require a party to attain that status is contrary to 1132(g)(1)s plain text.  The words prevailing party do not appear in the provision.  Nor does anything else in 1132(g)(1)s text purport to limit the availability of attorneys fees to a prevailing party.  Instead, 1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts discretion to award attorneys fees to either party.  (Emphasis added.)  That language contrasts sharply with 1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of attorneys fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer contributions to a multiemployer plan.  In such cases, only plaintiffs who obtain a judgment in favor of the plan may seek attorneys fees.  1132(g)(2)(D).  The contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorneys fees in ERISA cases.  Because Congress failed to include in 1132(g)(1) an express prevailing party requirement, the Fourth Circuits decision adding that term of art to the statute more closely resembles invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing] one. Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359.  Pp.89.   


2.A court may award fees and costs under 1132(g)(1), as long as the fee claimant has achieved some degree of success on the merits.  Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694.  The bedrock principle known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of reference: Each litigant pays his own attorneys fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.  E.g., id., at 683686.  This Courts prevailing party precedents do not govern here because that term of art does not appear in 1132(g)(1).  Instead, the Court interprets 1132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorneys fees based on other criteria.  Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authorizing a fees award if the court determines that such an award is appropriate, 42 U. S.C. 7607(f), is the principal case in that category.  Applying that decisions interpretive approach to 29 U. S.C. 1132(g)(1), the Court first looks to the language of the section, 463 U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attorneys fees in its discretion  to either party.  Ruckelshaus also lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discretion.  Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed to indicate clearly that it meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and intuitive notions of fairness, 463 U. S., at 686, a fees claimant must show some degree of success on the merits before a court may award attorneys fees under 1132(g)(1), see id., at 694.  Hardt has satisfied that standard.  Though she failed to win summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that it was inclined to rule in her favor.  She also obtained the remand order, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, reversed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought.  Accordingly, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award Hardt attorneys fees.  Pp.913.

09-8852|"LAWRENCE JOSEPH JEFFERSON v. STEPHEN
UPTON, WARDEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 098852.Decided May 24, 2010
Per Curiam.

Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced to death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suffered as a child.  The state court rejected that claim after making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such investigation was unnecessary.  Under the governing federal statute, that factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.  See 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1)(8) (1994 ed.).  But the Court of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifically 2254(d)(8)).  And on that basis, it considered itself duty-bound to accept the state courts finding, and rejected Jeffersons claim.  Because the Court of Appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.
I

When Jefferson was a child, he suffered a serious injury to his head.  Jefferson v. Terry, 490 F.Supp. 2d 1261, 1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see id., at 1320 (quoting Jeffersons mothers testimony that a car ran over the top of his head when he was two years old).  The accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly scarred.  Jefferson v. Hall, 570 F.3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n.4 (CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting).  During the District Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified that, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has permanent brain damage that causes abnormal behavior over which he has no or substantially limited control.  490 F.Supp. 2d, at 13211322.  According to these experts, Jeffersons condition causes emotional dullness, restless or aggressive characteristics, impulsiveness, temper outbursts, markedly diminished impulse control, impaired social judgment, and transient outbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his normal behavioral pattern.  Id., at 1322, 1327.
The experts further testified that Jeffersons severe cognitive disabilities profoundly alter his ability to plan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the consequences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or intentional acts.  Id., at 1327.  But they testified he is neither psychotic nor retarded.  Id., at 1319.  Thus, they said, to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired.  Indeed, according to the experts, the behavior that may result from his condition could, without the administration of proper testing, be mistaken for volitional.  Id., at 1322.


Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co-worker while the two men were fishing.  Id., at 12711272.  Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named Dr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which he concluded that Jeffersons mental deficiencies do not impair his judgment or decision-making capacity.  570 F.3d, at 1294 (quoting report).  But Dr. Dudleys report included a caveat: One possibility that could not be explored because of [Jeffersons] incarceration has to do with the sequelae, i.e., pathologies, related to a head injury experienced during childhood.  Ibid.  In my opinion, he wrote, it would be worthwhile to conduct neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out an organic etiology, i.e., to rule out brain damage.  Ibid.


Although it is undisputed that the testing Dr. Dudley recommended could have easily been performed, 490 F.Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jeffersons attorneys possessed police reports and hospital records recounting his head injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jefferson tested.  At sentencing, they presented only testimony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson was an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of Jeffersons family, who testified that he is a responsible, generous, gentle, and kind person and a good father.  570 F.3d, at 12901291.  And while Jeffersons mother briefly mentioned the car accident, she was not questioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the impact, if any, that the accident had on him.  Id., at 1291.  Thus, [a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer from brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no organic disorders; and his emotional stability, impulse control, and judgment were perfectly normal.  Id., at 1311 (Carnes, J., dissenting).


Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue brain-damage testing.  In response, the trial attorneys testified that they did not pursue such testing because, after delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later told them that further investigation may be a waste of time because the rest of [his] report had said that [Jefferson] was non psychotic.  570 F.3d, at 1295 (quoting testimony).  Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the hearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements.  He said it had always been his expert opinion that neuropsychological testing was necessary and that when he wrote as much in his formal report he meant it.  Id., at 1312 (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit).  He added, I never, before or after that report, suggested to [Jeffersons attorneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it would not be worthwhile.  Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17, n.12.


Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that after the hearing concluded the state-court judge contacted the attorneys for the State ex parte.  And in a private conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his attorneys, the judge asked the States attorneys to draft the opinion of the court.  See id., at 3, 12.  According to Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he informed of the request made to opposing counsel.  Id., at 12, n.8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, 263 Ga. 316, 431 S.E.2d 110, 111 (1993) (Jefferson contends [the order] amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which [he] has not had a chance to respond).


The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding that Dr. Dudley led [Jeffersons trial attorneys] to believe that further investigation would simply be a waste of time because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.  Jefferson v. Zant, Civ. Action No. 87V1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Oct. 7, 1992), p.16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter State Order); see also id., at 37.  The opinion specifically credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to their efforts to investigate Petitioners mental condition.  Id., at 18; see also id., at 36.  And relying on these findings, it concludes that Jeffersons attorneys made a reasonable investigation into [his] mental health and were thus not ineffective.  Id., at 37.


Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged, the States opinion discusses statements purportedly made on Jeffersons behalf by a witness who did not testify or participate in the proceedings.  263 Ga., at 318, 431 S.E. 2d, at 112; see State Order 2425.  Nonetheless, the opinion was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.  263 Ga., at 316, 431 S.E. 2d, at 111.  And while the State Supreme Court recognized that we have criticized such a practice, it affirmed the judgment.  Id., at 317, 320, 431 S.E. 2d, at 112, 114 (quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 572 (1985)).
II

Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the District Court.  In his opening brief, he argued that there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus Court.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96CV989CC (ND Ga.), Doc. 105, p.4, and n.1 (hereinafter District Court Brief).  In support of that argument, he claimed that the state court merely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word, even though the order described witnesses who never testified.  Ibid.  And he said that such a process rais[es] serious doubts as to whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State.  Ibid.
The District Court ruled in Jeffersons favor.  It noted that under the relevant statute factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless one of  eight enumerated exceptions  applies. 490 F.Supp. 2d, at 1280; see also id., at 1280, n.5 (listing the exceptions).  And it acknowledged the state habeas corpus courts failure to explain the basis for its credibility findings.  Id., at 1324, n.17.  But it accepted Jeffersons claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the state courts factual findings because it believed he should prevail even accepting those findings as true.  Id., at 13241325.


On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Courts judgment primarily on its own terms.  But he also argued that the state courts factfinding was dubious at best in light of the process that court employed, and that the Court of Appeals therefore should harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state court record.  Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 0712502 (CA11), pp. 3132, n.10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).


A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  And, in so doing, he challengesas he did in the State Supreme Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appealsthe fact findings of the state court, given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing his claim.  Pet. for Cert. 1113, 17, n.12, 18, n.13 (recounting reason[s] to doubt the state courts findings).  Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving an issue for review in this Court).
III

This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it existed prior to that point.  Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326336 (1997).  In 1963, we set forth the appropriate standard to be applied by a federal court in habeas corpus when the facts pertinent to a habeas application are in dispute.  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.  We held that when the habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings the district court ordinarily should  accept the facts as found by the state-court judge.  Id., at 318.  However, if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding, we held that the federal court must hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve any facts that are in dispute.  Id., at 312.  We further explain[ed] the controlling criteria by enumerating six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hearing would be required:
(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.  Id., at 313 (emphasis added).
Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an amendment to the federal habeas statute that was an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated in Townsend v. Sain.  Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111 (1985).  That codification read in relevant part as follows:
In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination  of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction  , shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit


(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the State court hearing;


(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;


(3) that the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing;


(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the State court proceeding;


(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right, failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State court proceeding;


(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or


(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the State court proceeding;


(8) or unless  the Federal court on a consideration of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.  2254(d) (emphasis added).

As is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as the District Court correctly stated, if any one of the eight enumerated exceptions  applies then the state courts factfinding is not presumed correct. 490 F.Supp. 2d, at 1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (Under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d), state-court findings of fact shall be presumed to be correct in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies); see also 1 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure 20.2c, pp. 915918 (5th ed. 2005).


Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts should harbor serious doubts about and should not give any deference to the findings of fact and credibility determinations made by the state habeas court because those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys for the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the state-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson, failed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing counsel, and adopted the States proposed opinion verbatim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent witness.  See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n.10; District Court Brief 4, n.1; Pet. for Cert. 12.  These are arguments that the state courts process was deficient.  In other words, they are arguments that Jefferson did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in  state court.  Townsend, supra, at 312.  Or, to use the statutory language, they are arguments that the state courts factfinding procedure, hearing, and proceeding were not full, fair, and adequate.  2254(d)(2), (6), (7).


But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state courts process when it applied the statutory presumption of correctness.  Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of 2254(d), which, codifying the second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the presumption of correctness for findings that are not fairly supported by the record.  See 570 F.3d, at 1300 (quoting Jackson v. Herring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in turn quoting 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(8)).  And even though the Court of Appeals recognize[d] that Jefferson had argued that the state courts process had produced factual findings that were dubious at best, and that federal courts should therefore harbor serious doubts about the state courts findings of fact and credibility, the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state courts findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness that it was duty-bound to apply.  570 F.3d, at 1304, n.8 (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n.10).  The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that it considered itself duty-bound to defer to the state courts findings because Jefferson has not argued that any of the state courts factual findings were not fairly supported by the record, a direct reference to 2254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception.  570 F.3d, at 1304, n.8 (emphasis added).  And it then concluded: Based on these factual findings of the state habeas courtsall of which are fairly supported by the recordwe believe that Jeffersons counsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.  Id., at 1304 (emphasis added).


In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly consider the legal status of the state courts factual findings.  Under Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a federal court is not duty-bound to accept any and all state-court findings that are fairly supported by the record.  Those words come from 2254(d)(8), which is only one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness.  But there are seven others, see 2254(d)(1)(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when addressing Jeffersons claim.  To be sure, we have previously stated in cases applying 2254(d)(8) that a federal court may not overturn a state courts factual conclusion unless the conclusion is not fairly supported by the record.  Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state courts finding under 2254(d)(8)); see also  Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying 2254(d)(8)); cf. post, at 10 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But in those cases there was no suggestion that any other provisions enumerated in 2254(d) were at issue.  That is not the case here.  In treating 2254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory exception, and by failing to address Jeffersons argument that the state courts procedures deprived its findings of deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.


Although we have stated that a courts verbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties should be treated as findings of the court, we have also criticized that practice.  Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572.  And we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the application of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte, (2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them.  Cf. id., at 568; Ga. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibiting ex parte judicial communications).


We decline to determine in the first instance whether any of the exceptions enumerated in 2254(d)(1)(8) apply in this case, see, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n.7 (2005), especially given that the facts surrounding the state habeas courts process are undeveloped.  Respondent has conceded that it drafted the state courts final order at that courts request and that the order was adopted verbatim, 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S.E. 2d, at 111, and has not disputed in this Court that the state court solicited the order ex parte and without prior notice and did not seek a proposed order from Petitioner, Pet. for Cert. 12, and n.8.  But the precise nature of what transpired during the state-court proceedings is not fully known.  See 263 Ga. at 316317, 431 S.E. 2d, at 111 (noting dispute as to whether Jefferson had a chance to respond to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.


Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts to determine on remand whether the state courts factual findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of their resolution of that issue.  See Townsend, supra, at 313319; Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992).  In so holding, we express no opinion as to whether Jeffersons Sixth Amendment rights were violated assuming the state courts factual findings to be true.
***

The petition for a writ of certiorari and motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

08-1224|"UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 081224.Argued January 12, 2010Decided May 17, 2010
Federal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he would otherwise be released.  18 U. S.C. 4248.  The Government instituted civil-commitment proceedings under 4248 against respondents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 18.  Agreeing, the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed on the legislative-power ground.  
Held:The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority sufficient to enact 4248.  Taken together, five considerations compel this conclusion.  Pp.522. 
(1)The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in furtherance of its constitutionally enumerated powers.  It makes clear that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied by broad power to enact laws that are convenient, or useful or conducive to the enumerated powers beneficial exercise, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 418, and that Congress can legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved in the constitution, id., at 421.  In determining whether the Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be means-ends rationality between the enacted statute and the source of federal power.  Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605.  The Constitution addresse[s] the choice of means primarily  to the judgment of Congress.  If it can be seen that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone.  Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 547548.  Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifically enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority to do each of those things under the Clause.  Pp.59. 


(2)Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil commitment.  See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S.C. 42414247.  A longstanding history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statutes constitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Commn of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 678, but can be helpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme, Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21, and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the new statute and pre-existing federal interests.  Section 4248 differs from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.  Many of these individuals, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under 4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise).  The similarities between 4246 and 4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework.  Pp.914.  


(3)There are sound reasons for 4248s enactment.  The Federal Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose.  Moreover, 4248 is reasonably adapted to Congress power to act as a responsible federal custodian.  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121.  Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct, 4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released.  And Congress could also have reasonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal custody.  Congress desire to address these specific challenges, taken together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the conclusion that 4248 satisfies review for means-end rationality, Sabri, supra, at 605.  Pp.1416.    


(4)Respondents contention that 4248 violates the Tenth Amendment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area typically left to state control is rejected.  That Amendment does not reserve to the States those powers that are delegated to the United States by the Constitution, including the powers delegated by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  See, e.g., New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 159.  And 4248 does not invade state sovereignty, but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the federal prisoner is domiciled or was tried of his detention, 4248(d), and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the individual, which will prompt the individuals immediate transfer to State custody, 4248(d)(1).  In Greenwood v. United States, 350 U. S. 366, 375376, the Court rejected a similar challenge to 4248s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above.  Because the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of state interests than 4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not invade state interests.  Pp.1618.    


(5)Section 4248 is narrow in scope.  The Court rejects respondents argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress authority can be no more than one step removed from a specifically enumerated power.  See, e.g., McCulloch, supra, at 417.  Nor will the Courts holding today confer on Congress a general police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States. United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618.  Section 4248 has been applied to only a small fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals already in the custody of the Federal Government, 4248(a).  Thus, far from a general police power, 4248 is a reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Governments legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison system.  See New York, supra, at 157.  Pp.1822. 


The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due process, or any other constitutional rights.  Respondents are free to pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.  P.22.

08-7412|"GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
certiorari to the district court of appeal of
florida, 1st district
No. 087412.Argued November 9, 2009Decided May 17, 2010
Petitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and another crime.  Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sentenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt.  Subsequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms of his probation by committing additional crimes.  The trial court adjudicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his probation, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary.  Because Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham no possibility of release except executive clemency.  He challenged his sentence under the Eighth Amendments Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal affirmed.  
Held:The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  Pp.731.
(a)Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the precept  that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.  Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367.  The Courts cases implementing the proportionality standard fall within two general classifications.  In cases of the first type, the Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for a particular defendants crime. The second classification comprises cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against the death penalty.  In a subset of such cases considering the nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals.  E.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  In a second subset, cases turning on the offenders characteristics, the Court has prohibited death for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304.  In cases involving categorical rules, the Court first considers objective indicia of societys standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.  Roper, supra, at 563.  Next, looking to the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Courts own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendments text, history, meaning, and purpose, Kennedy, supra, at ___, the Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper, supra, at 564.  Because this case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical approach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy.  Pp.710. 


(b)Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional.  Pp.1031.


(1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for any juvenile offenders.  Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes.  Thirty-seven States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in some circumstances.  The State relies on these data to argue that no national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.  An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide, there are only 129 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sentences for nonhomicide crimes.  Because 77 of those offenders are serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 52 are imprisoned in just 10 States and in the federal system, it appears that only 12 jurisdictions nationwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders, while 26 States and the District of Columbia do not impose them despite apparent statutory authorization.  Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sentences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.  While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentencing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposition.  The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the sentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not necessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have deliberately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850.  Pp.1016. 


(2)The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited culpability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead the Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel and unusual.  No recent data provide reason to reconsider Ropers holding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment.  543 U. S., at 551.  Moreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments than are murderers.  E.g., Kennedy, supra.  Serious nonhomicide crimes may be devastating in their harm  but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,  they cannot be compared to murder in their severity and irrevocability.  Id., at ___.  Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.  Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analysis.  As for the punishment, life without parole is the second most severe penalty permitted by law, Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572.  And none of the legitimate goals of penal sanctionsretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11, 25is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573.  Because age 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, it is the age below which a defendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  Id., at 574.  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that provides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.  Pp.1624. 


(3)A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two alternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional concerns.  First, although Florida and other States have made substantial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of youthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sentence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability.  Second, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offenders age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psychological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sentence from the many that have the capacity for change.  Cf. Roper, supra, at 572573.  Nor does such an approach take account of special difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation, given juveniles impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long-term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults.  A categorical rule avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.  It also gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.  Pp.2429. 


(4)Additional support for the Courts conclusion lies in the fact that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over: The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sentence.  While the judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual.  See, e.g., Roper, supra, at 575578.  Pp.2931.

No. 087412.Argued November 9, 2009Decided May 17, 2010
Petitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and another crime.  Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sentenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt.  Subsequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms of his probation by committing additional crimes.  The trial court adjudicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his probation, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary.  Because Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham no possibility of release except executive clemency.  He challenged his sentence under the Eighth Amendments Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal affirmed.  
Held:The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  Pp.731.
(a)Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the precept  that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.  Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367.  The Courts cases implementing the proportionality standard fall within two general classifications.  In cases of the first type, the Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for a particular defendants crime. The second classification comprises cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against the death penalty.  In a subset of such cases considering the nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals.  E.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  In a second subset, cases turning on the offenders characteristics, the Court has prohibited death for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304.  In cases involving categorical rules, the Court first considers objective indicia of societys standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.  Roper, supra, at 563.  Next, looking to the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Courts own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendments text, history, meaning, and purpose, Kennedy, supra, at ___, the Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper, supra, at 564.  Because this case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical approach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy.  Pp.710. 


(b)Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional.  Pp.1031.


(1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for any juvenile offenders.  Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes.  Thirty-seven States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in some circumstances.  The State relies on these data to argue that no national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.  An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide, there are only 129 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sentences for nonhomicide crimes.  Because 77 of those offenders are serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 52 are imprisoned in just 10 States and in the federal system, it appears that only 12 jurisdictions nationwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders, while 26 States and the District of Columbia do not impose them despite apparent statutory authorization.  Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sentences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.  While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentencing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposition.  The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the sentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not necessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have deliberately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850.  Pp.1016. 


(2)The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited culpability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead the Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel and unusual.  No recent data provide reason to reconsider Ropers holding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment.  543 U. S., at 551.  Moreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments than are murderers.  E.g., Kennedy, supra.  Serious nonhomicide crimes may be devastating in their harm  but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,  they cannot be compared to murder in their severity and irrevocability.  Id., at ___.  Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.  Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analysis.  As for the punishment, life without parole is the second most severe penalty permitted by law, Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572.  And none of the legitimate goals of penal sanctionsretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11, 25is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573.  Because age 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, it is the age below which a defendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  Id., at 574.  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that provides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.  Pp.1624. 


(3)A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two alternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional concerns.  First, although Florida and other States have made substantial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of youthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sentence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability.  Second, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offenders age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psychological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sentence from the many that have the capacity for change.  Cf. Roper, supra, at 572573.  Nor does such an approach take account of special difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation, given juveniles impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long-term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults.  A categorical rule avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.  It also gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.  Pp.2429. 


(4)Additional support for the Courts conclusion lies in the fact that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over: The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sentence.  While the judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual.  See, e.g., Roper, supra, at 575578.  Pp.2931.

08-9156|"WOOD v. ALLEN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 089156.Argued November 4, 2009Decided January 20, 2010
Under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2), a federal court may grant a state prisoner habeas relief if his claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court and resulted in a decision  based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  Under 2254(e)(1), a determination of a factual issue made by a State court [is] presumed to be correct, and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.


Petitioner Wood was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama state court.  Two of his court-appointed attorneys, Dozier and Ralph, had significant trial experience, but the third, Trotter, had only recently been admitted to the bar.  After exhausting his appeals, Wood sought postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, arguing, among other things, that he was mentally retarded and not eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to investigate and present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the trials penalty phase.  The Rule 32 court conducted evidentiary hearings and denied the claims initially and on remand.  As to the mental retardation claim, it found that Wood had not shown deficits in his adaptive functioning.  As to the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it concluded that he had not established that his counsels performance was deficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense.  In so doing, it made a factual finding that counsel had made a strategic decision not to pursue evidence of Woods alleged retardation.  Observing that counsel had asked Dr. Kirkland to conduct a mental evaluation, had thoroughly reviewed his report, and had determined that no further investigation was warranted, the court additionally held that counsel appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present their limited mental-deficiency evidence to the jury because having Dr. Kirkland testify was not in Woods best interest.  It also found no reasonable probability of a different outcome had the evidence developed in the Rule 32 proceedings been presented at trial.  Woods subsequently sought federal habeas relief under 2254.  The District Court rejected all but his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  The District Court concluded that the state courts finding that counsel made a strategic decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts.  The court further held that counsels performance was deficient and had prejudiced Wood, and that the state courts contrary holdings were an unreasonable application of federal law under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.  Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that the state courts rejection of Woods ineffective-assistance claim was neither an unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  With respect to the facts, it concluded that the evidence in the Rule 32 hearings supported the state courts strategic-decision finding, and it agreed with the state courts legal conclusion that counsels strategic decision was reasonable and that Wood had failed to show prejudice.  Woods certiorari petition raises the questions (1) whether, in order to obtain relief under 2254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish only that the state-court factual determination on which the decision was based was unreasonable, or whether 2254(e)(1) additionally requires a petitioner to rebut a presumption that the determination was correct with clear and convincing evidence; and (2) whether the state courts strategic-decision determination was reasonable.  
Held: 
1.Even under Woods reading of 2254(d)(2), the state courts conclusion that his counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings.  This Court need not reach the question whether 2254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge under 2254(d)(2), see Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 339, because its view of the state courts factual determination here does not depend on an interpretative difference regarding the relationship between those provisions.  While [t]he term unreasonable is  difficult to define, Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410, it suffices to say that a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.  See Rice, supra, at 341342.  Here, the state-court record shows that all of Woods counsel read the Kirkland report.  Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the report merited further investigation, a recollection supported by the attorneys contemporaneous letters; and Trotter told the sentencing judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the report to the jury.  This evidence can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 courts factual determination that counsels failure to pursue or present evidence of Woods mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but the result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses.  Most of the contrary evidence Wood highlightse.g., that Dozier and Ralph put the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase proceedingsspeaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but to whether counsels judgment was reasonable, a question not before this Court.  Any evidence plausibly inconsistent with the strategic-decision finding does not suffice to show that the finding was unreasonable.  Pp.812.


2.Because Woods argument that the state court unreasonably applied Strickland in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim on the merits is not fairly included in the questions presented under this Courts Rule 14.1(a), it will not be addressed here.  Pp.1213.
542 F.3d 1281, affirmed.

08-645|"ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 08645.Argued January 12, 2010Decided May 17, 2010
After the Abbotts, a married couple, moved to Chile and separated, the Chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their minor son, A.J.A., while awarding petitioner husband visitation rights.  Mr. Abbott also had a neexeat right to consent before Ms. Abbott could take A.J.A. out of the country under Chile Minors Law 16,618 (Minors Law 16,618), art. 49.  When Ms. Abbott brought A.J.A. to Texas without permission from Mr. Abbott or the Chilean family court, Mr. Abbott filed this suit in the Federal District Court, seeking an order requiring his sons return to Chile under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U. S.C. 11601 et seq.  Among its provisions, the Convention seeks to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained in any Contracting State, Art. 1; provides that such removal or retention  is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person  under the law of the State in which the child was [theretofore] habitually resident, Art. 3(a), and where those rights [had been] actually exercised  or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention, Art. 3(b); and defines rights of custody to include  the right to determine the childs place of residence, Art. 5(a).  The District Court denied relief, holding that the fathers ne exeat right did not constitute a righ[t] of custody under the Convention and, thus, that the return remedy was not authorized.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:A parent has a right of custody under the Convention by reason of that parents neexeat right.  Pp.417.  
(a)The Convention applies because A.J.A. is under 16; he was a habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are contracting states.  The ICARA instructs the state or federal court in which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed to decide the case in accordance with the Convention.  11603(b), (d).  P.5. 


(b)That A.J.A. was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of a righ[t] of custody is shown by the Conventions text, by the U. S. State Departments views, by contracting states court decisions, and by the Conventions purposes.  Pp.518. 


(1)Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbotts right, while the Conventions text and structure resolve whether that right is a righ[t] of custody.  Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that [o]nce the court has decreed that one of the parents has visitation rights, that parents authorization generally shall also be required before the child may be taken out of the country.  Because Mr. Abbott has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a neexeat right under article 49.  The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), and Mr. Abbotts neexeat right is best classified as a joint right of custody, which the Convention defines to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the childs place of residence, Art. 5(a).  Mr. Abbotts right to decide A.J.A.s country of residence allows him to determine the childs place of residence, especially given the Conventions purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.  It also gives him rights relating to the care of the person of the child, in that choosing A.J.A.s residence country can determine the shape of his early and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and traditions.  That a neexeat right does not fit within traditional physical-custody notions is beside the point because the Conventions definition of rights of custody controls.  This uniform, text-based approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Convention, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under other legal traditions.  In any case, this country has adopted modern conceptions of custody e.g., joint legal custody, that accord with the Conventions broad definition.  Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a neexeat right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Convention requires that any such right be capable of exercis[e].  When one parent removes a child without seeking the neexeat holders consent, it is an instance where the right would have been exercised but for the removal or retention, Art. 3(b).  The Fifth Circuits conclusion that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.  Any suggestion that a neexeat right is a right of access is atexual, as a neexeat right is not even arguably a right to take a child for a limited period of time.  Art. 5(b).  Ms. Abbotts argument that the neexeat order in this case cannot create a right of custody is not dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law 16,618, which do not derive from the order.  Pp.611. 


(2)This Courts conclusion is strongly supported and informed by the longstanding view of the State Departments Office of Childrens Issues, this countrys Convention enforcement entity, that neexeat rights are rights of custody.  The Court owes deference to the Executive Branchs treaty interpretations.  See Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185.  There is no reason to doubt this well-established canon here.  The Executive, when dealing with delicate foreign relations matters like international child abductions, possesses a great store of information on practical realities such as the reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpretation and the impact that interpretation may have on the State Departments ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.  Pp.1112.  


(3)The Courts view is also substantially informed by the views of sister contracting states on the issue, see El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 176, particularly because the ICARA directs that uniform international interpretation of the Convention is part of its framework, see 11601(b)(3)(B).  While the Supreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view, and French courts are divided, a review of the international law confirms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Austria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the Conventions meaning.  Scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus on the matter.  And the Conventions history is fully consistent with the conclusion that neexeat rights are just one of the many ways in which custody of children can be exercised.  Pp.1216. 


(4)The Courts holding also accords with the Conventions objects and purposes.  There is no reason to doubt the ability of other contracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best interests of the children.  To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a neexeat right, runs counter to the Conventions purpose of deterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier forum.  Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, removal of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent, while requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter abductions and respects the Conventions purpose to prevent harms to the child resulting from abductions.  Pp.1618. 


(c)While a parent possessing a neexeat right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be ordered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Convention exception, such as a grave risk that  return would expose the child to  harm or [an] otherwise  intolerable situation, or the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient age and degree of maturity to state a preference, Art. 13(b).  The proper interpretation and application of exceptions may be addressed on remand.  P.18.

(1)Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbotts right, while the Conventions text and structure resolve whether that right is a righ[t] of custody.  Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that [o]nce the court has decreed that one of the parents has visitation rights, that parents authorization generally shall also be required before the child may be taken out of the country.  Because Mr. Abbott has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a neexeat right under article 49.  The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), and Mr. Abbotts neexeat right is best classified as a joint right of custody, which the Convention defines to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the childs place of residence, Art. 5(a).  Mr. Abbotts right to decide A.J.A.s country of residence allows him to determine the childs place of residence, especially given the Conventions purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.  It also gives him rights relating to the care of the person of the child, in that choosing A.J.A.s residence country can determine the shape of his early and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and traditions.  That a neexeat right does not fit within traditional physical-custody notions is beside the point because the Conventions definition of rights of custody controls.  This uniform, text-based approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Convention, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under other legal traditions.  In any case, this country has adopted modern conceptions of custody e.g., joint legal custody, that accord with the Conventions broad definition.  Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a neexeat right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Convention requires that any such right be capable of exercis[e].  When one parent removes a child without seeking the neexeat holders consent, it is an instance where the right would have been exercised but for the removal or retention, Art. 3(b).  The Fifth Circuits conclusion that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.  Any suggestion that a neexeat right is a right of access is atexual, as a neexeat right is not even arguably a right to take a child for a limited period of time.  Art. 5(b).  Ms. Abbotts argument that the neexeat order in this case cannot create a right of custody is not dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law 16,618, which do not derive from the order.  Pp.611. 


(2)This Courts conclusion is strongly supported and informed by the longstanding view of the State Departments Office of Childrens Issues, this countrys Convention enforcement entity, that neexeat rights are rights of custody.  The Court owes deference to the Executive Branchs treaty interpretations.  See Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185.  There is no reason to doubt this well-established canon here.  The Executive, when dealing with delicate foreign relations matters like international child abductions, possesses a great store of information on practical realities such as the reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpretation and the impact that interpretation may have on the State Departments ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.  Pp.1112.  


(3)The Courts view is also substantially informed by the views of sister contracting states on the issue, see El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 176, particularly because the ICARA directs that uniform international interpretation of the Convention is part of its framework, see 11601(b)(3)(B).  While the Supreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view, and French courts are divided, a review of the international law confirms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Austria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the Conventions meaning.  Scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus on the matter.  And the Conventions history is fully consistent with the conclusion that neexeat rights are just one of the many ways in which custody of children can be exercised.  Pp.1216. 


(4)The Courts holding also accords with the Conventions objects and purposes.  There is no reason to doubt the ability of other contracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best interests of the children.  To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a neexeat right, runs counter to the Conventions purpose of deterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier forum.  Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, removal of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent, while requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter abductions and respects the Conventions purpose to prevent harms to the child resulting from abductions.  Pp.1618. 


(c)While a parent possessing a neexeat right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be ordered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Convention exception, such as a grave risk that  return would expose the child to  harm or [an] otherwise  intolerable situation, or the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient age and degree of maturity to state a preference, Art. 13(b).  The proper interpretation and application of exceptions may be addressed on remand.  P.18.

09-338|"RENICO, WARDEN v. LETT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 09338.Argued March 29, 2010Decided May 3, 2010
From jury selection to jury instructions in a Michigan court, respondent Letts first trial for, inter alia, first-degree murder took less than nine hours.  During approximately four hours of deliberations, the jury sent the trial court seven notes, including one asking what would happen if the jury could not agree.  The judge called the jury and the attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson, who said that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.  The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new trial.  At Letts second trial, after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15 minutes, a new jury found him guilty of second-degree murder.  On appeal, Lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from trying him a second time.  Agreeing, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  The Michigan Supreme Court reversed.  It concluded that, under United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court exercised its sound discretion in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial; and that, under Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 506510, an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judges determination that a deadlock has been reached.  It then found that the judge at Letts first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial, observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of time following a short, noncomplex trial; that the jury had sent several notes, including one appearing to indicate heated discussions; and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.  In Letts federal habeas petition, he contended that the Michigan Supreme Courts rejection of his double jeopardy claim was an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), and thus that he was not barred by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) from obtaining federal habeas relief.  The District Court granted the writ, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Because the Michigan Supreme Courts decision in this case was not unreasonable under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting Lett habeas relief.  Pp.512.
(a)The question under AEDPA is whether the Michigan Supreme Courts determination was an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, 2254(d)(1), not whether it was an incorrect application of that law, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410.  AEDPA imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n.7, and demands that [they] be given the benefit of the doubt, Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (per curiam).  Pp.56.


(b) Here, the clearly established Federal law is largely undisputed.  When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury, Perez, 9 Wheat., at 579580.  Trial judges may declare a mistrial when, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for doing so, id., at 580, i.e., a high degree of necessity, Washington, supra, at 506.  The decision whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the broad discretion of the trial judge, Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462, and the discretion to declare a mistrial [for a deadlocked jury] is  accorded great deference by a reviewing court, Washington, supra, at 510, although this deference is not absolute.  This Court has expressly declined to require the mechanical application of any rigid formula, Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 690691, when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial due to jury deadlock, and it has explicitly held that the judge is not required to make explicit findings of manifest necessity or articulate on the record all the factors informing his discretion, Washington, supra, at 517.  The Court has never required a judge in these circumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with counsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse.  Moreover, the legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme Court is a general onewhether there was an abuse of the broad discretion reserved to the trial judge, Somerville, supra, at 462.  Because AEDPA authorizes a federal court to grant relief only when a state courts application of federal law was unreasonable, it follows that [t]he more general the rule at issueand thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among fair-minded judgesthe more leeway [state] courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.  Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664.  Pp.69.


(c)The Michigan Supreme Courts adjudication involved a straightforward application of this Courts longstanding precedents to the facts of Letts case.  The state court cited this Courts double jeopardy casesfrom Perez to Washingtonapplying those precedents to the particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of the length of deliberations following a short, uncomplicated trial, the jurys notes to the judge, and the fact that the foreperson stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.  It was thus reasonable for the court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.  The Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise because it disagreed with the inferences that the Michigan Supreme Court had drawn from the facts.  The Circuit Courts interpretation is not implausible, but other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible.  It was not objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to conclude that the trial judges exercise of discretion was sound, both in light of what happened at trial and the fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one, to which there is no plainly correct or incorrect answer in this case.  Yarborough, supra, at 664.  The Sixth Circuit failed to grant the Michigan courts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and this Courts double jeopardy precedents.  Pp.911.


(d) The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on its own Fulton v. Moore decision for the proposition that Arizona v. Washington sets forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exercised sound discretion.  Because Fulton does not constitute clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, 2254(d)(1), failure to apply it does not independently authorize habeas relief under AEDPA.  Nor can Fulton be understood merely to illuminate this Courts decision in Washington, as Washington did not set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.  Pp.1112.


(e)  The Court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial.  Nonetheless, the steps that the Sixth Circuit thought she should have taken were not requiredeither under this Courts double jeopardy precedents or, by extension, under AEDPA.  Pp.12.

08-1529|"HUI etal. v. CASTANEDA, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF CASTANEDA, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081529.Argued March 2, 2010Decided May 3, 2010
While detained by immigration authorities, Francisco Castenada persistently sought treatment for a bleeding, suppurating lesion.  Although a U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) physicians assistant and three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda urgently needed a biopsy, petitionersa PHS physician and a commissioned PHS officerdenied the request.  After Castaneda was released from custody, tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer.  He then filed this suit, raising medical negligence claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.C. 1346, 26712680, and constitutional claims against petitioners under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397.  When Castaneda died, respondents, his representative and heir, were substituted as plaintiffs.  The District Court denied petitioners motion to dismiss the Bivens action, rejecting their claim of absolute immunity under 42 U. S.C. 233(a), which provides: The [FTCA] remedy against the United States provided by [28 U. S.C. 1346(b) and 2672] for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from the performance of medical  or related functions  by any [PHS] commissioned officer or employee  while acting within the scope of his office or employment, shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or employee.  (Emphasis added.)  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The immunity provided by 233(a) precludes Bivens actions against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of their office or employment.  Pp.513.
(a)The Courts inquiry begins and ends with 233(a)s text, which plainly precludes a Bivens action against petitioners by limiting recovery for harms arising from the conduct at issue to an FTCA action against the United States.  The breadth of 233(a)s words exclusive and any supports this reading, as does the provisions inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of the same subject-matter.  Because the phrase exclusive of any other civil action is easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown causes of action, the Courts reading is not undermined by the fact that 233(a) preceded Bivens.  The later enacted Westfall Act further supports this understanding of 233(a).  In amending the FTCA to make its remedy against the United States exclusive for most claims against Government employees for their official conduct, the Westfall Act essentially duplicated 233(a)s exclusivity language, 28 U. S.C.  2679(b)(1), but provided an explicit exception for constitutional violations, 2679(b)(2).  This shows that Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by 2679(b)(1)or the substantially similar 233(a)to imply such an exception.  Pp.57. 


(b)Respondents arguments to the contrary do not undermine the Courts conclusion.  Pp.712.  


(1)Respondents heavy reliance on Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, is misplaced.  Carlson is inapposite to the issue in this casewhether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violationsbecause the Carlson petitioners invoked no official immunity.  Instead, the case considered the separate question whether a remedy was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a federal remedy was also available under the FTCA.  Pp. 78.


(2)Contrary to respondents contention, 233(a) does not incorporate a Bivens exception through its cross-reference to 1346(b) and that sections cross-reference to the FTCA, which includes the Westfall Act exception for constitutional claims, 2679(b)(2)(A).  Because 233(a) refers only to [t]he remedy  provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 (emphasis added), only those portions of the FTCA that establish its remedy are incorporated by 233(a)s reference to 1346.  Section 2679(b) is not such a provision.  Pp.810.  


(3)Respondents claim that the Westfall Acts Bivens exception, 2679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens action against PHS officers and employees is belied by the fact that the provision by its terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in [p]aragraph (1).  Moreover, if 233(a) forecloses a Bivens action against PHS personnel, respondents reading of 2679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of the more specific 233(a).  Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legislative intent to repeal.  Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Nothing suggests that Congress intended 2679(b) to repeal 233(a)s more comprehensive immunity.  P.10.


(4)Respondents contention that other features of 233 show that 233(a) does not make the FTCA remedy exclusive of all other actions against PHS personnel is rejected.  Neither 233(c) nor 233(f) indicates that an injured party may maintain a Bivens action against an individual PHS officer or employee in these circumstances.  Pp.1012.

Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legislative intent to repeal.  Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Nothing suggests that Congress intended 2679(b) to repeal 233(a)s more comprehensive immunity.  P.10.


(4)Respondents contention that other features of 233 show that 233(a) does not make the FTCA remedy exclusive of all other actions against PHS personnel is rejected.  Neither 233(c) nor 233(f) indicates that an injured party may maintain a Bivens action against an individual PHS officer or employee in these circumstances.  Pp.1012.

08-472|"SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, etal. v. BUONO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 08472.Argued October 7, 2009Decided April 28, 2010
In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) to honor American soldiers who died in World War I.  Claiming to be offended by a religious symbols presence on federal land, respondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve, filed this suit alleging a violation of the First Amendments Establishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring the Government to remove the cross.  In the litigations first stage (Buono I), the District Court found that Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612613, it granted Buonos requested injunctive relief (2002 injunction).  The District Court did not consider whether the Governments actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused entanglement with religion.  While the Governments appeal was pending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, 8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in exchange for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve (land-transfer statute).  Affirming the District Courts judgment both as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address the statutes effect on Buonos suit or the statutes constitutionality (Buono II).  Because the Government did not seek review by this Court, the Court of Appeals judgment became final.  Buono then returned to the District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction.  In 2005, that court rejected the Governments claim that the transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead, that it was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on display.  The court granted Buonos motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute (Buono III).  The Ninth Circuit again affirmed, largely following the District Courts reasoning. 
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
502 F.3d 1069 and 527 F.3d 758, reversed and remanded.
Justice Kennedy, joined in full by The Chief Justice and in part by Justice Alito, concluded:


1.Buono has standing to maintain this action.  Whatever the validity of the Governments argument that Buonos asserted injuryoffense at a religious symbols presence on federal landis not personal to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argument is not available at this stage of the litigation.  The District Court rejected the argument in Buono I, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Buono II, and the Court of Appeals judgment became final and unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a certiorari petition, 28 U. S.C. 2101(c).  Moreover, Buono had standing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against the land-transfer statute.  A party that obtains a judgment in its favor acquires a judicially cognizable interest in ensuring compliance with that judgment.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737.  Buonos entitlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II, he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that injunction.  His interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing, given the rights he obtained under the earlier decree against the same party as to the same cross and the same land.  The Governments contention that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an argument about standing, but about the merits of the District Courts order.  Pp.79.


2.The District Court erred in enjoining the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect Buonos rights under the 2002 injunction.  Pp.918.


(a)A court may order an injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances bearing on the need for prospective relief.  See, e.g., United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114.  Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry.  The land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested relief.  By dismissing as illicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court took insufficient account of the context in which the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.  Placement of the cross on federal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the states imprimatur on a particular creed.  Rather, the intent was simply to honor fallen soldiers.  Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness.  The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma.  It could not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring.  Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress enacted the land-transfer statute.  The statute embodied a legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a framework and policy of accommodation.  The statute should not have been dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.  Pp.913.


(b)Where legislative action undermines the basis for previous relief, the relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the courts equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances render prospective relief inappropriate.  The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds.  Neither court considered whether the Government had acted based on an improper purpose.  Given this sole reliance on perception, any further relief grounded on the injunction should have rested on the same basis.  But the District Court used an injunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental endorsement) as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental purpose).  Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper.  The court failed to consider whether the change in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute had rendered the reasonable observer standard inappropriate to resolve the dispute.  Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono Is findings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.  Rather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, divorced from its background and context.  Pp.1317.


(c)The same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607, requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists.  Even if, contrary to the congressional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the statute.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329.  On remand, that court should conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for injunctive relief in light of the statute.  Pp.1718. 


Justice Alito concluded that this case should not be remanded for the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the land-transfer statute would violate the District Courts injunction or the Establishment Clause.  Rather, because the factual record has been sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he would decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented.  The cases singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem.  Its solution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that some would associate with the destruction of this historic monument.  The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the West, a land exchange, whereby ownership of the land on which the cross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby parcel of equal value.  The land transfer would not violate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain on federal land.  Nor would the statutes implementation constitute an endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  The so-called endorsement test views a challenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent facts relating to the display.  Here, therefore, this observer would be familiar with the monuments origin and history and thereby appreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution that best accommodates conflicting concerns.  Finally, the statute was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monuments religious message but to commemorate the Nations war dead and to avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the monuments destruction.  Pp.17.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that this Court need notindeed, cannotdecide this cases merits because Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which is not enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it.  By enjoining the Government from implementing the statute at issue, the District Courts 2005 order went well beyond the original injunctions proscription of the crosss display on public property.  Because Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will redress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or official violation of law.  Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  He has failed, however, to allege any such injury.  Even assuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on private property, that he will not be offended.  Neither district courts discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District Courts characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the existing injunction makes any difference.  If in fact a court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.  Pp.17.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 08905.Argued November 30, 2009Decided April 27, 2010
On November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud action under 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart-attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx.  A securities fraud complaint is timely if filed no more than 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or 5 years after the violation.  28 U. S.C. 1658(b).  The District Court dismissed the complaint as untimely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibility of Mercks misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to undertake a reasonably diligent investigation at that time.  Among the relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 VIGOR study comparing Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse cardiovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning letter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Mercks Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading; and (3) pleadings filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 alleging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and intentionally downplayed its risks.  The Third Circuit reversed, holding that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted with scienter, an element of a 10(b) violation, and consequently did not commence the running of the limitations period. 
Held: 
1.The limitations period in 1658(b)(1) begins to run once the plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discover[ed] the facts constituting the violationwhichever comes first.  In the statute of limitations context, discovery is often used as a term of art in connection with the discovery rule, a doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has discovered it.  The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures have sometimes codified this rule.  When discovery is written directly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.  Congress intended courts to interpret the word discovery in 1658(b)(1) similarly.  That statute was enacted after this Court determined a governing limitations period for private 10(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding that such actions must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation  , id., at 364 (emphasis added).  Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have held that discovery occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered them.  In 2002, Congress repeated Lampfs critical language in enacting the present limitations statute.  Normally, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.  See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116117, and n.13.  Given the history and precedent surrounding the use of discovery in the limitations context generally as well as in this provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly strong here.  Mercks claims are evaluated accordingly.  Pp.812.


2.In determining the time at which discovery occurs, terms such as inquiry notice and storm warnings may be useful insofar as they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating.  But the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the facts constituting the violation, including scienterirrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.  Pp.1217.


(a)Contrary to Mercks argument, facts showing scienter are among those that constitut[e] the violation.  Scienter is assuredly a fact.  In a 10(b) action, it refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n.12, and constitut[es] an important and necessary element of a 10(b) violation.  See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319.  Because the scienter element of 10(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(2), unless a 10(b) complaint sets out facts showing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with the relevant intent, the claim will fail.  It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in 1658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discover[ed] any facts suggesting scienter.  Pp.1214.


(b)The Court also rejects Mercks argument that, even if discovery requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter.  Where 10(b) is at issue, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.  For instance, an incorrect prediction about a firms future earnings, by itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliberately lied or made an innocent error.  Hence, discovery of additional scienter-related facts may be required.  The statutes inclusion of an unqualified bar on actions instituted 5 years after such violation, 1658(b)(2), should diminish Mercks fear that this requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago.  P. 14.


(c)And the Court cannot accept Mercks argument that the limitations period begins at inquiry notice, meaning the point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have discover[ed] facts showing scienter or other facts constituting the violation.  The statute says that the plaintiffs claim accrues only after the discovery of those latter facts.  It contains no indication that the limitations period can sometimes begin before discovery can take place.  Merck also argues that determining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discover[ed] the necessary facts is too complicated for judges to undertake.  But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this kind of inquiry in securities fraud cases.  Pp.1417.


3.Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, the facts constituting the violation.  The FDAs September 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent intent.  The FDA itself described the hypothesis as a possible explanation for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable alternative, that Vioxx might be harmful.  The products-liability complaints general statements about Mercks state of mind show little more.  Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-November 2001 circumstances reveal facts indicating the relevant scienter.  Pp.1719.

The Third Circuit reversed, holding that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted with scienter, an element of a 10(b) violation, and consequently did not commence the running of the limitations period. 
Held: 
1.The limitations period in 1658(b)(1) begins to run once the plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discover[ed] the facts constituting the violationwhichever comes first.  In the statute of limitations context, discovery is often used as a term of art in connection with the discovery rule, a doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has discovered it.  The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures have sometimes codified this rule.  When discovery is written directly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.  Congress intended courts to interpret the word discovery in 1658(b)(1) similarly.  That statute was enacted after this Court determined a governing limitations period for private 10(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding that such actions must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation  , id., at 364 (emphasis added).  Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have held that discovery occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered them.  In 2002, Congress repeated Lampfs critical language in enacting the present limitations statute.  Normally, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.  See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116117, and n.13.  Given the history and precedent surrounding the use of discovery in the limitations context generally as well as in this provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly strong here.  Mercks claims are evaluated accordingly.  Pp.812.


2.In determining the time at which discovery occurs, terms such as inquiry notice and storm warnings may be useful insofar as they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating.  But the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the facts constituting the violation, including scienterirrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.  Pp.1217.


(a)Contrary to Mercks argument, facts showing scienter are among those that constitut[e] the violation.  Scienter is assuredly a fact.  In a 10(b) action, it refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n.12, and constitut[es] an important and necessary element of a 10(b) violation.  See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319.  Because the scienter element of 10(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(2), unless a 10(b) complaint sets out facts showing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with the relevant intent, the claim will fail.  It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in 1658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discover[ed] any facts suggesting scienter.  Pp.1214.


(b)The Court also rejects Mercks argument that, even if discovery requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter.  Where 10(b) is at issue, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.  For instance, an incorrect prediction about a firms future earnings, by itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliberately lied or made an innocent error.  Hence, discovery of additional scienter-related facts may be required.  The statutes inclusion of an unqualified bar on actions instituted 5 years after such violation, 1658(b)(2), should diminish Mercks fear that this requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago.  P. 14.


(c)And the Court cannot accept Mercks argument that the limitations period begins at inquiry notice, meaning the point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have discover[ed] facts showing scienter or other facts constituting the violation.  The statute says that the plaintiffs claim accrues only after the discovery of those latter facts.  It contains no indication that the limitations period can sometimes begin before discovery can take place.  Merck also argues that determining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discover[ed] the necessary facts is too complicated for judges to undertake.  But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this kind of inquiry in securities fraud cases.  Pp.1417.


3.Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, the facts constituting the violation.  The FDAs September 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent intent.  The FDA itself described the hypothesis as a possible explanation for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable alternative, that Vioxx might be harmful.  The products-liability complaints general statements about Mercks state of mind show little more.  Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-November 2001 circumstances reveal facts indicating the relevant scienter.  Pp.1719.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 081198.Argued December 9, 2009Decided April 27, 2010
Petitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for parcel tankersseagoing vessels with compartments that are separately chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish to ship liquids in small quantities.  AnimalFeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.  The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbitration clause.  AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling that the charterers claims were not subject to arbitration.  As a consequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.  AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services.  The parties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agreement allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S. 444.  One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to determine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration.  The parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was silent on the class arbitration issue.  The panel determined that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court vacated the award.  It concluded that the arbitrators award was made in manifest disregard of the law, for had the arbitrators conducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of custom and usage.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that because petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators decision was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitrators had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not established a rule against class arbitration. 
Held:Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to authorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.C. 1 et seq.  Pp.723.
(a)The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law.  Pp.712. 


(1)An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA 10(a)(4) on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, only when [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense[s] his own brand of industrial justice, Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S. 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrators task is to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.  P. 7.


(2)The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on AnimalFeeds public policy argument for permitting class arbitration under the charter partys arbitration clause.  However, because the parties agreed that their agreement was silent on the class arbitration issue, the arbitrators proper task was to identify the rule of law governing in that situation.  Instead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.  Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a default rule permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitration absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a common-law courts authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule for such a situation.  Finding no reason to depart from its perception of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration.  The panels few references to intent do not show that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference.  Thus, under FAA 10(b), this Court must either direct a rehearing by the arbitrators or decide the question originally referred to the panel.  Because there can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.  Pp.712.


(b)Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the instant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this class.  Pp.1217.


(1)No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which concerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers that had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class arbitration.  The plurality decided only the question whether the court or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were silent on the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.  Justice Stevens opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on his resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate decisionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.  Pp.1215.


(2)The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at their arbitration proceeding.  For one thing, the parties appear to have believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question addressed only by the plurality.  That question need not be revisited here because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.  Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have misunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration is permitted.  However, Bazzle left that question open.  Pp.1517. 


(c)Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.  Pp.1723.


(1)The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including the basic precept that arbitration is a matter of consent, not coercion.  Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479.  The FAA requires that a written provision in any maritime transaction calling for the arbitration of a controversy arising out of such transaction shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract, 9 U. S.C. 2, and permits a party to an arbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order directing that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement, 4.  Thus, this Court has said that the FAAs central purpose is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.  Whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause, courts and arbitrators must give effect to the [parties] contractual rights and expectations.  Ibid.  The  parties intentions control, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626, and the parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit, Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57.  They may agree to limit the issues arbitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will proceed.  They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes.  See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.  Pp.1720.


(2)It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.  Here, the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration despite the parties stipulation that they had reached no agreement on that issue.  The panels conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.  It may be appropriate to presume that parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitrator to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties agreement.  See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 84.  But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an agreement to arbitrate.  The differences between simple bilateral and complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.  Pp.2023.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 081200.Argued January 13, 2010Decided April 21, 2010
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U. S.C. 1692 et seq., imposes civil liability on debt collector[s] for certain prohibited debt collection practices.  A debt collector who fails to comply with any [FDCPA] provision  with respect to any person is liable to such person for actual damage[s], costs, a reasonable attorneys fee as determined by the court, and statutory additional damages.  1692k(a).  In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 41 et seq., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  See 1692l.  A debt collector who acts with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA] is subject to civil penalties enforced by the FTC.  45(m)(1)(A), (C).  A debt collector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however, if it shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.  1692k(c).


Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Carlisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage company to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner Jerman.  The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.  Jermans lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mortgage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Carlisle withdrew the suit.  Jerman then filed this action, contending that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writing, Carlisle had violated 1692g(a) of the FDCPA, which governs the contents of notices to debtors.  The District Court, acknowledging a division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated 1692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under 1692k(c)s bona fide error defense.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the defense in 1692k(c) is not limited to clerical or factual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.
Held:The bona fide error defense in 1692k(c) does not apply to a violation resulting from a debt collectors mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA.  Pp.630.
(a)A violation resulting from a debt collectors misinterpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be not intentional under 1692k(c).  It is a common maxim that ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.  Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411.  When Congress has intended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more explicitly than here.  In particular, the administrative-penalty provisions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that the FDCPA prohibited its action.  45(m)(1)(A), (C).  Given the absence of similar language in 1692k(c), it is fair to infer that Congress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for intentional conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited.  Congress also did not confine FDCPA liability to willful violations, a term more often understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law.  See, e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125126.  Section 1692k(c)s requirement that a debt collector maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error also more naturally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual errors.  Pp.612.


(b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statutes context and history.  The FDCPAs separate protection from liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC] advisory opinion,  1692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPAs prohibitions are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense.  Moreover, in enacting the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 1640(c).  At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILAs language into the FDCPA.  Although in 1980 Congress amended the defense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial interpretation of that provision.  It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPAs defense to be broader than TILAs, and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.  Carlisles reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA would fall under that provision.  Pp.1322.


(c)Todays decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt-collecting lawyers.  The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in calculating additional damages and attorneys fees.  Lawyers have recourse to the bona fide error defense in 1692k(c) when a violation results from a qualifying factual error.  To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a lawyers advocacy on behalf of a client, it is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.  Numerous state consumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.  To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that the result [will be] so absurd as to warrant disregarding the weight of textual authority.  Heintz, supra, at 295.  Absent such a showing, arguments that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.  Pp.2230.

A debt collector who acts with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA] is subject to civil penalties enforced by the FTC.  45(m)(1)(A), (C).  A debt collector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however, if it shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.  1692k(c).


Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Carlisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage company to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner Jerman.  The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.  Jermans lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mortgage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Carlisle withdrew the suit.  Jerman then filed this action, contending that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writing, Carlisle had violated 1692g(a) of the FDCPA, which governs the contents of notices to debtors.  The District Court, acknowledging a division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated 1692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under 1692k(c)s bona fide error defense.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the defense in 1692k(c) is not limited to clerical or factual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.
Held:The bona fide error defense in 1692k(c) does not apply to a violation resulting from a debt collectors mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA.  Pp.630.
(a)A violation resulting from a debt collectors misinterpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be not intentional under 1692k(c).  It is a common maxim that ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.  Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411.  When Congress has intended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more explicitly than here.  In particular, the administrative-penalty provisions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that the FDCPA prohibited its action.  45(m)(1)(A), (C).  Given the absence of similar language in 1692k(c), it is fair to infer that Congress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for intentional conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited.  Congress also did not confine FDCPA liability to willful violations, a term more often understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law.  See, e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125126.  Section 1692k(c)s requirement that a debt collector maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error also more naturally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual errors.  Pp.612.


(b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statutes context and history.  The FDCPAs separate protection from liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC] advisory opinion,  1692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPAs prohibitions are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense.  Moreover, in enacting the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 1640(c).  At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILAs language into the FDCPA.  Although in 1980 Congress amended the defense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial interpretation of that provision.  It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPAs defense to be broader than TILAs, and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.  Carlisles reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA would fall under that provision.  Pp.1322.


(c)Todays decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt-collecting lawyers.  The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in calculating additional damages and attorneys fees.  Lawyers have recourse to the bona fide error defense in 1692k(c) when a violation results from a qualifying factual error.  To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a lawyers advocacy on behalf of a client, it is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.  Numerous state consumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.  To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that the result [will be] so absurd as to warrant disregarding the weight of textual authority.  Heintz, supra, at 295.  Absent such a showing, arguments that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.  Pp.2230.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 08970.Argued October 14, 2009Decided April 21, 2010
Title 42 U. S.C. 1988 authorizes courts to award a reasonable attorneys fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions.  Half of respondents $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours the attorneys and their employees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the community.  The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience to litigate this case.  Awarding fees of about $10.5million, the District Court found that the proposed hourly rates were fair and reasonable, but that some of the entries on counsels billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were excessive.  The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 million, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.  
Held: 
1.The calculation of an attorneys fee based on the lodestar may be increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary circumstances.  Pp.  512.


(a)The lodestar approach has achieved dominance in the federal courts.  Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 801.  Although imperfect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that approximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case; and it is readily administrable, see, e.g., Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 566, and objective, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433, thereby cabining trial judges discretion, permitting meaningful judicial review, and producing reasonably predictable results.  Pp.  57. 


(b)This Court has established six important rules that lead to todays decision.  First, a reasonable fee is one that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case, see Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565, but that does not provide a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys, ibid.  Second, there is a strong presumption that the lodestar method yields a sufficient fee.  See, e.g., id., at 564.  Third, the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may be awarded in rare and exceptional circumstances.  E.g., id., at 565.  Fourth, the lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a reasonable attorneys fee.  Id., at 566.  An enhancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation, such as the cases novelty and complexity, see, e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898, or the quality of an attorneys performance, Delaware Valley, supra, at 566.  Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant.  E.g., Blum, 465  U. S., at 901.  Sixth, an applicant seeking an enhancement must produce specific evidence supporting the award, id., at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.  Pp. 79. 


(c)The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation.  The strong presumption that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.  P. 9. 


(d)The Court treats the quality of an attorneys performance and the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior attorney performance and not another factor, such as inferior performance by opposing counsel.  The circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation are rare and exceptional.  Enhancements should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been adequate to attract competent counsel.  Blum, supra, at 897.  First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately measure the attorneys true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation.  This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar) or perhaps only a few similar factors.  In such a case, the trial judge should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorneys ability to a prevailing market rate.  Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorneys performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted.  In such cases, the enhancement amount must be calculated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest rate to the qualifying expense outlays.  Third, an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorneys performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.  In such a case, the enhancement should be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional delay in expense reimbursement.  Enhancements are not appropriate on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common.  Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increasingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with a bonus for obtaining specified results.  Pp. 912.


2.The District Court did not provide proper justification for the 75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case.  It commented that the enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropriate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.  The court also emphasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount of the enhancement attributable to this factor.  Similarly, the court noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on 1988 for fees.  Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay.  And its reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes Dague, supra, at 565.  Finally, insofar as the court relied on a comparison of counsels performance in this case with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review.  While determining a reasonable attorneys fee is within the trial judges sound discretion under 1988, that discretion is not unlimited.  The judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, including any enhancement.  Pp.1215. 
532 F.3d 1209, reversed and remanded.

No. 08810.Argued January 20, 2010Decided April 21, 2010
Petitioners are Xerox Corporations pension plan (Plan) and the Plans current and former administrators (Plan Administrator).  Respondents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were later rehired.  To account for the past distributions when calculating respondents current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as the phantom account method.  Respondents challenged that method in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded.  It held that the Plan Administrators interpretation was unreasonable and that respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom account method would be used to calculate their benefits.  On remand, the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had previously received.  The District Court declined to apply a deferential standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of money.  Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on remand, and that the District Courts decision on the merits was not an abuse of discretion.  
Held:The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of review to the Plan Administrators interpretation of the Plan on remand.  Pp.415.
(a)This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101.  Firestone looked to principles of trust law for guidance.  Id., at 111.  Under trust law, the appropriate standard depends on the language of the instrument creating the trust.  When a trust instrument gives the trustee power to construe disputed or doubtful terms,  the trustees interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.  Ibid.  Under Firestone and the Plans terms, the Plan Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when interpreting the Plan.  The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an exception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a deferential standard when a plan administrators previous construction of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA.  Pp.45.  


(b)The Second Circuits one-strike-and-youre-out approach has no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference with no suggestion that it was susceptible to adhoc exceptions.  This Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___, that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of interest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review.  In light of that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should require a different result.  Nor is the Second Circuits decision supported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were basedthe plans terms, trust law principles, and ERISAs purposes.  The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive authority without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to construe the Plan.  An exception to Firestone deference is also not required by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA but do not tell the entire story.  Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497.  Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good-faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.


ERISA represents a careful balancing between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.  Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215.  Firestone deference preserves this careful balancing and protects the statutes interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity.  Respondents claim that deference is less important once a plan administrators interpretation has been found unreasonable, but the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not suddenly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illustrated by this case.  When the District Court declined to apply a deferential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more complicated than necessary.  Respondents approach threatens to interject additional issues into ERISA litigation that would create further complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may already be too costly for many [seeking] redress.  Glenn, supra, at ___.  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniformity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone deference.  The District Courts interpretation does not account for the time value of money, but respondents own actuarial expert testified that fairness required recognizing that principle.  Respondents do not dispute that the District Courts approach would place them in a better position than employees who never left the company.  If other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations in different States.  Pp.513.


(c)Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unreasonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit disputes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from challenging administrators decisions.  These concerns are overblown because there is no reason to think that deference would be required in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee.  Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of costly litigation that respondents fear.  Applying a deferential standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator will always prevail on the merits.  It means only that the plan administrators interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.  Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111.  The lower courts should have applied the standard established in Firestone and Glenn.  Pp.1314.
535 F.3d 111, reversed and remanded.

(c)Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unreasonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit disputes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from challenging administrators decisions.  These concerns are overblown because there is no reason to think that deference would be required in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee.  Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of costly litigation that respondents fear.  Applying a deferential standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator will always prevail on the merits.  It means only that the plan administrators interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.  Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111.  The lower courts should have applied the standard established in Firestone and Glenn.  Pp.1314.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 081008.Argued November 2, 2009Decided March 31, 2010
After respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New York law on petitioner Shady Groves insurance claim, Shady Grove filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it and others.  Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of jurisdiction by N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. 901(b), which precludes a class action to recover a penalty such as statutory interest.  Affirming, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.C. 2072, would control if it conflicted with 901(b), but held there was no conflict because 901(b) and Rule 23 address different issueseligibility of the particular type of claim for class treatment and certifiability of a given class, respectively.  Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court of Appeals held that 901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting in diversity because it is substantive within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
549 F.3d 137, reversed and remanded. 
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and IIA, concluding that 901(b) does not preclude a federal district court sitting in diversity from entertaining a class action under Rule 23.  Pp.312.


(a)If Rule 23 answers the question in dispute, it governs here unless it exceeds its statutory authorization or Congresss rulemaking power.  Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 45.  Pp.34.


(b)Rule 23(b) answers the question in disputewhether Shady Groves suit may proceed as a class actionwhen it states that [a] class action may be maintained if certain conditions are met.  Since 901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady Groves suit may not be maintained as a class action because of the relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires.  The Second Circuits view that 901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues is rejected.  The line between eligibility and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23 explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case meeting its criteria.  Allstates arguments based on the exclusion of some federal claims from Rule 23s reach pursuant to federal statutes and on 901s structure are unpersuasive.  Pp.46.


(c)The dissents claim that 901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 because it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is foreclosed by 901(b)s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.  The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S.C. 2072(b), does not apply because Rule 23 is clear.  The dissents approach does not avoid a conflict between 901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would render Rule 23 partially invalid.  Pp.612. 


Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded in Parts IIB and IID:


(a)The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.C. 2072, not Erie, controls the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure.  Section 2072(b)s requirement that federal procedural rules not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right means that a Rule must really regulat[e] procedure,the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them, Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14.  Though a Rule may incidentally affect a partys rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies, or the rules of decision for adjudicating either.  Rule 23 satisfies that criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their separate claims against the same defendants.  Allstates arguments asserting 901(b)s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that matters, but that of the Federal Rule.  See, e.g., id., at 14.  Pp.1216.


(b)Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable result of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress created.  P.22.


Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IIC that the concurrences analysisunder which a Federal Rule may displace a state procedural rule that is not bound up or sufficiently intertwined with substantive rights and remedies under state lawsquarely conflicts with Sibbachs single criterion that the Federal Rule really regulat[e] procedure, 312 U. S., at 1314.  Pp.1622.


Justice Stevens agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case.  Pp.122.  


(a)When the application of a federal rule would abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right, 28 U. S.C. 2072(b), the federal rule cannot govern.  In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied, displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right.  Examples may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of recovery.  An application of a federal rule that directly collides with such a state law violates the Rules Enabling Act.  Pp.113.  


(b)N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. 901(b), however, is not such a state law.  It is a procedural rule that is not part of New Yorks substantive law. Pp.1722.

08-769|"UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 08769.Argued October 6, 2009Decided April 20, 2010
Congress enacted 18 U. S.C. 48 to criminalize the commercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.  The statute addresses only portrayals of harmful acts, not the underlying conduct.  It applies to any visual or auditory depiction in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed, if that conduct violates federal or state law where the creation, sale, or possession takes place, 48(c)(1).  Another clause exempts depictions with serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.  48(b).  The legislative background of 48 focused primarily on crush videos, which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish.  Respondent Stevens was indicted under 48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.  He moved to dismiss, arguing that 48 is facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The District Court denied his motion, and Stevens was convicted.  The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and declared 48 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of protected speech.
Held:Section 48 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp.520.
(a)Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.  Because 48 explicitly regulates expression based on content, it is presumptively invalid,  and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.  United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 817.  Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions on a few historic categories of speechincluding obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal conductthat have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572.  Depictions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list.  While the prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law, there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting depictions of such cruelty.  The Governments proposed test would broadly balance the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine whether the First Amendment even applies.  But the First Amendments free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an adhoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.  The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.  New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, distinguished.  Pp.59.


(b)Stevenss facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.  Pp.920.


(1)In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n.6.  Stevens claims that common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of materials subject to 48.  The Government does not defend such applications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to specific types of extreme material.  Section 48s constitutionality thus turns on how broadly it is construed.  Pp.910.


(2)Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.  The statutes definition of a depiction of animal cruelty does not even require that the depicted conduct be cruel.  While the words maimed, mutilated, [and] tortured convey cruelty, wounded and killed do not.  Those words have little ambiguity and should be read according to their ordinary meaning.  Section 48 does require that the depicted conduct be illegal, but many federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.  For example, endangered species protections restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals.  The statute draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.


Moreover, 48 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, regardless of whether the  wounding  or killing took place there, 48(c)(1).  Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the same conduct is unlawful.  This greatly expands 48s scope, because views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.  Hunting is unlawful in the District of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions.  Because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country, 48(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that is sold in the Nations Capital.  Those seeking to comply with the law face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate jurisdictions.  Pp.1115.


(3)Limiting 48s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal fighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the statutes exceptions clause.  The statute only exempts material with serious value, and serious must be taken seriously.  The excepted speech must also fall within one of 48(b)s enumerated categories.  Much speech does not.  For example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional in nature.  The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading that results in the statutes banning only the depictions the Government would like to ban.


Although the language of 48(b) is drawn from the Courts decision in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the exceptions clause does not answer every First Amendment objection.  Under Miller, serious value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity.  But Miller did not determine that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.  Even wholly neutral futilities  come under the protection of free speech.  Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25.  The First Amendment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify for 48(b)s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall within 48(c)s broad reach.  Pp.1517.


(4)Despite the Governments assurance that it will apply 48 to reach only extreme cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it responsibly.  Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to avoid constitutional doubt.  A limiting construction can be imposed only if the statute is readily susceptible to such a construction, Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 884.  To read 48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinterpretation.  Pp.1819.  


(5)This construction of 48 decides the constitutional question.  The Government makes no effort to defend 48 as applied beyond crush videos and depictions of animal fighting.  It argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny.  But the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depictions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to 48.  Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively impermissible applications of 48 far outnumber any permissible ones.  The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.  Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp.1920.  
533 F.3d 218, affirmed.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 081402.Argued January 20, 2010Decided March 30, 2010
Criminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.  See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522.  To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group qualifying as distinctive (2) is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury venires, and (3) systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.  Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.


At voir dire in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.  At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the Countys jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.  The court rejected Smiths objection to the panels racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole.


On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Smiths fair-cross-section claim.  The evidence at the hearing showed, inter alia, that under the juror-assignment order in effect when Smiths jury was empaneled, the County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and, only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smiths.  Smith calls this procedure siphoning.  The month after Smiths voir dire, however, the County reversed course and adopted a Circuit-Court-first assignment order.  It did so based on the belief that the district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County.  The trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  First, the court described the absolute disparity test, under which the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the percentage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population (7.28%).  According to this measure, African-Americans were underrepresented by 1.28%.  Next, the court set out the comparative disparity test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population (7.28%).  The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, African-Americans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on the jury-service list.  In the 11 months after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to 15.1%.  The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires.  But Smiths evidence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror-assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had systematically excluded African-Americans.  The court therefore rejected Smiths fair-cross-section claim.


The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment order.  Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment violation.  This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.  The court noted that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test.  Adopting a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measurement.  Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation, the court determined that he had not shown systematic exclusion.


Smith then filed a federal habeas petition.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal habeas relief unless the state courts adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(d)(2).  Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Courts decision when assessed under AEDPAs standards, the District Court dismissed Smiths petition.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly excluded group is small.  The court then held that Smiths comparative disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans representation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.  It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion.  In accord with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit believed that the district-court-first assignment order significantly reduced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court venires.  Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, because no important state interest supported the district-court-first allocation system.
Held:The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme Courts decision involv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, 2254(d)(1).  Duren hardly establishesno less clearly sothat Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.  Pp. 1016.
(a)The Duren defendant readily met all three parts of the Courts prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a countys jury pool.  First, he showed that women in the county were both numerous and distinct from men.  439 U. S., at 364.  Second, to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn.  Id., at 364366.  Finally, to show the systematic cause of the underrepresentation, he pointed to Missouris law permitting any woman to opt out of jury service and to the manner in which the county administered that law.  This Court noted that appropriately tailored hardship exemptions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by an important state interest, id., at 370, but concluded that no such interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, id., at 369370.  Pp. 1011.


(b)Neither Duren nor any other decision of this Court specifies the method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.  Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts belowabsolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard deviationis imperfect.  Absolute disparity and comparative disparity measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the distinctive group compose only a small percentage of the communitys jury-eligible population.  And it appears that no court has relied exclusively on a standard deviation analysis.  Even absent AEDPAs constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.  Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smiths statistical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court nevertheless gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the extent underrepresentation existed, was it due to systematic exclusion?  See Duren, 439 U. S., at 364.  Pp. 1113. 


(c)Smiths evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  Although the record established that some County officials believed that the assignment order created racial disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief was not substantiated by Smiths evidence.  He introduced no evidence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit Courts venires in significantly higher percentages than on the District Court for Grand Rapids, which had the Countys largest African-American population.  He did not address whether Grand Rapids had more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent County.  And he did not compare the African-American representation levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District Court venires for the same region.  See Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n.25.  Smiths best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent County reversed its assignment order.  But that evidence indicated no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  Pp. 1314. 


(d)In addition to renewing his siphoning argument, Smith urges that a laundry list of factorse.g., the Countys practice of excusing prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appearcombined to reduce systematically the number of African-Americans appearing on jury lists.  No clearly established precedent of this Court supports Smiths claim.  Smith urges that one sentence in Duren, 439 U. S., at 368369, places the burden of proving causation on the State.  But Smith clipped that sentence from its context: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show to rebut the defendants prima facie case.  The Michigan Supreme Court was therefore far from unreasonable, 2254(d)(1), in concluding that Duren first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrepresentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion.  This Court, furthermore, has never clearly established that jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smiths list can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim.  Rather, the Taylor Court recognized broad discretion in the States to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.  419 U. S., at 537538.  And in Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions resembling those Smith assails might well survive a fair-cross-section challenge.  439 U. S., at 370.  Pp. 1416.

			"|"BERGHUIS, WARDEN v. SMITH
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 081402.Argued January 20, 2010Decided March 30, 2010
Criminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.  See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522.  To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group qualifying as distinctive (2) is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury venires, and (3) systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.  Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.

08-586|"JONES etal. v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L.P.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08586.Argued November 2, 2009Decided March 30, 2010
Petitioners, shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent investment adviser, filed this suit alleging that respondent violated 36(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes a fiduciary duty [on investment advisers] with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, 15 U. S.C. 80a35(b).  Granting respondent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petitioners had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable standard set forth in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F.2d 923, 928 (CA2): [T]he test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arms-length in light of all of the surrounding circumstances. To be guilty of a violation of 36(b),  the adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arms length bargaining.  Rejecting the Gartenberg standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different reasoning.  
Held:Based on 36(b)s terms and the role that a shareholder action for breach of the investment advisers fiduciary duty plays in the Acts overall structure, Gartenberg applied the correct standard.  Pp.717.
(a)A consensus has developed regarding the standard Gartenberg set forth over 25 years ago: The standard has been adopted by other federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commissions regulations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors. Both petitioners and respondents generally endorse the Gartenberg approach but disagree in some respects about its meaning.  Pp.79. 


(b)Section 36(b)s fiduciary duty phrase finds its meaning in Pepper v. Linton, 308 U. S. 295, 306307, where the Court discussed the concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arms length bargain.  If it does not, equity will set it aside.  Gartenbergs approach fully incorporates this understanding, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into account and using the range of fees that might result from arms-length bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees.  Pp.911. 


(c)Gartenbergs approach also reflects 36(b)s place in the statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protections the Act affords investors.  Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 482, and shareholder suits under 36(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling adviser conflicts of interest, see Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 541.  In recognition of the disinterested directors role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an advisers compensation such consideration  as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.  80a35(b)(1).  It may be inferred from this formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a boards judgment may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate measure of deference varies depending on the circumstances.  Gartenberg heeds these precepts.  See 694 F.2d, at 930.  Pp.1112. 


(d)The Court resolves the parties disagreements on several important questions.  First, since the Act requires consideration of all relevant factors, 80a35(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in light of the similarities and differences between the services the clients in question require.  In doing so, the Court must be wary of inapt comparisons based on significant differences between those services and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between the two types of clients.  However, courts should not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds by other advisers, which may not result from arms-length negotiations.  Finally, a courts evaluation of an investment advisers fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.  Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors, their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differently. Cf. Lasker, 441 U. S., at 486.  In contrast, where the boards process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome.  Id., at 484.  Gartenbergs so disproportionately large standard, 694 F.2d, at 928, reflects Congress choice to rely largely upon [independent] watchdogs to protect shareholders interests, Lasker, supra, at 482.  Pp.1216. 


(e)The Seventh Circuit erred in focusing on disclosure by investment advisers rather than the Gartenberg standard, which the panel rejected.  That standard may lack sharp analytical clarity, but it accurately reflects the compromise embodied in 36(b) as to the appropriate method of testing investment adviser compensation, and it has provided a workable standard for nearly three decades.  Pp.1617.

08-651|"PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky
No. 08651.Argued October 13, 2009Decided March 31, 2010
Petitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug-distribution charges in Kentucky.  In postconviction proceedings, he claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry about deportation since he had lived in this country so long.  He alleges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incorrect advice.  The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconviction relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendments effective-assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from erroneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a collateral consequence of a conviction.  
Held:Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.  Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed here.  Pp.218.
(a)Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizens criminal conviction.  While once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges authority to alleviate deportations harsh consequences.  Because the drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.  Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.  Pp.26.


(b)Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, applies to Padillas claim.  Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel.  McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padillas ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters.  However, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collateral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally reasonable professional assistance required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689.  The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deportation.  Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is intimately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.  Because that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Pp.79.


(c)To satisfy Stricklands two-prong inquiry, counsels representation must fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, 466 U. S., at 688, and there must be a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different, id., at 694.  The first, constitutional deficiency, is necessarily linked to the legal communitys practice and expectations.  Id., at 688.  The weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the deportation risk.  And this Court has recognized the importance to the client of [p]reserving the  right to remain in the United States and preserving the possibility of discretionary relief from deportation.  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 323.  Thus, this is not a hard case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padillas plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsels advice was incorrect.  There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear.  In those cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse immigration consequences.  But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.  Accepting Padillas allegations as true, he has sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy Stricklands first prong.  Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.  Pp.912.


(d)The Solicitor Generals proposed rulethat Strickland should be applied to Padillas claim only to the extent that he has alleged affirmative misadviceis unpersuasive.  And though this Court must be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas, the 25 years since Strickland was first applied to ineffective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions after a trial.  Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.  This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions obtained through plea bargains.  Cf. Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58.  Pp.1216.

			"|"PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky
No. 08651.Argued October 13, 2009Decided March 31, 2010
Petitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug-distribution charges in Kentucky.  In postconviction proceedings, he claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry about deportation since he had lived in this country so long.  He alleges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incorrect advice.  The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconviction relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendments effective-assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from erroneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a collateral consequence of a conviction.  
Held:Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.  Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed here.  Pp.218.

08-304|"GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT etal. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 08304.Argued November 30, 2009Decided March 30, 2010
The False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in, inter alia, a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.  31 U. S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).  Here, federal contracts provided that two North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body involved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible fraud.  Both the county and the State issued reports identifying potential irregularities in the contracts administration.  Subsequently, Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that petitioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials, knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held were administrative reports under the FCAs public disclosure bar.  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal administrative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.  
Held:The reference to administrative reports, audits, and investigations in 3730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources.  Pp.421.
(a)Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits.  The language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).  Pp. 45.


(b)The FCAs plain text does not limit administrative to federal sources.  Because that term modifies report, hearing, audit, or investigation in a provision about the public disclosure of fraud on the United States, it is most naturally read to describe government agency activities.  But since administrative is not itself modified by federal, there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state and local agency activities from its ambit.  The interpretive maxim noscitur a sociisa word may be known by the company it keeps, Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519does not support the Fourth Circuits more limited view.  In Category 2, administrative is sandwiched between the federal terms congressional and [GAO], but these items are too few and too disparate to qualify as a string of statutory terms, S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or items in a list, Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a sociis purposes.  Furthermore, evaluating administrative within the public disclosure bars larger scheme, the Court observes that Category 2s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Category 1 (criminal, civil, or administrative hearing) and Category 3 (news media) that are generally understood to include nonfederal sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (administrative) that is at issue.  Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi-legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legislative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.  The FCAs overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.  And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in 3730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.  Pp.512.


(c)The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal interpretation of administrative.  The current 3730(e)(4)(A) was enacted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.  How exactly the statute came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant substantive changesincluding the introduction of administrative in Category 2were inserted without floor debate or other discussion, as technical amendments.  Though Congress wanted to strengthen the Governments hand in fighting false claims, Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119, 133134, and encourage more qui tam suits, it also determined to bar a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful.  The question here concerns that subsets precise scope; and on that matter, the record is all but opaque, leaving no evident legislative purpose to guide resolution of this discrete issue, United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 310.  Pp.1218.

08-1134|"UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081134.Argued December 1, 2009Decided March 23, 2010
A plan proposed under Bankruptcy Code (Code) Chapter 13 becomes effective upon confirmation, see 11 U. S.C. 1324, 1325, and will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see 1328(a).  A debtor may obtain a discharge of government-sponsored student loan debts only if failure to discharge that debt would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and his dependents.  523(a)(8); 1328.  Bankruptcy courts must make this undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001(6), which the party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.  Respondent Espinosas plan proposed repaying the principal on his student loan debt and discharging the interest once the principal was repaid, but he did not initiate the required adversary proceeding.  The student loan creditor, petitioner United, received notice of the plan from the Bankruptcy Court and did not object to the plan or to Espinosas failure to initiate the required proceeding.  The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan without holding such a proceeding or making a finding of undue hardship.  Once Espinosa paid his student loan principal, the court discharged the interest.  A few years later, the Department of Education sought to collect that interest.  In response, Espinosa asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the Department and United to cease any collection efforts.  United opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation order because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosas student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bankruptcy Rules, and because Uniteds due process rights were violated when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and complaint.  Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court granted Espinosas motion in relevant part and denied the cross-motion.  The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied due process when the confirmation order was issued without the required service.  The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed.  It concluded that by confirming Espinosas plan without first finding undue hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most committed a legal error that United might have successfully appealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as void under Rule 60(b)(4).  It also held that Espinosas failure to serve United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void because United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.  
Held: 
1.The Bankruptcy Courts confirmation order is not void under Rule 60(b)(4).  Pp.614.


(a)That order was a final judgment from which United did not appeal.  Such finality ordinarily would stan[d] in the way of challenging [the orders] enforceability, Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___.  However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment that is void, but only in the rare instance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be heard.  Uniteds alleged error falls in neither category.  Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of Espinosas proposed discharge.  Espinosas failure to serve the summons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived United of a right granted by a procedural rule.  United could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection.  But this deprivation did not amount to a violation of due process, which requires notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections, Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314.  Here, Uniteds actual notice of the filing and contents of Espinosas plan more than satisfied its due process rights.  Thus, Espinosas failure to make the required service does not entitle United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).  Pp.710.


(b)Contrary to Uniteds claim, the confirmation order is not void because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm Espinosas plan absent an undue hardship finding under 523(a)(8).  Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief.  Section 523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over student loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a denial of due process.  Instead, it requires a court to make a certain findings before confirming a student loan debts discharge.  That this requirement is self-executing, Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy courts failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.  Although the Bankruptcy Courts failure to find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is enforceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.  Pp.1014.


2.The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.  A Chapter 13 plan proposing such a discharge without the required determination violates 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).  Failure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the applicable provisions of the Code.  1325(a).  Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.  Pp.1416.


3.Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an appropriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from filing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the proposal and the creditor will not object.  Such bad-faith efforts should be deterred by the specter of penalties that [d]ebtors and their attorneys face  under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings, Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644.  And Congress may enact additional provisions to address any difficulties should existing sanctions prove inadequate.  Pp.1617.
553 F.3d 1193, affirmed.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314.  Here, Uniteds actual notice of the filing and contents of Espinosas plan more than satisfied its due process rights.  Thus, Espinosas failure to make the required service does not entitle United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).  Pp.710.


(b)Contrary to Uniteds claim, the confirmation order is not void because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm Espinosas plan absent an undue hardship finding under 523(a)(8).  Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief.  Section 523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over student loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a denial of due process.  Instead, it requires a court to make a certain findings before confirming a student loan debts discharge.  That this requirement is self-executing, Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy courts failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.  Although the Bankruptcy Courts failure to find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is enforceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.  Pp.1014.


2.The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.  A Chapter 13 plan proposing such a discharge without the required determination violates 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).  Failure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the applicable provisions of the Code.  1325(a).  Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.  Pp.1416.


3.Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an appropriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from filing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the proposal and the creditor will not object.  Such bad-faith efforts should be deterred by the specter of penalties that [d]ebtors and their attorneys face  under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings, Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644.  And Congress may enact additional provisions to address any difficulties should existing sanctions prove inadequate.  Pp.1617.

08-728|"BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 08728.Argued October 6, 2009Decided March 8, 2010
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendants trial to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance, 18 U. S.C. 3161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met, 3162(a)(2).  As relevant here, the Act automatically excludes from the 70-day period delay resulting from  proceedings concerning the defendant, 18 U. S.C.A. 3161(h)(1) (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court to exclude delay resulting from a continuance it grants, provided the court makes findings required by 3161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).  Petitioners indictment on federal firearm and drug possession charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006.  After petitioners arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to file pretrial motions by September 13.  On September 7, the court granted petitioners motion to extend that deadline, but on the new due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial motions.  On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver voluntary and intelligent.  Over the next three months, petitioners trial was delayed several times, often at petitioners instigation.  On February 19, 2007179 days after he was indictedhe moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the Acts 70-day limit had elapsed.  In denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from September 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time.  At trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to concurrent prison terms.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7 through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1).
Held:The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1).  Such time may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).  Pp.618.
(a)The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders automatically excludable delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.  This provision communicates Congress judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is automatically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pretrial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continuance under subsection (h)(7).  This limitation is significant because Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)s enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired.  Although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically excludable.  Pp.710.


(b)This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry because [a] specific provision (here, subparagraph (D)) controls one[s] of more general application (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).  Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407.  A contrary result would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of this Courts approach.  Subsection (h)(1)s phrase including but not limited to does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of proceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph expressly addressed to that category.  That would confuse the illustrative nature of the subsections list of categories with the contents of the categories themselves.  Reading the including but not limited to clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)s structure and grammar and in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous.  See generally id., at 410.  Subsection (h)(1)s context supports this Courts conclusion.  Subsection (h)(7) provides that delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, and records those findings.  In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection (h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time.  See 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii), 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv).  The Courts determination that the delay at issue is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.  The Courts precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1).  See Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502.  Pp.1016.


(c)The Act does not force a district court to choose between rejecting a defendants request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial.  A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings.  Subsection (h)(7) provides [m]uch of the Acts flexibility, Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts discretion  to accommodate limited delays for case-specific needs, id., at 499.  The Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the necessary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit.  But dismissal need not represent a windfall.  If the court dismisses the charges without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict.  In ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay.  Pp.1618.


(d)This Court does not consider whether any of the Acts other exclusions would apply to all or part of the September 7 through October 4 period that is not automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1).  P.18.

08-1119|"MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P.A., etal. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 081119.Argued December 1, 2009Decided March 8, 2010
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) amended the Bankruptcy Code to define a class of bankruptcy professionals termed debt relief agenc[ies].  11 U. S.C. 101(12A).  That class includes, with limited exceptions, any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person  for  payment , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.  Ibid.  The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from advis[ing] an assisted person  to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for bankruptcy] .  526(a)(4).  It also requires them to disclose in their advertisements for certain services that the services are with respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, 528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, 528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).  


The plaintiffs in this litigationa law firm and others (collectively Milavetz)filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, arguing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPAs debt-relief-agency provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertisements.  The District Court found that debt relief agency does not include attorneys and that 526 and 528 are unconstitutional as applied to that class of professionals.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Courts conclusion that attorneys are not debt relief agenc[ies]; upholding application of 528s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding 526(a)(4) unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from advising assisted persons to incur any additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning.
Held:
1.Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA.  By definition, bankruptcy assistance includes several services commonly performed by attorneys, e.g., providing advice, counsel, [or] document preparation, 101(4A).  Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude attorneys.  See 101(12A)(A)(E).  Milavetz relies on the fact that 101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a narrower understanding.  On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition preparer would qualifyan implausibility given that a debt relief agency is any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance  or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer, ibid. Milavetzs other arguments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive.  Pp.59.


2.Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.  The statutes language, together with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of 526(a)(4) the natural one.  Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v. Pender, 289 U. S. 472, supports this conclusion.  The Court in that case read now-repealed 96(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtors attorneys fees payment in contemplation of the filing of a petition, to require that the portended bankruptcy have induce[d] the transfer at issue, id., at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.  The Court identified the controlling question as whether the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction, ibid.  Given the substantial similarities between 96(d) and 526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise whether the impelling reason for advis[ing] an assisted person  to incur more debt was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.  In practice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of advice to load up on debt with the expectation of obtaining its discharge.  The statutory context supports the conclusion that 526(a)(4)s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct.  The Court rejects Milavetzs arguments for a more expansive view of 526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is impermissibly vague.  Pp.918.


3.Section 528s disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Milavetz.  Consistent with Milavetzs characterization, the Court presumes that this is an as-applied challenge.  Because 528 is directed at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less exacting scrutiny set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs.  There, the Court found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements offend the First Amendment, an advertisers rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the States interest in preventing deception of consumers.  Id., at 651.  Section 528s requirements share the essential features of the rule challenged in Zauderer.  The disclosures are intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the advertisers legal status and the character of the assistance provided.  Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying any additional information through their advertisements.  In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished.  Because 528s requirements are reasonably related to the Governments interest in preventing consumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Milavetz.  Pp.1823.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 08240.Argued January 19, 2010Decided March 2, 2010
The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) limits the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a service-station franchise or fail to renew a franchise relationship.  15 U. S.C. 2802, 2804.  Typically, the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee and permits the franchisee to use the franchisors trademark and purchase the franchisors fuel for resale.  2801(1).  As relevant here, service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively terminate[d] their franchises and constructively fail[ed] to renew their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for many of them.  The dealers asserted these claims even though they had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.  The jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law.  The First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, holding that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its franchise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a material change effectively ending the lease.  However, the court reversed as to the constructive nonrenewal claims, holding that such a claim cannot be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a renewal agreement.
Held:
1.A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under the Act if the franchisors allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise.  Pp.615.


(a)The Act provides that no franchisor  may  terminate any franchise, except for an enumerated reason and after giving written notice, 2802(a)(b), and specifies that termination includes cancellation, 2801(17).  Because it does not further define those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: put [to] an end or annul[ed] or destroy[ed].  Thus, the Act prohibits only franchisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise.  The same conclusion follows even if Congress used terminate and cancel in their technical, rather than ordinary, senses.  This conclusion is also consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termination doctrine as applied in analogous legal contextse.g., employment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.

Allowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a franchise to end would ignore the Acts scope, which is limited to the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state-law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchisees, see 2806(a).  This conclusion is also informed by important practical considerations, namely, that any standard for identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effectively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee continues to operate, would be indeterminate and unworkable.

2.A franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim under the Act.  The Acts text leaves no room for such an interpretation.  It is violated only when a franchisor fail[s] to renew a franchise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the required notice, see 2802, and it defines fail to renew as a failure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship, 2801(14).  A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry the threshold burden of showing a nonrenewal of the franchise relationship, 2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the franchisor has violated the Act.  Signing their renewal agreements under protest did not preserve the dealers ability to assert nonrenewal claims.  When a franchisee signs a renewal agreementeven under protestthere has been no fail[ure] to renew, and thus no violation of the Act.  The Acts structure and purpose confirm this interpretation.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 08240.Argued January 19, 2010Decided March 2, 2010
The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) limits the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a service-station franchise or fail to renew a franchise relationship.  15 U. S.C. 2802, 2804.  Typically, the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee and permits the franchisee to use the franchisors trademark and purchase the franchisors fuel for resale.  2801(1).  As relevant here, service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively terminate[d] their franchises and constructively fail[ed] to renew their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for many of them.  The dealers asserted these claims even though they had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.  The jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law.  The First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, holding that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its franchise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a material change effectively ending the lease.  However, the court reversed as to the constructive nonrenewal claims, holding that such a claim cannot be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a renewal agreement.
Held:
1.A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under the Act if the franchisors allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise.  Pp.615.


(a)The Act provides that no franchisor  may  terminate any franchise, except for an enumerated reason and after giving written notice, 2802(a)(b), and specifies that termination includes cancellation, 2801(17).  Because it does not further define those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: put [to] an end or annul[ed] or destroy[ed].  Thus, the Act prohibits only franchisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise.  The same conclusion follows even if Congress used terminate and cancel in their technical, rather than ordinary, senses.  This conclusion is also consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termination doctrine as applied in analogous legal contextse.g., employment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141143where a termination is deemed constructive only because the plaintiff, not the defendant, formally ends a particular legal relationshipnot because there is no end to the relationship at all.  Allowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a franchise to end would ignore the Acts scope, which is limited to the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state-law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchisees, see 2806(a).

 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES etal.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the district of
columbia circuit
No. 081234.Decided March 1, 2010
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), on the question whether a federal court exercising habeas jurisdiction has the power to order the release of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay where the Executive detention is indefinite and without authorization in law, and release into the continental United States is the only possible effective remedy, Pet. for Cert. i.  By now, however, each of the detainees at issue in this case has received at least one offer of resettlement in another country.  Most of the detainees have accepted an offer of resettlement; five detainees, however, have rejected two such offers and are still being held at Guantanamo Bay.


This change in the underlying facts may affect the legal issues presented.  No court has yet ruled in this case in light of the new facts, and we decline to be the first to do so.  See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005) ([W]e are a court of review, not of first view).


Under these circumstances, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  It should determine, in the first instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District Court are necessary and appropriate for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the new developments.
It is so ordered.

08-6925|"JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 086925.Argued October 6, 2009Decided March 2, 2010
Petitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.  18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1).  The Government sought sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an enhanced penalty for a person who violates 922(g) and who has three previous convictions for a violent felony, 924(e)(1), defined as, inter alia, an offense that has as an element the use  of physical force against the person of another, 924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Among the three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was Johnsons 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. 784.03(1)(b), but was a felony conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of another battery, Fla. Stat. 784.03(2).  Under Florida law, a battery occurs when a personeither [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against [his] will, or [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.  784.03(1)(a).  Nothing in the record permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnsons 2003 conviction rested upon the strik[ing] or [i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily harm elements of the offense.  Accordingly, his conviction was a predicate conviction for a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act only if [a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing] another constitutes the use of physical force under 924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Concluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnsons sentence under 924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The Florida felony offense of battery by [a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing] another person does not have as an element the use  of physical force against the person of another, 924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus does not constitute a violent felony under 924(e)(1).  Pp.312.
(a)In interpreting the phrase physical force in 924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Courts conclusion in State v. Hearns, 961 So.2d 211, 218, that, under Floridas statutory equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. 775.084, the offense of battery does not involve the use . . . of physical force or violence against any individual, Fla. Stat. 776.08.  The meaning of physical force in 924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not state law.  The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme Courts interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, including the Florida Supreme Courts holding that 784.03(1)(a)s element of [a]ctually and intentionally touching another person is satisfied by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight.  Pp.34. 


(b)Because 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define physical force, the Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning.  Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144145.  The adjective physical is clear.  The noun force, however, has a number of meanings.  Its ordinary meaning refers to the application of strength, power, and violencein this context, against another person.  Pp.45.  


(c)The Government suggests that force in 924(e)(2)(B)(i)s definition of violent felony is a legal term of art describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery.  At common law, that element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.  Although a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit.  Here physical force is used in defining not the crime of battery, but rather the statutory category of violent felony.  924(e)(2)(B)(i).  In that context, physical force means violent forcei.e., force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  Cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11.  Moreover, it is significant that the meaning the Government seeks to impute to the term force derives from the elements of a common-law misdemeanor.  Nothing in the text of 924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that force in the definition of a violent felony should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define the contours of a misdemeanor.  Nor can any negative inference about the amount of force required by 924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn from 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Pp.59. 


(d)There is no force to the Governments prediction that this decision will undermine its ability to enforce 922(g)(9)s firearm disability against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence that has as an element the use . . .  of physical force, 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  The Court interprets the phrase physical force only in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony, and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses.  Similarly misplaced is the Governments assertion that it will now be more difficult to obtain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under generic felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence, 8 U. S.C. 1227(a)(2)(E).  See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26.  Pp.911. 


(e)Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reliance upon the so-called residual clause of the definition of violent felony in 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for consideration whether Johnsons 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under that provision.  Pp.1112.    
528 F.3d 1318, reversed and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.

08-1175|"FLORIDA v. POWELL
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 081175.Argued December 7, 2009Decided February 23, 2010
In a pathmarking decision, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 471, this Court held that an individual must be clearly informed, prior to custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.


After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him, Tampa Police read him their standard Miranda form, stating, inter alia: You have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of our questions and [y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview.  Powell then admitted he owned a handgun found in a police search.  He was charged with possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.  The trial court denied Powells motion to suppress his inculpatory statements, which was based on the contention that the Miranda warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney during questioning.  Powell was convicted of the gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that the trial court should have suppressed the statements.  The Florida Supreme Court agreed.  It noted that both Miranda and the State Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.  The advice Powell received was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsels presence throughout the interrogation.  
Held: 
1.This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case.  Powell contends that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied on the States Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729.  Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 10401041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law, and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that federal law controlled the state courts decision.  Although invoking Floridas Constitution and precedent in addition to this Courts decisions, the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in Miranda.  See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.  The state-court opinion consistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what Florida law independently requires.  This Court therefore cannot identify, from the face of the opinion, a clear statement that the decision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda.  See Long, 463 U. S., at 1041.  Because the opinion does not indicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent [state] grounds, Long, 463 U. S., at 1041, this Court has jurisdiction.  Pp.47. 


2.Advice that a suspect has the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the law enforcement officers] questions, and that he can invoke this right at any time  during th[e] interview, satisfies Miranda.  Pp.713.


(a)Miranda requires that a suspect be warned prior to any questioning  that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.  384 U. S., at 479.  This Miranda warning addresses the Courts particular concern that [t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.  Id., at 469.  Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as an absolute prerequisite to interrogation, that an individual held for questioning must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.  Id., at 471.  While the warnings prescribed by Miranda are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.  See, e.g., California v. Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359.  In determining whether police warnings were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to examine [them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.  The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.  Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203.  Pp.79. 


(b)The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard.  By informing Powell that he had the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [their] questions, the Tampa officers communicated that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular question.  And the statement that Powell had the right to use any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview confirmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the interrogation was underway.  In combination, the two warnings reasonably conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all times.  To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each query.  Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Courts conclusion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language that Powell could talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers] questions suggested he could consult with an attorney only before the interrogation started.  In context, the term before merely conveyed that Powells right to an attorney became effective before he answered any questions at all.  Nothing in the words used indicated that counsels presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.  Powell suggests that todays holding will tempt law enforcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambiguity.  But, as the Federal Government explains, it is in law enforcements own interest to state warnings with maximum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspects statement.  The standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise formulation necessary to meet Mirandas requirements.  Different words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communicated the same message.  Pp.913.
998 So.2d 531, reversed and remanded.

1.This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case.  Powell contends that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied on the States Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729.  Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 10401041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law, and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that federal law controlled the state courts decision.  Although invoking Floridas Constitution and precedent in addition to this Courts decisions, the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in Miranda.  See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.  The state-court opinion consistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what Florida law independently requires.  This Court therefore cannot identify, from the face of the opinion, a clear statement that the decision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda.  See Long, 463 U. S., at 1041.  Because the opinion does not indicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent [state] grounds, Long, 463 U. S., at 1041, this Court has jurisdiction.  Pp.47. 


2.Advice that a suspect has the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the law enforcement officers] questions, and that he can invoke this right at any time  during th[e] interview, satisfies Miranda.  Pp.713.


(a)Miranda requires that a suspect be warned prior to any questioning  that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.  384 U. S., at 479.  This Miranda warning addresses the Courts particular concern that [t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.  Id., at 469.  Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as an absolute prerequisite to interrogation, that an individual held for questioning must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.  Id., at 471.  While the warnings prescribed by Miranda are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.  See, e.g., California v. Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359.  In determining whether police warnings were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to examine [them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.  The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.  Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203.  Pp.79. 


(b)The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard.  By informing Powell that he had the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [their] questions, the Tampa officers communicated that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular question.  And the statement that Powell had the right to use any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview confirmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the interrogation was underway.  In combination, the two warnings reasonably conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all times.  To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each query.  Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Courts conclusion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language that Powell could talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers] questions suggested he could consult with an attorney only before the interrogation started.  In context, the term before merely conveyed that Powells right to an attorney became effective before he answered any questions at all.  Nothing in the words used indicated that counsels presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.  Powell suggests that todays holding will tempt law enforcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambiguity.  But, as the Federal Government explains, it is in law enforcements own interest to state warnings with maximum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspects statement.  The standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise formulation necessary to meet Mirandas requirements.  Different words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communicated the same message.  Pp.913.

No. 08103.Argued October 7, 2009Decided March 2, 2010
The Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register their works before suing for copyright infringement.  17 U. S.C.A. 411(a).  The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright infringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with 411(a).  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their works and authors who had not.  The parties moved the District Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agreement.  The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance authors.  On appeal, the Second Circuit sU. S.onte raised the question whether 411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights, concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the class or approve the settlement.
Held:Section 411(a)s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a copyright infringement claim.  A copyright holders failure to comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered works.  Pp.516.
(a)Jurisdiction refers to a courts adjudicatory authority, Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455.  Thus, jurisdictional properly applies only to prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) implicating that authority.  Ibid.  Because the distinction between jurisdictional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in practice, federal courts and litigants should use the term jurisdictional only when it is apposite.  Ibid.  A statutory requirement is considered jurisdictional if Congress clearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdictional; a condition not rank[ed] as such should be treated as nonjurisdictional in character.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515516.  In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not clearly stat[e] that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional, this Courts prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirements location in a provision separate from Title VIIs jurisdiction-granting section indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdictional.  Pp.57.


(b)Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, 411(a) does not clearly stat[e] that its registration requirement is jurisdictional.  546 U. S., at 515.  Although 411(a)s last sentence contains the word jurisdiction, that sentence speaks to a courts adjudicatory authority to determine a copyright claims registrability and says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.  Moreover, 411(a)s registration requirement, like Title VIIs employee-numerosity requirement, is located in a provision separate from those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that 411(a)s registration requirement can be read to speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts, ibid.  This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee-numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit.  See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393.  Pp.711.


(c)A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205.  There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28 U. S.C. 2107s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed 2107s specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type of limitation.  That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh framework because context is relevant to whether a statute rank[s] a requirement as jurisdictional.  Pp.1114.


(d)The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Second Circuits judgment vacating the settlement.  While some of petitioners arguments below are in tension with those made in this Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of inconsistent court determinations in their favor that estoppel is meant to address.  See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742.  Pp.1415.


(e)Because 411(a) does not restrict a federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction, this Court need not address the question whether the District Court had authority to approve the settlement under the Second Circuits erroneous reading of 411.  The Court also declines to decide whether 411(a)s registration requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit that district courts may or should enforce sU. S.onte by dismissing copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works.  Pp.1516.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 081107.Argued November 10, 2009Decided February 23, 2010
Respondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a California state court for claimed state-law violations.  Hertz sought removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S.C. 1332(d)(2), 1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of different States, 1332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  Respondents, however, claimed that Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diversity jurisdiction was lacking under 1332(c)(1), which provides that a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.  To show that its principal place of business was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States, that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity, that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey, and that its core executive and administrative functions are primarily carried out there.  The District Court concluded that it lacked diversity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount of the corporations business activity is significantly larger or substantially predominates in one State.  Finding that California was Hertzs principal place of business under that test because a plurality of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court remanded the case to state court.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
Held:
1.Respondents argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 1453(c)which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as the District Courts only to court[s] of appeals, not to the Supreme Court, and provides that if a final judgment on the appeal in a court of appeals is not issued before the end of 60 days (with a possible 10-day extension), the appeal shall be deniedmakes far too much of too little.  The Court normally does not read statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants.  E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660661.  Here, replicating similar, older statutes, 1254 specifically gives the Court jurisdiction to revie[w]  [b]y writ of certiorari cases that are in the courts of appeals when it grants the writ.  The Court thus interprets 1453(c)s 60-day requirement as simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified timenot to deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case.  See, e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466467.  Pp.45.


2.The phrase principal place of business in 1332(c)(1) refers to the place where a corporations high level officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporations activities, i.e., its nerve center, which will typically be found at its corporate headquarters.  Pp.519.


(a)A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdiction demonstrates that Congress added 1332(c)(1)s principal place of business language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court jurisdiction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases.  Pp.510. 


(b)However, the phrase principal place of business has proved more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.  After Congress amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporations principal place of business for diversity purposes.  If a corporations headquarters and executive offices were in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed straightforward.  The principal place of business was in that State.  But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were in one State, while the corporations plants or other centers of business activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvious.  Under these circumstances, for corporations with far-flung business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporations nerve center, from which the corporation radiates out to its constituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporations activities.  However, this test did not go far enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corporations operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few States.  When faced with this question, various courts have focused more heavily on where a corporations actual business activities are located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to interpret the statute.  Pp.1013. 


(c)In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of the statutory phrase, this Court returns to the nerve center approach: [P]rincipal place of business is best read as referring to the place where a corporations officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporations activities.  In practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquartersprovided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the nerve center, and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings.  Pp.1319.


(i)Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the Court that the nerve center approach, while imperfect, is superior to other possibilities.  First, 1332(c)(1)s language supports the approach.  The statutes word place is singular, not plural.  Its word principal requires that the main, prominent, or most important place be chosen.  Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168, 174.  And the fact that the word place follows the words State where means that the place is a place within a State, not the State itself.  A corporations nerve center, usually its main headquarters, is a single place.  The public often considers it the corporations main place of business.  And it is a place within a State.  By contrast, the application of a more general business activities test has led some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within a State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total amount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and determining whether they are significantly larger than in the next-ranking State.  Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.  Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375.  A nerve center approach, which ordinarily equates that center with a corporations headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.  By contrast, a corporations general business activities more often lack a single principal place where they take place.  Third, the statutes legislative history suggests that the words principal place of business should be interpreted to be no more complex than an earlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical to apply.  A nerve center test offers such a possibility.  A general business activities test does not.  Pp.1417. 


(ii)While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under the nerve center test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to apply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets or revenues different in kind, one from the other.  And though this test may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale of diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system.  Pp.1718.


(iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipulationfor example, that the alleged nerve center is nothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of an annual executive retreatthe courts should instead take as the nerve center the place of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the absence of such manipulation.  Pp.1819.


(d)Although petitioners unchallenged declaration suggests that Hertzs nerve center and its corporate headquarters are one and the same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, respondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their case in light of todays holding.  P.19.

08-10914|"JAMEY L. WILKINS v. OFFICER GADDY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 0810914.Decided February 22, 2010
Per Curiam.

In Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this Court held that the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment [even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.  In this case, the District Court dismissed a prisoners excessive force claim based entirely on its determination that his injuries were de minimis.  Because the District Courts approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with Hudsons direction to decide excessive force claims based on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed.
I

In March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina pursuant to 42 U. S.C. 1983.  Wilkins pro se complaint alleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was maliciously and sadistically assaulted [w]ithout any provocation by a corrections officer, respondent Gaddy.[Footnote 1]  App. to Pet. for Cert. C4.  According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently angered by Wilkins request for a grievance form, snatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto the concrete floor.  Ibid.  Gaddy then proceeded to punch, kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to physically remove him from [Wilkins].  Ibid.  Wilkins further alleged that, [a]s a result of the excessive force used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood pressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness and psychological trauma and mental anguish including depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.  Ibid.
The District Court, on its own motion and without a response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins complaint for failure to state a claim.  Citing Circuit precedent, the court stated that, [i]n order to state an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish that he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.  No. 3:08cv00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp.1, 2 (citing Taylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v. Dorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); footnote omitted).  According to the court, Wilkins alleged injuries were no more severe than those deemed de minimis in the Circuits Taylor and Riley decisions.  Indeed, the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his injuries had required medical attention.


In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment might prejudice his claim.  He asserted that he had been prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his headaches and back pain, as well as for depression.  And he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his injuries and course of treatment.  


Describing reconsideration as an extraordinary remedy, the court declined to revisit its previous ruling.  No. 3:08cv00138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p.1.  The medical records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wilkins alleged injuries were pre-existing conditions.  Id., at 3.  Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pressure and mental health issues even before the assault.  The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray after the incident to examine his bruised heel,  but it note[d] that bruising is generally considered a de minimus [sic] injury.  Id., at 4.  The court similarly characterized as de minimis Wilkins complaints of back pain and headaches.  The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his complaint.  In a summary disposition, the Court of Appeals affirmed for the reasons stated by the district court.  No. 087881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).
II

In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant injury in order to state an excessive force claim, the Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this Court in Hudson.  Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson filed suit under 1983 alleging that corrections officers had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Evidence indicated that the officers had punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach without justification, resulting in minor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip as well as loosened teeth and a cracked partial dental plate.  503 U. S., at 4.  A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudsons favor, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that an inmate must prove a significant injury in order to state an excessive force claim.  Hudson v. McMillian, 929 F.2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam).  According to the Court of Appeals, Hudsons injuries, which had not required medical attention, were too minor to warrant relief.  Ibid.
Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the notion that significant injury is a threshold requirement for stating an excessive force claim.  The core judicial inquiry, we held, was not whether a certain quantum of injury was sustained, but rather whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.  503 U. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319321 (1986).  When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, the Court recognized, contemporary standards of decency always are violated  whether or not significant injury is evident.  Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.  Hudson, 503 U. S., at 9; see also id., at 1314 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (The Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when coupled with significant injury, e.g., injury that requires medical attention or leaves permanent marks).


This is not to say that the absence of serious injury is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry.  Id., at 7.  [T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary in a particular situation.  Ibid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321).  The extent of injury may also provide some indication of the amount of force applied.  As we stated in Hudson, not every malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.  503 U. S., at 9.  The Eighth Amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.  Ibid. (some internal quotation marks omitted).  An inmate who complains of a push or shove that causes no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.  Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (CA2 1973)).


Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts.  An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury.  Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that the supposedly minor nature of the injuries provide[d] no basis for dismissal of [Hudsons] 1983 claim because the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are not de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.  503 U. S., at 10.


The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite similar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Courts analysis closely resembles the approach Hudson disavowed.  Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked, kneed, choked, and body slammed maliciously and sadistically and [w]ithout any provocation.  Dismissing Wilkins action sU. S.onte, the District Court did not hold that this purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a bruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medical treatment, involved de minimis force.  Instead, the court concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim because he simply has not alleged that he suffered anything more than de minimus [sic] injury.  No. 3:08cv00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at2.


In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis nature of Wilkins injuries, the District Court relied on two Fourth Circuit cases.  See Riley, 115 F.3d, at 11661168; Taylor, 155 F.3d, at 483485.  Those cases, in turn, were based upon the Fourth Circuits earlier decision in Norman v. Taylor, 25 F.3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which approved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.  According to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson does not foreclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view  that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim if his injuries are de minimis.  25 F.3d, at 1263.


The Fourth Circuits strained reading of Hudson is not defensible.  This Courts decision did not, as the Fourth Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury threshold for excessive force claims from significant to non-de minimiswhatever those ill-defined terms might mean.  Instead, the Court aimed to shift the core judicial inquiry from the extent of the injury to the nature of the forcespecifically, whether it was nontrivial and was applied  maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.  503 U. S., at 7.  To conclude, as the District Court did here, that the absence of some arbitrary quantity of injury requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry.  Id., at 9.[Footnote 2]


In holding that the District Court erred in dismissing Wilkins complaint based on the supposedly de minimis nature of his injuries, we express no view on the underlying merits of his excessive force claim.  In order to prevail, Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the assault actually occurred but also that it was carried out maliciously and sadistically rather than as part of a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.  Ibid.  Moreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may recover.

***
The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
The materials in the record do not disclose Gaddys full name.
Most Circuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Circuits de minimis injury requirement.  See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554 F.3d 255, 269270 (CA2 2009) ([O]ur Court has reversed summary dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where the plaintiffs evidence of injury was slight  . [T]he absence of any significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of such injury if the defendants use of force was malicious or sadistic); Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 648649 (CA3 2002) ([T]he Eighth Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries.  [D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force); Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view that to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical injury (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee, 439 F.3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).


The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement with the Fourth Circuits approach.  See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163 F.3d 921, 924 (1999) ([T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis injury).  But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F.3d 384, 386 (2006) (This Court has never directly held that injuries must reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force claim).  Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have survived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that courts precedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de minimis.  See, e.g., ibid. (permitting a prisoners Eighth Amendment excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that the prisoner suffered one-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left thumb, as well as back problems); Gomez, 163 F.3d, at 922 (refusing to grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the prisoner alleged physical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts, scrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body).

08-680|"MARYLAND v. SHATZER
certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland
No. 08680.Argued October 5, 2009Decided February 24, 2010
In 2003, a police detective tried to question respondent Shatzer, who was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction, about allegations that he had sexually abused his son.  Shatzer invoked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interrogation, so the detective terminated the interview.  Shatzer was released back into the general prison population, and the investigation was closed.  Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and attempted to interrogate Shatzer, who was still incarcerated.  Shatzer waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements.  The trial court refused to suppress those statements, reasoning that Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, did not apply because Shatzer had experienced a break in Miranda custody prior to the 2006 interrogation.  Shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse.  The Court of Appeals of Maryland reversed, holding that the mere passage of time does not end the Edwards protections, and that, assuming, arguendo, a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed, Shatzers release back into the general prison population did not constitute such a break.
Held:Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not mandate suppression of his 2006 statements.  Pp.418.
(a)Edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the Miranda right to the presence of counsel, any waiver of that right in response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is involuntary.  Edwards fundamental purpose is to [p]reserv[e] the integrity of an accuseds choice to communicate with police only through counsel, Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291, by prevent[ing] police from badgering [him] into waiving his previously asserted Miranda rights, Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350.  It is easy to believe that a suspects later waiver was coerced or badgered when he has been held in uninterrupted Miranda custody since his first refusal to waive.  He remains cut off from his normal life and isolated in a police-dominated atmosphere, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 456, where his captors appear to control [his] fate, Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297.  But where a suspect has been released from custody and returned to his normal life for some time before the later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to think that his change of heart has been coerced.  Because the Edwards presumption has been established by opinion of this Court, it is appropriate for this Court to specify the period of release from custody that will terminate its application.  See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44.  The Court concludes that the appropriate period is 14 days, which provides ample time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, consult with friends and counsel, and shake off any residual coercive effects of prior custody.  Pp.413.


(b)Shatzers release back into the general prison population constitutes a break in Miranda custody.  Lawful imprisonment imposed upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by investigative custody that justify Edwards.  When previously incarcerated suspects are released back into the general prison population, they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routinethey regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the attempted interrogation.  Their continued detention is relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investigation.  The inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation ended when Shatzer returned to his normal life.  Pp.1316.
405 Md. 585, 954 A.2d 1118, reversed and remanded.

09-273|"RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT
OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTI-
TUTIONS DIVISION v. ANTHONY CARDELL
HAYNES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 09273.Decided February 22, 2010
Per Curiam.

This case presents the question whether any decision of this Court clearly establishes that a judge, in ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor-based explanation for the challenge unless the judge personally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective jurors demeanor on which the explanation is based.  The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that either Batson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008), clearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals read far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if allowed to stand, would have important implications.  We therefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
I

Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the murder of a police officer, and the State sought the death penalty.  During voir dire, two judges presided at different stages.  Judge Harper presided when the attorneys questioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge Wallace took over when peremptory challenges were exercised.  When the prosecutor struck an African-American juror named Owens, respondents attorney raised a Batson objection.  Judge Wallace determined that respondent had made out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prosecutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was based on Owens demeanor during individual questioning.  Specifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens demeanor had been somewhat humorous and not serious and that her body language had belied her true feeling.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 187.  Based on his observations of Owens during questioning by respondents attorney, the prosecutor stated, he believed that she had a predisposition and would not look at the possibility of imposing a death sentence in a neutral fashion.  Id., at 188.  Respondents attorney did not dispute the prosecutors characterization of Owens demeanor, but he asserted that her answers on the jury questionnaire show[ed] that she was a juror who [was] leaning towards the States case.  Ibid.  After considering the prosecutors explanation and the arguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that the prosecutors reason for the strike was race-neutral and denied the Batson objection without further explanation.  Id., at 189.
 The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction.  Rejecting respondents argument that a trial judge who did not witness the actual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate a Batson challenge, id., at 173, the Court of Criminal Appeals wrote:
There are many factors which a trial judgeeven one who did not preside over the voir dire examinationscan consider in determining whether the opponent of the peremptory strikes has met his burden.  These include the nature and strength of the parties arguments during the Batson hearing and the attorneys demeanor and credibility.  And, when necessary, a trial judge who has not witnessed the voir dire may refer to the record, id., at 173174 (footnote omitted).

With respect to the strike of juror Owens, the court held that Judge Wallaces acceptance of the prosecutors explanation was not clearly erroneous and noted that [t]he record does reflect that Owens was congenial and easygoing during voir dire and that her attitude was less formal than that of other veniremembers.  Id., at 172.  This Court denied respondents petition for a writ of certiorari.  Haynes v. Texas, 535 U. S. 999 (2002).


After the Texas courts denied his application for state habeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition.  The District Court denied the petition and observed that this Court had never held that the deference to state-court factual determinations that is mandated by the federal habeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on a Batson objection did not observe the jury selection.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80, n.10.


A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of appealability with respect to respondents Batson objections concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.  Haynes v. Quarterman, 526 F.3d 189, 202 (CA5 2008).  In its opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed our opinion in Snyder at length and then concluded:
Under Snyders application of Batson,  an appellate court applying Batson arguably should find clear error when the record reflects that the trial court was not able to verify the aspect of the jurors demeanor upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremptory challenge.  526 F.3d, at 199.

When the same panel later ruled on the merits of respondents Batson claim regarding juror Owens,[Footnote 1] the court adopted the rule that it had previously termed arguabl[e].  See 526 F.3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman, 561 F.3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009).  The court concluded that the decisions of the state courts were not owed AEDPA deference in this case because the state courts engaged in pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns entirely on demeanor.  Ibid.  The court then held that
no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper adjudication of the defendants demeanor-based Batson challenge as to prospective juror Owens because we will be relying solely on a paper record and would thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established factual inquiry requirement.  See, e.g., Snyder, [552 U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].  Ibid. (footnote omitted).
II

Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.  A legal principle is clearly established within the meaning of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding of this Court.  See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 74 (2006); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000).  Under 2254(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief (1) if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts; or (2) if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Courts decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoners case.  Id., at 413.
III

In holding that respondent is entitled to a new trial, the Court of Appeals cited two decisions of this Court, Batson and Snyder, but neither of these cases held that a demeanor-based explanation for a peremptory challenge must be rejected unless the judge personally observed
and recalls the relevant aspect of the prospective jurors demeanor.
The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that Batson supports its decision because Batson requires a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to undertake a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.  561 F.3d, at 540 (quoting Batson, 476 U. S., at 93, in turn quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)).  This general requirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on which the Court of Appeals decision rests.  Batson noted the need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to tak[e] into account all possible explanatory factors in the particular case, 476 U. S., at 95 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S. 162, 170 (2005).  Thus, where the explanation for a peremptory challenge is based on a prospective jurors demeanor, the judge should take into account, among other things, any observations of the juror that the judge was able to make during the voir dire.  But Batson plainly did not go further and hold that a demeanor-based explanation must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot recall the jurors demeanor.


Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.[Footnote 2]  In that case, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled on the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to consider how Batson applies when different judges preside over these two stages of the jury selection process.  Snyder, 552 U. S., at 475478.  The part of Snyder on which the Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different problem.  The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had exercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of which was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had appeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the Batson objection without explanation.  552 U. S., at 478479.  We concluded that the record refuted the explanation that was not based on demeanor and, in light of the particular circumstances of the case, we held that the peremptory challenge could not be sustained on the demeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the trial judges unexplained ruling.  Id., at 479486.  Nothing in this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the decision below appears to rest.


The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explanation for a peremptory challenge invoke[s] a jurors demeanor, the trial judges first hand observations are of great importance.  Id., at 477.  And in explaining why we could not assume that the trial judge had credited the claim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because the peremptory challenge was not exercised until some time after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might not have recalled the jurors demeanor.  Id., at 479.  These observations do not suggest that, in the absence of a personal recollection of the jurors demeanor, the judge could not have accepted the prosecutors explanation.  Indeed, Snyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best evidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is often that attorneys demeanor.  See 552 U. S., at 477.


Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court clearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court of Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Our decision does not mandate the rejection of respondents Batson claim regarding juror Owens.  On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals determination may be overcome under the federal habeas statutes standard for reviewing a state courts resolution of questions of fact.
It is so ordered.
Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violated Batson, the panel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a certificate of appealability had been issued.  Haynes v. Quarterman, 561 F.3d 535, 541, n.2 (CA5 2009).
Even if Snyder did alter or add to Batsons rule (as the Court of Appeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted clearly established Federal law as determined by this Court for purposes of respondents habeas petition because we decided Snyder nearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six years after the relevant state-court decision.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.); id., at 412 (opinion for the Court by OConnor, J.).

08-205|"CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 08205.Argued March 24, 2009Reargued September 9, 2009Decided January 21, 2010
As amended by 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that is an electioneering communication or for speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate.  2 U. S.C. 441b.  An electioneering communication is any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office and is made within 30 days of a primary election, 434(f)(3)(A), and that is publicly distributed, 11 CFR 100.29(a)(2), which in the case of a candidate for nomination for President  means that the communication [c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election  is being held within 30 days, 100.29(b)(3)(ii).  Corporations and unions may establish a political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneering communications purposes.  2 U. S.C. 441b(b)(2).  In McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, 203209, this Court upheld limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speakers corporate identity.


In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her partys Presidential nomination.  Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast and cable television.  Concerned about possible civil and criminal penalties for violating 441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that (1) 441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRAs disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements, BCRA 201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and the ads.  The District Court denied Citizens United a preliminary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC) summary judgment. 
Held:
1.Because the question whether 441b applies to Hillary cannot be resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech, this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in Austin.  Pp.520.


(a)Citizen Uniteds narrower argumentsthat Hillary is not an electioneering communication covered by 441b because it is not publicly distributed under 11 CFR 100.29(a)(2); that 441b may not be applied to Hillary under Federal Election Commn v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (WRTL), which found 441b unconstitutional as applied to speech that was not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, id., at 481 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.), determining that a communication is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, id., at 469470; that 441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand because this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads; and that there should be an exception to 441bs ban for nonprofit corporate political speech funded overwhelming by individualsare not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute.  Pp.512.


(b)Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the First Amendments meaning and purpose.  Citizens United did not waive this challenge to Austin when it stipulated to dismissing the facial challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived, this Court may reconsider Austin and 441bs facial validity here because the District Court passed upon the issue, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379; (2) throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Because Citizen Uniteds narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider 441bs facial validity.  Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide chilling effect caused by 441bs corporate expenditure ban.  This conclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty caused by the Governments litigating position; (2) substantial time would be required to clarify 441bs application on the points raised by the Governments position in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is of primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any speech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating political speech is chilled.  The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a prior restraint in the strict sense.  However, given its complexity and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak.  The restrictions thus function as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power analogous to the type of government practices that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.   The ongoing chill on speech makes it necessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.  Pp.1220.


2.Austin is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.  Hence, 441bs restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be applied to Hillary.  Given this conclusion, the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA 203s extension of 441bs restrictions on independent corporate expenditures is also overruled.  Pp.2051.


(a)Although the First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech, 441bs prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech, backed by criminal sanctions.  It is a ban notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a separate association from the corporation.  Because speech is an essential mechanism of democracyit is the means to hold officials accountable to the peoplepolitical speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it by design or inadvertence.  Laws burdening such speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. WRTL, 551 U. S., at 464.  This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting the interests in this case.  Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speakers, which may be a means to control content.  The Government may also commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.  There is no basis for the proposition that, in the political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.  Both history and logic lead to this conclusion.  Pp.2025.


(b)The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428429.  Addressing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the Buckley Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18 U. S.C. 608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.  424 U. S., at 2526.  However, the Court invalidated 608(e)s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals, corporations, and unions, because it fail[ed] to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process, id., at 4748.  While Buckley did not consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures found in 610, had that provision been challenged in Buckleys wake, it could not have been squared with the precedents reasoning and analysis.  The Buckley Court did not invoke the overbreadth doctrine to suggest that 608(e)s expenditure ban would have been constitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not individuals.   Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified 610s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S.C. 441b, the provision at issue.  Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the power to restrict political speech based on the speakers corporate identity.  435 U.S., at 784785.  Thus the law stood until Austin upheld a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing Buckley and Bellotti by recognizing a new governmental interest in preventing the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth  that have little or no correlation to the publics support for the corporations political ideas.  494 U. S., at 660.  Pp.2532.


(c)This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-Austin line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speakers corporate identity and a post-Austin line permitting them.  Neither Austins antidistortion rationale nor the Governments other justifications support 441bs restrictions.  Pp.3247.


(1)The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political speech, but Austins antidistortion rationale would permit the Government to ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corporate form.  Political speech is indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation.  Bellotti, supra, at 777 (footnote omitted).  This protection is inconsistent with Austins rationale, which is meant to prevent corporations from obtaining an unfair advantage in the political marketplace by using resources amassed in the economic marketplace.  494 U. S., at 659.  First Amendment protections do not depend on the speakers financial ability to engage in public discussion.  Buckley, supra, at 49.  These conclusions were reaffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  Davis v. Federal Election Commn, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  Distinguishing wealthy individuals from corporations based on the latters special advantages of, e.g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting speech.  It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate funds may have little or no correlation to the publics support for the corporations political ideas. Austin, supra, at 660.  All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the resulting speech.  Under the antidistortion rationale, Congress could also ban political speech of media corporations.  Although currently exempt from 441b, they accumulate wealth with the help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth, and may express views hav[ing] little or no correlation to the publics support for those views.  Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations cannot be squared with the First Amendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amendments original meaning would permit suppressing media corporations political speech.  Austin interferes with the open marketplace of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208.  Its censorship is vast in its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit, both small and large, corporations.  Pp.3240.


(2)This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Governments other arguments.  It reasons that corporate political speech can be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance.  The Buckley Court found this rationale sufficiently important to allow contribution limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here.   While a single Bellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  That speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt.  And the appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.  Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished.  Pp.4045.


(3)The Governments asserted interest in protecting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political speech even of media corporations.  The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a dissenting shareholders interests in certain media for 30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media at any time.  It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder.  P. 46. 


(4)Because 441b is not limited to corporations or associations created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recognize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence over the Nations political process.  Pp.4647.


(d)The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare decisis, beyond workabilitythe precedents antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasonedcounsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the precedents of Buckley and Bellotti.  As already explained, Austin was not well reasoned.  It is also undermined by experience since its announcement.  Political speech is so ingrained in this countrys culture that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws.  Rapid changes in technologyand the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expressioncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  In addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake.  Thus, due consideration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled.   The Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech based on the speakers corporate identity.  No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.  Pp.4750.


3.BCRA 201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for Hillary and to the movie itself.  Pp.5057.


(a)Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, or prevent anyone from speaking, McConnell, supra, at 201.  The Buckley Court explained that disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing the electorate with information about election-related spending sources.  The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to 201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  However, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a reasonable probability that disclosing its contributors names would subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.  Id., at 198.  Pp.5052.


(b)The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Citizens Uniteds ads.  They fall within BCRAs electioneering communication definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy.  Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and insure that the voters are fully informed about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76.  At the very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.  Citizens Uniteds arguments that 311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that 311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the groups speech were rejected in McConnell.  This Court also rejects their contention that 201s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTLs test for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469476 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  Disclosure is the less-restrictive alternative to more comprehensive speech regulations.  Such requirements have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell.  Citizens Uniteds argument that no informational interest justifies applying 201 to its ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to disclaimers.  Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or reprisals that might make 201 unconstitutional as applied.  Pp.5255.


(c)For these same reasons, this Court affirms the application of the 201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Hillary.  Pp.5556.
Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined, in which Thomas, J., joined as to all but Part IV, and in which Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined as to Part IV.  Roberts, C.J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Alito, J., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Alito, J., joined, and in which Thomas, J., joined in part.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.

(a)Citizen Uniteds narrower argumentsthat Hillary is not an electioneering communication covered by 441b because it is not publicly distributed under 11 CFR 100.29(a)(2); that 441b may not be applied to Hillary under Federal Election Commn v.

Austin interferes with the open marketplace of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208.  Its censorship is vast in its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit, both small and large, corporations.  Pp.3240.


(2)This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Governments other arguments.  It reasons that corporate political speech can be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance.  The Buckley Court found this rationale sufficiently important to allow contribution limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here.   While a single Bellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  That speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt.  And the appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.  Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished.  Pp.4045.


(3)The Governments asserted interest in protecting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political speech even of media corporations.  The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a dissenting shareholders interests in certain media for 30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media at any time.  It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder.  P. 46. 


(4)Because 441b is not limited to corporations or associations created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recognize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence over the Nations political process.  Pp.4647.


(d)The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare decisis, beyond workabilitythe precedents antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasonedcounsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the precedents of Buckley and Bellotti.  As already explained, Austin was not well reasoned.  It is also undermined by experience since its announcement.  Political speech is so ingrained in this countrys culture that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws.  Rapid changes in technologyand the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expressioncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  In addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake.  Thus, due consideration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled.   The Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech based on the speakers corporate identity.  No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.  Pp.4750.


3.BCRA 201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for Hillary and to the movie itself.  Pp.5057.


(a)Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, or prevent anyone from speaking, McConnell, supra, at 201.  The Buckley Court explained that disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing the electorate with information about election-related spending sources.  The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to 201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  However, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a reasonable probability that disclosing its contributors names would subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.  Id., at 198.  Pp.5052.


(b)The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Citizens Uniteds ads.  They fall within BCRAs electioneering communication definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy.  Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and insure that the voters are fully informed about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76.  At the very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.  Citizens Uniteds arguments that 311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that 311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the groups speech were rejected in McConnell.  This Court also rejects their contention that 201s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTLs test for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469476 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  Disclosure is the less-restrictive alternative to more comprehensive speech regulations.  Such requirements have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell.  Citizens Uniteds argument that no informational interest justifies applying 201 to its ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to disclaimers.  Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or reprisals that might make 201 unconstitutional as applied.  Pp.5255.


(c)For these same reasons, this Court affirms the application of the 201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Hillary.  Pp.5556.

08-969|"HEMI GROUP, LLC, etal. v. CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW YORK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 08969.Argued November 3, 2009Decided January 25, 2010
Respondent New York City taxes the possession of cigarettes.  Petitioner Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online to residents of the City.  Neither state nor city law requires out-of-state sellers such as Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the Citys tax; instead, the City must recover its tax on out-of-state sales directly from the purchasers.  But the Jenkins Act, 15 U. S.C. 375378, requires out-of-state sellers to submit customer information to the States into which they ship cigarettes, and New York State has agreed to forward that information to the City.  That information helps the City track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes.  Against that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), alleging that Hemis failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the State constituted mail and wire fraud, which are defined as racketeering activit[ies], 18 U. S.C. 1961(1), subject to enforcement under civil RICO, 1964(c). The District Court dismissed the claims, but the Second Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded.  Among other things, the Court of Appeals held that the Citys asserted injurylost tax revenuecame about by reason of the predicate mail and wire frauds.  It accordingly determined that the City had stated a valid RICO claim.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
541 F.3d 425, reversed and remanded.
Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court in part, concluding that because the City cannot show that it lost tax revenue by reason of the alleged RICO violation, it cannot state a RICO claim.  Pp.515.


(a)To establish that an injury came about by reason of a RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that a predicate offense not only was a but for cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.  Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268. Proximate cause for RICO purposes should be evaluated in light of its common-law foundations; it thus requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.  Ibid.  A link that is too remote, purely contingent, or indirec[t] is insufficient.  Id., at 271, 274.  


The Citys causal theory cannot satisfy RICOs direct relationship requirement.  Indeed, the causal link here is far more attenuated than the one the Court rejected as purely contingent and too remote in Holmes.  Id., at 271.  According to the City, Hemi committed fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the required customer information to the State.  Without the reports from Hemi, the State could not pass on the information to the City, even if it had been so inclined.  Some of the customers legally obligated to pay the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so.  Because the City did not receive the customer information, it could not determine which customers had failed to pay the tax.  The City thus could not pursue those customers for payment.  The City thereby was injured in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.  As the Court reiterated in Holmes, [t]he general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step, id., at 271272, and that general tendency applies with full force to proximate cause inquiries under RICO, e.g., ibid.  Because the Citys causation theory requires the Court to move well beyond the first step, that theory cannot satisfy RICOs direct relationship requirement.  


The Citys claim suffers from the same defect as the RICO claim rejected in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 458461, where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the conduct giving rise to the fraud, see id., at 458.  Indeed, the disconnect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is even sharper.  In Anza, the same party had both engaged in the harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act.  Here, the Citys theory of liability rests not just on separate actions, but separate actions carried out by separate parties.  The Citys theory thus requires that the Court extend RICO liability to situations where the defendants fraud on the third party (the State) has made it easier for a fourth party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the City).  Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused harm to the City in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally obligated to pay.  Put simply, Hemis obligation was to file Jenkins Act reports with the State, not the City, and the Citys harm was directly caused by the customers, not Hemi. The Court has never before stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to do so today.  See, e.g., id., at 460461.  Pp.59.


(b)The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the violation not merely as Hemis failure to file Jenkins Act reports with the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the City of tax revenue.  But if the City could escape the proximate-cause requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Courts RICO proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule.  That precedent makes clear that the compensable injury flowing from a [RICO] violation  necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predicate acts.  Anza, supra, at 457.  Because the only fraudulent conduct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but cannot, show that Hemis failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led directly to its injuries.  


The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___.  There, the plaintiffs causation theory was straightforward:The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the plaintiffs injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there were the only parties injured by petitioners misrepresentations, id., at ___; and there were no independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury, id., at ___.  The Citys theory in this case is anything but straightforward:Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted injury.  And in contrast to Bridge, where there were no independent factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs] injury, id., at ___, here there certainly were:The Citys theory of liability rests on the independent actions of third and even fourth parties.  Pp.1014.

Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens and Kennedy, JJ., joined.

08-1569|"UNITED STATES v. OBRIEN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 081569.Argued February 23, 2010Decided May 24, 2010
Respondents OBrien and Burgess each carried a firearm during an attempted robbery.  Count three of their indictment charged them with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which carries a mandatory minimum 5-year prison term.  18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(A)(i).  Count four alleged use of a machinegun (here, a pistol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm) in furtherance of that crime, which carries a 30-year mandatory minimum term.  924(c)(1)(B)(ii).  The Government moved to dismiss the fourth count on the basis that it could not establish the count beyond a reasonable doubt, but it maintained that 924(c)(1)(B)(ii)s machinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined by the District Court upon a conviction on count three.  The court dismissed count four and rejected the Governments sentencing-enhancement position.  Respondents then pleaded guilty to the remaining counts.  The court sentenced OBrien to a 102-month term and Burgess to an 84-month term for their 924(c) convictions.  In affirming the District Courts 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) ruling, the First Circuit looked primarily to Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of 924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not a sentencing factor.  The court found that Castillo was close to binding, absent clearer or more dramatic changes than those made by Congress 1998 amendment of 924(c) or a clearer legislative history.
Held:The fact that a firearm was a machinegun is an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at sentencing.  Pp.516.
(a)Generally, a fact that increase[s] the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed is an element of a crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 9192.  Subject to this constitutional constraint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sentencing factor.  When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a statutes provisions and framework for guidance.  Analysis of the current machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court found the bare language of 924s prior version neutral, 530 U. S., at 124, but ruled that four factors(1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentencefavored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an offense, id., at 124131; while a fifth factorlegislative historydid not favor either side, ibid.  Pp.56.


(b)As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.  Thus, with regard to the first Castillo factor, the Courts observation that Congress placed the element uses or carries a firearm and the word machinegun in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections, 530 U. S., at 124125, no longer holds true.  However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Castillo factors.  Each of them, except for legislative history (which remains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun provision as an element.  The amendments effect on the language and structure factor requires closer examination.  Pp.612.


(c)Given the Courts determination in Castillo that the machinegun provision in 924s prior version is an element, a substantive change in the statute should not be inferred [a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in policy, Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290.  Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.  There are three principal differences between the previous and current 924(c).  The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum sentences.  The second, also substantivemade in direct response to the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that uses or carries in 924s preamendment version connotes more than mere possession, id., at 143adds possesses to the uses or carries language in 924(c)s principal paragraph and provides sentencing enhancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552556.  Neither of these substantive changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun provision from an element into a sentencing factor.  The third difference is the machinegun provisions relocation from the principal paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate subsection, 924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change provides no clear indication that Congress meant to alter its treatment of machineguns as an offense element.  A more logical explanation is that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute, which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines.  While this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentencing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124125, it has rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at 553.  The current structure of 924(c) is more favorable to treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now positioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and those in (C)(i) and (ii).  This structural point is overcome by the substantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear indication of its purpose to do so.  Pp.1216.
542 F. 3d 921, affirmed.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Scalia, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

S. 137, that uses or carries in 924s preamendment version connotes more than mere possession, id., at 143adds possesses to the uses or carries language in 924(c)s principal paragraph and provides sentencing enhancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552556.  Neither of these substantive changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun provision from an element into a sentencing factor.  The third difference is the machinegun provisions relocation from the principal paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate subsection, 924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change provides no clear indication that Congress meant to alter its treatment of machineguns as an offense element.  A more logical explanation is that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute, which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines.  While this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentencing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124125, it has rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at 553.  The current structure of 924(c) is more favorable to treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now positioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and those in (C)(i) and (ii).  This structural point is overcome by the substantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear indication of its purpose to do so.

08-911|"KUCANA v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 08911.Argued November 10, 2009Decided January 20, 2010
The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or Act), codifying certain rules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney General, that govern the process of reopening removal proceedings.  IIRIRA also added a provision stating that no court has jurisdiction to review any action of the Attorney General the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.  8 U. S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  A regulation, amended just months before IIRIRAs enactment, provides that [t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen  is within the discretion of the [Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)], 8 CFR 1003.2(a).  As adjudicator in immigration cases, the BIA exercises authority delegated by the Attorney General.


Petitioner Kucana moved to reopen his removal proceedings, asserting new evidence in support of his plea for asylum.  An Immigration Judge denied the motion, and the BIA sustained that ruling.  The Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the administrative determination, holding that 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars judicial review not only of administrative decisions made discretionary by statute, but also of those made discretionary by regulation.
Held:Section 1252(a)(2)(B)s proscription of judicial review applies only to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute, not to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation.  Pp.618.
(a)The motion to reopen is an important safeguard intended to ensure a proper and lawful disposition of immigration proceedings.  Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___.  Federal-court review of administrative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review.  While the Attorney Generals regulation in point, 8 CFR 1003.2(a), places the reopening decision within the BIAs discretion, the statute does not codify that prescription or otherwise specif[y] that such decisions are in the Attorney Generals discretion.  Pp.67.


(b)Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.  Pp.816.


(1)The amicus defending the Seventh Circuits judgment urges that regulations suffice to trigger 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)s proscription.  She comprehends under in authority  specified under this subchapter to mean, e.g., pursuant to, subordinate to.  Administrative regulations count for 1252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, because they are issued pursuant to, and are measures subordinate to, the legislation they serve to implement.  On that reading, 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an executive regulation places within the BIAs discretion, including the decision to deny a motion to reopen.  The parties, on the other hand, read the statutory language to mean specified in, or specified by, the subchapter.  On their reading, 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary character of the Attorney Generals authority.  Pp.89.


(2)The word under has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context.  Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135.  Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the parties position stands on firmer ground.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far from IIRIRAs only jurisdictional limitation.  It is sandwiched between two subsections, 1252(a)(2)(A) and 1252(a)(2)(C), both dependent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their scope.  Given 1252(a)(2)(B)s statutory placement, one would expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.  Pp.911.


(3)Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review category any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.  Each of the referenced statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is entrusted to the Attorney Generals discretion.  Clause (i) does not refer to any regulatory provision.  The proximity of clause (i) and the clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking themany other decisionsuggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation.  Read harmoniously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney Generals discretionary authority in the statute.  Pp.1112.


(4)Also significant is the character of the decisions insulated from judicial review in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).  The listed determinations are substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or not aliens can stay in the country.  Other decisions specified by statute to be in the discretion of the Attorney General, and therefore shielded from court oversight by 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.  See, e.g., 1157(c)(1).  Decisions on reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings.  A court decision reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and concerns only the question whether the aliens claims have been accorded a reasonable hearing.  Had Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regulation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have said so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  See, e.g., IIRIRA, 213, 110 Stat. 3009572.  Pp.1214.


(5)The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates this determination.  Attorney General regulations have long addressed reopening requests.  In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simultaneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding removal.  But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the BIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions.  This legislative silence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General, to grant or deny a motion to reopen, 8 CFR 1003.2(a), but courts retain jurisdiction to review the BIAs decision.  It is unsurprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this important [procedural] safeguard, Dada, 554 U. S., at ___, where, as here, the aliens underlying asylum claim would itself be reviewable.  The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by adding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from removal, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of decisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions to reopen.  Pp.1416.


(c)Any lingering doubt about 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)s proper interpretation would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle: the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.  When a statute is reasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation, this Court adopts the reading that executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.  Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434.  The Court has consistently applied this interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and particularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 6364.  Because this presumption is well-settled, ibid., the Court assumes that Congress legislates with knowledge of it, McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496.  It therefore takes clear and convincing evidence to dislodge the presumption.  Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64.  There is no such evidence here.  Finally, reading 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would ignore Congress design to retain for itself control over federal-court jurisdiction.  The Seventh Circuits construction would free the Executive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions discretionary.  Such an extraordinary delegation of authority cannot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.  Pp.1617.
533 F.3d 534, reversed and remanded.

09-5270|"ERIC PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of georgia
No. 095270.Decided January 19, 2010
Per Curiam.

After a jury trial in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley was convicted of a cocaine trafficking offense.  The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia.  285 Ga. 270, 674 S.E. 2d 909 (2009).  Presley seeks certiorari, claiming his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a public trial was violated when the trial court excluded the public from the voir dire of prospective jurors.  The Supreme Court of Georgias affirmance contravened this Courts clear precedents.  Certiorari and petitioners motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are now granted, and the judgment is reversed.


Before selecting a jury in Presleys trial, the trial court noticed a lone courtroom observer.  Id., at 270271, 674 S.E. 2d, at 910.  The court explained that prospective jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that he was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that floor of the courthouse entirely.  Id., at 271, 674 S.E. 2d, at 910.  The court then questioned the man and learned
he was Presleys uncle.  Ibid.  The court reiterated its instruction:
Well, you still cant sit out in the audience with the jurors.  You know, most of the afternoon actually were going to be picking a jury.  And we may have a couple of pre-trial matters, so youre welcome to come in after we  complete selecting the jury this afternoon.  But, otherwise, you would have to leave the sixth floor, because jurors will be all out in the hallway in a few moments.  That applies to everybody whos got a case.  Ibid. 

Presleys counsel objected to the exclusion of the public from the courtroom, but the court explained, [t]here just isnt space for them to sit in the audience.  Ibid.  When Presleys counsel requested some accommodation, the court explained its ruling further:
Well, the uncle can certainly come back in once the trial starts.  Theres no, really no need for the uncle to be present during jury selection. [W]e have 42 jurors coming up.  Each of those rows will be occupied by jurors.  And his uncle cannot sit and intermingle with members of the jury panel.  But, when the trial starts, the opening statements and other matters, he can certainly come back into the courtroom.  Ibid. 

After Presley was convicted, he moved for a new trial based on the exclusion of the public from the juror voir dire.  At a hearing on the motion, Presley presented evidence showing that 14 prospective jurors could have fit in the jury box and the remaining 28 could have fit entirely on one side of the courtroom, leaving adequate room for the public.  App. to Pet. for Cert. E37, E41.  The trial court denied the motion, commenting that it preferred to seat jurors throughout the entirety of the courtroom, and its up to the individual judge to decide . . . whats comfortable.  Id., E38.  The court continued: Its totally up to my discretion whether or not I want family members in the courtroom to intermingle with the jurors and sit directly behind the jurors where they might overhear some inadvertent comment or conversation.  Id., at E42 to E43.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Georgia agreed, finding [t]here was no abuse of discretion here, when the trial court explained the need to exclude spectators at the voir dire stage of the proceedings and when members of the public were invited to return afterward.  290 Ga. App. 99, 100101, 658 S.E. 2d 773, 775 (2008).  


The Supreme Court of Georgia granted certiorari and affirmed, with two justices dissenting.  After finding the trial court certainly had an overriding interest in ensuring that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial remarks from observers during voir dire, the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected Presleys argument that the trial court was required to consider alternatives to closing the courtroom.  285 Ga., at 272, 273, 674 S.E. 2d, at 911.  It noted that the United States Supreme Court [has] not provide[d] clear guidance regarding whether a court must, sU. S.onte, advance its own alternatives to [closure], and the court ruled that Presley was obliged to present the court with any alternatives that he wished the court to consider.  Id., at 273, 674 S.E. 2d, at 911, 912.  When no alternatives are offered, it concluded, there is no abuse of discretion in the courts failure to sU. S.onte advance its own alternatives.  Id., at 274, 674 S.E. 2d, at 912.  


This Courts rulings with respect to the public trial right rest upon two different provisions of the Bill of Rights, both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Sixth Amendment directs, in relevant part, that [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial .  The Court in Inre Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273 (1948), made it clear that this right extends to the States.  The Sixth Amendment right, as the quoted language makes explicit, is the right of the accused.  


The Court has further held that the public trial right extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the First Amendment.  Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501 (1984) (Press-Enterprise I).  This requirement, too, is binding on the States.  Ibid. 


The case now before the Court is brought under the Sixth Amendment, for it is the accused who invoked his right to a public trial.  An initial question is whether the right to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury selection phase of trial, and in particular the voir dire of prospective jurors.  In the First Amendment context that question was answered in Press-Enterprise I.  Id., at 510.  The Court there held that the voir dire of prospective jurors must be open to the public under the First Amendment.  Later in the same Term as Press-Enterprise I, the Court considered a Sixth Amendment case concerning whether the public trial right extends to a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress certain evidence.  Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984).  The Waller Court relied heavily upon Press-Enterprise I in finding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends beyond the actual proof at trial.  It ruled that the pretrial suppression hearing must be open to the public because there can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.  467 U. S., at 46.  


While Press-Enterprise I was heavily relied upon in Waller, the jury selection issue in the former case was resolved under the First, not the Sixth, Amendment.  Press-Enterprise I, supra, at 516 (Stevens, J., concurring) (The constitutional protection for the right of access that the Court upholds today is found in the First Amendment, rather than the public trial provision of the Sixth (footnote omitted)).  In the instant case, the question then arises whether it is so well settled that the Sixth Amendment right extends to jury voir dire that this Court may proceed by summary disposition.


The point is well settled under Press-Enterprise I and Waller.  The extent to which the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive is an open question, and it is not necessary here to speculate whether or in what circumstances the reach or protections of one might be greater than the other.  Still, there is no legitimate reason, at least in the context of juror selection proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings than the accused has.  Our cases have uniformly recognized the public-trial guarantee as one created for the benefit of the defendant.  Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U. S. 368, 380 (1979).  There could be no explanation for barring the accused from raising a constitutional right that is unmistakably for his or her benefit.  That rationale suffices to resolve the instant matter.  The Supreme Court of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to the voir dire of prospective jurors.


While the accused does have a right to insist that the voir dire of the jurors be public, there are exceptions to this general rule.  [T]he right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the defendants right to a fair trial or the governments interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.  Waller, 467 U. S., at 45.  Such circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.  Ibid.  Waller provided standards for courts to apply before excluding the public from any stage of a criminal trial: 
[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.  Id., at 48.

In upholding exclusion of the public at juror voir dire in the instant case, the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded, despite our explicit statements to the contrary, that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an opposing partys proffer of some alternatives.  While the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open question under this Courts precedents, the statement in Waller that the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding settles the point.  Ibid.  If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the Court was more explicit in Press-Enterprise I: 
Even with findings adequate to support closure, the trial courts orders denying access to voir dire testimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial courts orders sought to guard.  Absent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally close the voir dire.  464 U. S., at 511.  

The conclusion that trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties is clear not only from this Courts precedents but also from the premise that [t]he process of juror selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the adversaries but to the criminal justice system.  Id., at 505.  The public has a right to be present whether or not any party has asserted the right.  In Press-Enterprise I, for instance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution requested an open courtroom during juror voir dire proceedings; in fact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping the transcript of the proceedings confidential.  Id., at 503504.  The Court, nonetheless, found it was error to close the courtroom.  Id., at 513.  


Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court could not have accommodated the public at Presleys trial.  Without knowing the precise circumstances, some possibilities include reserving one or more rows for the public; dividing the jury venire panel to reduce courtroom congestion; or instructing prospective jurors not to engage or interact with audience members.  


Petitioner also argues that, apart from failing to consider alternatives to closure, the trial court erred because it did not even identify any overriding interest likely to be prejudiced absent the closure of voir dire.  There is some merit to this complaint.  The generic risk of jurors overhearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are present during the selection of jurors.  If broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendants constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course.  As noted in the dissent below, the majoritys reasoning permits the closure of voir dire in every criminal case conducted in this courtroom whenever the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or she would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors rather than spectators.  285 Ga., at 276, 674 S.E. 2d, at 913 (opinion of Sears, C.J.).


There are no doubt circumstances where a judge could conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closing voir dire.  But in those cases, the particular interest, and threat to that interest, must be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.  Press-Enterprise I, supra, at 510; see also Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside, 478 U. S. 1, 15 (1986) (The First Amendment right of access cannot be overcome by the conclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of [the right to a fair trial]).  


We need not rule on this second claim of error, because even assuming, arguendo, that the trial court had an overriding interest in closing voir dire, it was still incumbent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives to closure.  It did not, and that is all this Court needs to decide. 


The Supreme Court of Georgias judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.     
It is so ordered.

09-5731|"MARCUS A. WELLONS v. HILTON HALL, WARDEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 095731.Decided January 19, 2010
Per Curiam.

From beginning to end, judicial proceedings conducted for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect. The disturbing facts of this case raise serious questions concerning the conduct of the trial, and this petition raises a serious question about whether the Court of Appeals carefully reviewed those facts before addressing petitioners constitutional claims.  We know that the Court of Appeals committed the same procedural error that we corrected in Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1718).  We do not know how the court would have ruled if it had the benefit of our decision in that case.


Petitioner Marcus Wellons was convicted in Georgia state court of rape and murder and sentenced to death.  Although the trial looked typical, there were unusual events going on behind the scenes.  Only after the trial did defense counsel learn that there had been unreported ex parte contacts between the jury and the judge, that jurors and a bailiff had planned a reunion, and that either during or immediately following the penalty phase, some jury members gave the trial judge chocolate shaped as male genitalia and the bailiff chocolate shaped as female breasts, 554 F.3d 923, 930 (CA11 2009).  The judge had not reported any of this to the defense.


Neither Wellons nor any court has ascertained exactly what went on at this capital trial or what prompted such gifts.  Wellons has repeatedly tried, in both state and federal court, to find out what occurred, but he has found himself caught in a procedural morass: He raised the issue on direct appeal but was constrained by the nonexistent record, and the State Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence.  Wellons v. State, 266 Ga. 77, 88, 463 S.E. 2d 868, 880 (1995).  He sought state habeas relief and moved to develop evidence.  But the court held that the matter had been decided on appeal and thus was res judicata.  See 554 F.3d, at 932.  He raised the issue again in his federal habeas petition, seeking discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  But the District Court concluded that Wellons claims  were procedurally barred, and accordingly denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing on these claims.  Id., at 933.[Footnote 1]  Before the Eleventh Circuit, Wellons argue[d] that the district court erred in denying his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing to develop his judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct claims because they are not procedurally barred.  Id., at 935.  The court disagreed, holding that Wellons claims were procedurally barred.  Ibid.


As our dissenting colleagues acknowledge, post, at 1 (opinion of Scalia, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of Alito, J.), the Eleventh Circuits holding was an error under Cone, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1718).  When a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioners claim on the ground that it has done so already, it creates no bar to federal habeas review.  Id., at __ (slip op., at 17).  Both dissenting opinions assume that the issue on which Cone throws light does not affect the outcome because the Eleventh Circuit  also decided that petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits.  Post, at 12 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Having found a procedural bar, however, the Eleventh Circuit had no need to address whether petitioner was otherwise entitled to an evidentiary hearing and gave this question, at most, perfunctory consideration that may well have turned on the District Courts finding of a procedural bar.


Although Wellons appealed the denial of his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, 554 F. 3d, at 935, the Eleventh Circuit did not purport to address the merits of that issue at all.[Footnote 2]  The court stated only that [e]ven if we assume that Wellonss misconduct claims are not procedurally barred, they do not entitle Wellons to habeas relief.  Id., at 936 (emphasis added).  This opaque statement appears to address only whether petitioner was entitled to ultimate relief in the form of a new trial, not whether petitioners allegations, combined with the facts he had learned, entitled him to the discovery and evidentiary hearing that he sought.


The Eleventh Circuits reasoning does not suggest otherwise.  The court observed that Wellons claims of misconduct were grounded in his speculation as to the meaning underlying the jurors chocolate gifts and the surmise attached to their passive receipt of these gifts.  Ibid.  This statement likewise indicates only that on the existing record, habeas relief was inappropriate, not that an evidentiary hearing should be denied.  After all, had there been discovery or an evidentiary hearing, Wellons may have been able to present more than speculation and surmise.  The Eleventh Circuit also pointed to the state courts decision on direct appeal, see id., at 937, and reviewed that decision [i]n light of the evidence presented before the Georgia Supreme Court, ibid.  This, too, is typical of a court reviewing the denial of habeas relief, not the denial of discovery or an evidentiary hearing. [Footnote 3]


Moreover, even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit intended to address Wellons motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, we cannot be sure that its reasoning really was independent of the Cone error.  The fact that his claims rested on speculation and surmise was due to the absence of a record, which was in part based on the Cone error.  And as the Eleventh Circuits reasoning turned on the evidence presented before the Georgia Supreme Court, 554 F.3d, at 937, there is serious doubt about whether it necessarily relied on the very holes in the record that Wellons was trying to fill.  


Our dissenting colleagues allege that the Court is degrad[ing]  our traditional requirements for a GVR.  Post, at 2 (opinion of  Scalia, J.); see post, at 4 (opinion of Alito, J.).  But the standard for an order granting certiorari, vacating the judgment below, and remanding the case (GVR) remains as it always has been: A GVR is appropriate when intervening developments  reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the matter.  Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam).  As already discussed, there is, at least, a reasonable probability, ibid., that the denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing rested in part on the Cone error.  And in light of the unusual facts of the case, a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome, 516 U. S., at 167; cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 442 (2000) (holding that several omissions as a whole disclose the need for an evidentiary hearing); Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 215 (1982) (This Court has long held that the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has an opportunity to prove actual bias).  The Eleventh Circuits opinion is ambiguous in significant respects.  It would be highly inappropriate to assume away that ambiguity in respondents favor.  That is especially so in a case in which petitioners allegations and the unusual facts raise a serious question about the fairness of a capital trial.    


Both dissenting opinions suggest that if there is a strong case for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, then the Court should summarily reverse or set the case for argument.  Post, at 2 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also post, at 45 (opinion of Alito, J.).  But as we have explained, a GVR order conserves the scarce resources of this Court, assists the court below by flagging a particular issue that it does not appear to have fully considered, and assists this Court by procuring the benefit of the lower courts insight before we rule on the merits.  Lawrence, supra, at 167.        


Unlike Justice Scalia, post, at 3, we do not believe that a self-respecting court of appeals would or should respond to our remand order with a summary reissuance of essentially the same opinion, absent the procedural default discussion.  To the contrary, in light of our decision in Cone, we assume the court will consider, on the merits, whether petitioners allegations, together with the undisputed facts, warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  


The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Eleventh Circuit for further consideration in light of Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1718).
Although the District Court found most of petitioners claims to be procedurally barred, it alternatively declined to permit an evidentiary hearing because Wellons did not have enough evidence of bias or misconduct.  Justice Alito wrongly suggests that the District Court reached that conclusion by reviewing a proffer that Wellons attorneys assembled by contacting all but 1 of the jurors, many of whom spoke freely.  Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion).  Even apart from the fact that these interviews were informal and unsworn, they shed almost no light on what had occurred.  The juror who allegedly gave the penis to the judge, App. C to Pet. for Cert. 36, was hostile and refused to talk, id., at 37; one refused to talk about the trial, id., at 36; another did not want to talk about the case, id., at 37; and one conferr[ed] with his wife who then slammed and bolted the door, ibid.  Of those jurors who were willing to talk at all, one admitted to being concerned that she might say something that would be used for a mistrial, id., at 35, and none admitted to knowing how or why the jury selected its gifts, see id., at 3536, 37.  (Implausibly, Justice Alito suggests that Wellons lawyers may not have asked how or why the jury selected its gifts, post, at 3, though he bases that speculation only on the fact that no questions appeared in the proffer of facts.)  Rather, the jurors discussed other matters and did so in the briefest of terms.  All told, everything that Petitioner  learned, App. C to Pet. for Cert. 38, filled only a few sheets of paper, see id., at 3536, 37.  


Moreover, the subjects that the jurors did discuss may very well support Wellons view that his trial was tainted by bias or misconduct.  For example, one interviewee was surprised that a fellow juror had been allowed to serve on a capital trial, given that her sister had been murdered by a man after he completed serving a life sentence.  Id., at 36.  
As Justice Alito explains at some length, see post, at 24, the District Court did discuss the merits of that issue, but the District Courts analysis has little relevance on whether the Court of Appeals made an alternative holding or rather affirmed the District Courts decision on the ground that petitioners claim was procedurally barred.
Justice Alito asserts that the Eleventh Circuit stated in unequivocal terms that its holding on the merits of petitioners claim was independent of its holding on the question of procedural default.  Post, at 1.  But that does not address the question: The merits of what?  The question whether to grant habeas relief or whether to permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing?


Contrary to our dissenting colleagues, post, at 4 (opinion of Alito, J.), we do not find it dispositive that the section of the Eleventh Circuits opinion about judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct began with a full page statement of the standard of review, which in turn included a sentence about the circumstances under which an evidentiary hearing is warranted.  See 554 F.3d, at 934935.  Immediately following the standard of review that Justice Alito quotes, the panel explained that if the record  precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing, and that the record reveals that [Wellons] claims  are procedurally barred.  Id., at 935.


Moreover, the allegedly unequivocal holding that Justice Alito quotes was preceded by a discussion of the deference owed under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) to the Georgia Supreme Courts judgment as to the substance and effect of the ex parte communication. Id., at 937.  This is the classic formulation of a decision of whether to grant habeas relief.  Indeed, it would be bizarre if a federal court had to defer to state-court factual findings, made without any evidentiary record, in order to decide whether it could create an evidentiary record to decide whether the factual findings were erroneous.  If that were the case, then almost no habeas petitioner could ever get an evidentiary hearing: So long as the state court found a fact that the petitioner was trying to disprove through the presentation of evidence, then there could be no hearing.  AEDPA does not require such a crabbed and illogical approach to habeas procedures, and there is no reason to believe that the Eleventh Circuit thought otherwise.

09-648|"DENNIS HOLLINGSWORTH et al. v. KRISTIN M. PERRY et al.
on application for stay
[January 13, 2010]
Per Curiam.

We are asked to stay the broadcast of a federal trial.  We resolve that question without expressing any view on whether such trials should be broadcast.  We instead determine that the broadcast in this case should be stayed because it appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting.  Courts enforce the requirement of procedural regularity on others, and must follow those requirements themselves.

This lawsuit, still in a preliminary stage, involves an action challenging what the parties refer to as Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition adopted by the electorate.  Proposition 8 amended the State Constitution by adding a new section providing that [o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.  Cal. Const. Art. I, 7.5.  The plaintiffs contend that Proposition 8 violates the United States Constitution.  A bench trial in the case began on Monday, January 11, 2010, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
The District Court has issued an order permitting the trial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to a number of federal courthouses around the country.  The order was issued pursuant to a purported amendment to a local Rule of the District Court.  That Rule had previously forbidden the broadcasting of trials outside the courthouse in which a trial takes place.  The District Court effected its amendment via several postings on the District Courts Web site in the days immediately before the trial in this case was to begin.  


Applicants here are defendant-intervenors in the lawsuit.  They object to the District Courts order, arguing that the District Court violated a federal statute by promulgating the amendment to its local Rule without sufficient opportunity for notice and comment and that the public broadcast would violate their due process rights to a fair and impartial trial.  Applicants seek a stay of the order pending the filing of petitions for writs of certiorari and mandamus.  We granted a temporary stay to consider the issue further.  Post, p. ___.  Concluding that the applicants have made a sufficient showing of entitlement to relief, we now grant a stay.
I

Proposition 8 was passed by California voters in November 2008.  It was a ballot proposition designed to overturn a ruling by the California Supreme Court that had given same-sex couples a right to marry.  Proposition 8 was and is the subject of public debate throughout the State and, indeed, nationwide.  Its advocates claim that they have been subject to harassment as a result of public disclosure of their support.  See, e.g., Reply Brief for Appellant 2829 in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, No. 08205, now pending before this Court.  For example, donors to groups supporting Proposition 8 have received death threats and envelopes containing a powdery white substance.  Stone, Prop 8 Donor Web Site Shows Disclosure is a 2-Edged Sword, N.Y. Times, Feb. 8, 2009.  Some advocates claim that they have received confrontational phone calls and e-mail messages from opponents of Proposition 8, ibid., and others have been forced to resign their jobs after it became public that they had donated to groups supporting the amendment, see Brief for Center for Competitive Politics as Amicus Curiae 1314, in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, No. 08205, now pending before this Court.  Opponents of Proposition 8 also are alleged to have compiled Internet blacklists of pro-Proposition 8 businesses and urged others to boycott those businesses in retaliation for supporting the ballot measure.  Carlton, Gay Activists Boycott Backers of Prop 8, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 27, 2008, A3.  And numerous instances of vandalism and physical violence have been reported against those who have been identified as Proposition 8 supporters.  See Exhs. B, I, and L to Defendant-Intervenors Motion for Protective Order in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, No. 3:09cv02292 (ND Cal.) (hereinafter Defendant-Intervenors Motion).
Respondents filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking to invalidate Proposition 8.  They contend that the amendment to the States Constitution violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The State of California declined to defend Proposition 8, and the defendant-intervenors (who are the applicants here) entered the suit to defend its constitutionality.  A bench trial began on Monday, January 11, 2010, before the Chief Judge of the District Court, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker.


On September 25, 2009, the District Court informed the parties at a hearing that there was interest in the possibility that the trial would be broadcast.  Respondents indicated their support for the idea, while applicants opposed it.  The court noted that [t]here are, of course, Judicial Conference positions on this, but also that [t]his is all in flux.  Exh. 9, p. 72, App. to Pet. for Mandamus in No. 1070063 (CA9) (hereinafter App. to Pet.).


One month later, Chief Judge Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appointed a three-judge committee to evaluate the possibility of adopting a Ninth Circuit Rule regarding the recording and transmission of district court proceedings.  The committee (of which Chief Judge Walker was a member) recommended to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council that district courts be permitted to experiment with broadcasting court proceedings on a trial basis.  Chief Judge Walker later acknowledged that while the committee was considering the pilot program, this case was very much in mind at that time because it had come to prominence then and was thought to be an ideal candidate for consideration.  Id., Exh. 2, at 42.  The committee did not publicly disclose its consideration of the proposal, nor did it solicit or receive public comments on the proposal.


On December 17, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued a news release indicating that it had approved a pilot program for the limited use of cameras in federal district courts within the circuit.  Id., Exh. 13, at1.  The release explained that the Councils decision amend[ed] a 1996 Ninth Circuit policy that had banned the photographing, as well as radio and television coverage, of court proceedings.  Ibid.  The release further indicated that cases would be selected for participation in the program by the chief judge of the district court in consultation with the chief circuit judge.  Ibid.  No further guidelines for participation in the pilot program have since been issued.


On December 21, a coalition of media companies requested permission from the District Court to televise the trial challenging Proposition 8.  Two days later, the court indicated on its Web site that it had amended Civil Local Rule 773, which had previously banned the recording or broadcast of court proceedings.  The revised version of Rule 773 created an exception to this general prohibition to allow for participation in a pilot or other project authorized by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.  Id., Exh. 14.  Applicants objected to the revision, arguing that any change to Ninth Circuit or local rules would require a sufficient notice and comment period.


On December 31, the District Court revised its Web site to remove the previous announcement about the change to Rule 773.  A new announcement was posted indicating a proposed revision of Civil Local Rule 773, which had been approved for public comment.  Id., Exh. 17.  The proposed revision was the same as the previously announced amendment.  Comments on the proposed revision were to be submitted by Friday, January 8, 2010. 


On January 4, 2010, the District Court again revised its Web site.  The announcement regarding the proposed revision of Rule 773 was removed and replaced with a third version of the announcement.  This third version stated that the revised Rule was effective December 22, 2009, and that [t]he revised rule was adopted pursuant to the immediate need provision of Title 28 Section 2071(e).  Id., Exh. 19, at3.


On January 6, 2010, the District Court held a hearing regarding the recording and broadcasting of the upcoming trial.  The court announced that an audio and video feed of trial proceedings would be streamed live to certain courthouses in other cities.  It also announced that, pending approval of the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, the trial would be recorded and then broadcast on the Internet.  A court technician explained that the proceedings would be recorded by three cameras, and then the resulting broadcast would be uploaded for posting on the Internet, with a delay due to processing requirements.


On January 7, 2010, the District Court filed an order formally requesting that Chief Judge Kozinski approve inclusion of the trial in the pilot project on the terms and conditions discussed at the January 6, 2010, hearing and subject to resolution of certain technical issues.  Id., Exh. 1, at 2.  Applicants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals, seeking to prohibit or stay the District Court from enforcing its order.  The following day, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals denied the petition.


On January 8, 2010, Chief Judge Kozinski issued an order approving the District Courts decision to allow real-time streaming of the trial to certain federal courthouses listed in a simultaneously issued press release.  Five locations had been selected: federal courthouses in San Francisco, Pasadena, Seattle, Portland, and Brooklyn.  The press release also indicated that [a]dditional sites may be announced.  Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote Viewing of Proposition 8 Trial, online at http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/Prop8_Remote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2010, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file).


Chief Judge Kozinskis January 8 order noted that the request to broadcast the trial on the Internet was still pending before him.  In a later letter to Chief Judge Walker, he explained that the request was not yet ripe for approval because the technical staff encountered some unexpected difficulties preparing a satisfactory video suitable for on-line posting.  Letter of Jan. 9, 2010 (available in Clerk of Courts case file).  A final decision whether to permit online publication would be made when technical difficulties were resolved.


On January 9, 2010, applicants filed in this Court an application for a stay of the District Courts order.  Their petition seeks a stay pending resolution of forthcoming petitions for the writs of certiorari and mandamus.
II

The question whether courtroom proceedings should be broadcast has prompted considerable national debate.  Reasonable minds differ on the proper resolution of that debate and on the restrictions, circumstances, and procedures under which such broadcasts should occur.  We do not here express any views on the propriety of broadcasting court proceedings generally.  


Instead, our review is confined to a narrow legal issue: whether the District Courts amendment of its local rules to broadcast this trial complied with federal law.  We conclude that it likely did not and that applicants have demonstrated that irreparable harm would likely result from the District Courts actions.  We therefore stay the courts January 7, 2010, order to the extent that it permits the live streaming of court proceedings to other federal courthouses.  We do not address other aspects of that order, such as those related to the broadcast of court proceedings on the Internet, as this may be premature.
A

To obtain a stay pending the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, an applicant must show (1)a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay.  In close cases the Circuit Justice or the Court will balance the equities and weigh the relative harms to the applicant and to the respondent.  Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (Kennedy, J., in chambers); Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in chambers).  To obtain a stay pending the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of mandamus, an applicant must show a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to grant mandamus and a likelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay.  Before a writ of mandamus may issue, a party must establish that (1) no other adequate means [exist] to attain the relief he desires, (2) the partys right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.  Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U. S. 367, 380381 (2004) (some internal quotation marks omitted).    This Court will issue the writ of mandamus directly to a federal district court only where a question of public importance is involved, or where the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly appropriate that such action by this court should be taken.  Ex parte United States, 287 U. S. 241, 248249 (1932).  These familiar standards are followed here, where applicants claim that the District Courts order was based on a local rule adopted in violation of federal law.
B

Given the importance of the issues at stake, and our conclusion that the District Court likely violated a federal statute in revising its local rules, applicants have shown a fair prospect that a majority of this Court will either grant a petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the order below or will grant a petition for a writ of mandamus.
A district court has discretion to adopt local rules.  Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, 645 (1987) (citing 28  U. S.C. 2071; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83).  Those rules have the force of law.  Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 169 (1929).  Federal law, however, requires a district court to follow certain procedures to adopt or amend a local rule.  Local rules typically may not be amended unless the district court giv[es] appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment.  28 U. S.C. 2071(b); see also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83(a).  A limited exception permits dispensing with this notice-and-comment requirement only where there is an immediate need for a rule.  2071(e).  Even where a rule is amended based on immediate need, however, the issuing court must promptly thereafter afford  notice and opportunity for comment.  Ibid. 


Before late December, the courts Local Rule 773 explicitly banned the broadcast of court proceedings:
Unless allowed by a Judge or a Magistrate Judge with respect to his or her own chambers or assigned courtroom for ceremonial purposes, the taking of photographs, public broadcasting or televising, or recording for those purposes in the courtroom or its environs, in connection with any judicial proceeding, is prohibited.  Electronic transmittal of courtroom proceedings and presentation of evidence within the confines of the courthouse is permitted, if authorized by the Judge or Magistrate Judge.  The term environs, as used in this rule, means all floors on which chambers, courtrooms or on which Offices of the Clerk are located, with the exception of any space specifically designated as a Press Room.  Nothing in this rule is intended to restrict the use of electronic means to receive or present evidence during Court proceedings.

Notably, the Rule excepted from its general ban the transmittal of certain proceedingsbut it limited that exception to transmissions within the confines of the courthouse.  The negative inference of this exception, of course, is that the Rule would have prohibited the streaming of transmissions, or other broadcasting or televising, beyond the confines of the courthouse. 


Respondents do not dispute that this version of Rule 773 would have prohibited streaming video of the trial around the country.  But they assert that this is not the operative version of Rule 773.  In a series of postings on its Web site, the District Court purported to revise or propose revisions to Local Rule 773.  This amendment would have created an additional exception to Rule 773s general ban on the broadcasting of court proceedings for participation in a pilot or other project authorized by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.  Exh. 14, App. to Pet.  Respondents rely on this amended version of the Rule.


The amended version of Rule 773 appears to be invalid.  In amending this rule, it appears that the District Court failed to giv[e] appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment, as required by federal law.  28 U. S.C. 2071(b).  The first time the District Court asked for public comments was on the afternoon of New Years Eve.  The court stated that it would leave the comment period open until January 8.  At most, the District Court therefore allowed a comment period spanning five business days.  There is substantial merit to the argument that this was not appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment.  Administrative agencies, for instance, usually provide a comment period of thirty days or more.  Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F.2d 1479, 1484 (CA9 1992); see Petry v. Block, 737 F.2d 1193, 1201 (CADC 1984) ([T]he shortest period in which parties can meaningfully review a proposed rule and file informed responses is thirty days).


To be sure, the possibility that some aspects of the trial might be broadcast was first raised to the parties by the District Court at an in-court hearing on September 25, some three months before the Rule was changed.  The broadcasting, however, was prohibited under both Circuit and local rules at that time.  The first public indication that the District Court intended to adopt a rule of general applicability came in its Web site posting on December 23.  And even if Chief Judge Walkers in-court allusion to the possibility that the Proposition 8 trial might be broadcast could be considered as providing notice to the parties in this casehis statement that [t]his is all in flux notwithstandingthe disclosure falls far short of the appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment required by 2071(b).  Indeed, there was no proposed policy on which to comment.


The need for a meaningful comment period was particularly acute in this case.  Both courts and legislatures have proceeded with appropriate caution in addressing this question.  In 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United States adopted a policy opposing the public broadcast of court proceedings.  This policy was adopted after a multiyear study of the issue by the Federal Judicial Center which drew on data from six district and two appellate courts, as well as state-court data.  In light of the studys findings, the Judicial Conference concluded that the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors [is] cause for concern.  Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States 47 (Sept. 20, 1994).


In more than a decade since its adoption the Judicial Conference has continued to adhere to its position on the broadcast of court proceedings.  While the policy conclusions of the Judicial Conference may not be binding on the lower courts, they are at the very least entitled to respectful consideration.  Inre Sony BMG Music Entertainment, 564 F.3d 1, 6 (CA1 2009).  Before abandoning its own policyone consistent with the Judicial Conferences longstanding viewsit was incumbent on the District Court to adopt a proposed rule only after notice and an adequate period for public comment.


In dispensing with public notice and comment the District Court invoked the immediate need exception.  28 U. S.C. 2071(e).  It did so through a Web site posting on January 4prior to the expiration of the comment periodindicating that Rule 773 had been revised to permit participation in the Ninth Circuits pilot program.  These postings gave no explanation for invoking the exception.  At trial the District Court explained that the immediate need here was to allow this case to be broadcast pursuant to the Ninth Circuits new pilot program.  See Exh. 1, p.11, Supp. App. to Response for Perry etal.


This does not qualify as an immediate need that justifies dispensing with the notice and comment procedures required by federal law.  While respondents (the plaintiffs in the District Court) had indicated their approval of the plan, no party alleged that it would be imminently harmed if the trial were not broadcast.  Had an administrative agency acted as the District Court did here, the immediate need exception would likely not have been available.  See 5 U. S.C. 553(b)(B) (administrative agencies cannot invoke an exception to affording notice-and-comment before rulemaking unless the notice-and-comment procedures would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest). In issuing its order the District Court relied on the Ninth Circuit Judicial Councils pilot program.  Yet nothing in that programwhich was not adopted after notice and comment procedures, cf. 28 U. S.C. 332(d)(1)required any immediate revision in local rules.  The Ninth Circuit Judicial Council did not purport to modify or abrogate the District Courts local Rule.  Nor could it, as the Judicial Council only has the power to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with federal law.  See 332(d)(4) (permitting a circuit court council to modify a local rule that is found inconsistent with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court).  No federal law requires that the District Court broadcast some of its cases.  The District Courts local Rule, in addition, was not a conforming amendment to Ninth Circuit policy, because that policy does not require district courts to broadcast proceedings.


Applicants also have shown that irreparable harm will likely result from the denial of the stay.  Without a stay, the District Court will broadcast the trial.  It would be difficultif not impossibleto reverse the harm from those broadcasts.  The trial will involve various witnesses, including members of same-sex couples; academics, who apparently will discuss gender issues and gender equality, as well as family structures; and those who participated in the campaign leading to the adoption of Proposition 8.  This Court has recognized that witness testimony may be chilled if broadcast.  See Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 547 (1965); id., at 591 (Harlan, J., concurring).  Some of applicants witnesses have already said that they will not testify if the trial is broadcast, and they have substantiated their concerns by citing incidents of past harassment.  See, e.g., Exh. K to Defendant-Intervenors Motion (71 news articles detailing incidents of harassment related to people who supported Proposition 8).  These concerns are not diminished by the fact that some of applicants witnesses are compensated expert witnesses.  There are qualitative differences between making public appearances regarding an issue and having ones testimony broadcast throughout the country.  Applicants may not be able to obtain adequate relief through an appeal.  The trial will have already been broadcast.  It is difficult to demonstrate or analyze whether a witness would have testified differently if his or her testimony had not been broadcast.  And witnesses subject to harassment as a result of broadcast of their testimony might be less likely to cooperate in any future proceedings.


The balance of equities favors applicants.  While applicants have demonstrated the threat of harm they face if the trial is broadcast, respondents have not alleged any harm if the trial is not broadcast.  The issue, moreover, must be resolved at this stage, for the injury likely cannot be undone once the broadcast takes place.


This Court also has a significant interest in supervising the administration of the judicial system.  See this Courts Rule 10(a) (the Court will consider whether the courts below have so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise of this Courts supervisory power).  The Court may use its supervisory authority to invalidate local rules that were promulgated in violation of an Act of Congress.  See Frazier, 482 U. S., at 645646; id., at 652, 654 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).  The Courts interest in ensuring compliance with proper rules of judicial administration is particularly acute when those rules relate to the integrity of judicial processes.  The District Court here attempted to revise its rules in haste, contrary to federal statutes and the policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States.  It did so to allow broadcasting of this high-profile trial without any considered standards or guidelines in place.  The arguments in favor of developing procedures and rules to allow broadcast of certain cases have considerable merit, and reasonable minds can surely differ over the general and specific terms of rules and standards adopted for that purpose.  Here, however, the order in question complied neither with existing rules or policies nor the required procedures for amending them.


By insisting that courts comply with the law, parties vindicate not only the rights they assert but also the laws own insistence on neutrality and fidelity to principle.  Those systematic interests are all the more evident here, where the lack of a regular rule with proper standards to determine the guidelines for broadcasting could compromise the orderly, decorous, rational traditions that courts rely upon to ensure the integrity of their own judgments.  These considerations, too, are part of the reasons leading to the decision to grant extraordinary relief.


In addressing a discrete instance authorizing a closed-circuit broadcast of a trial, Congress has illustrated the need for careful guidelines and standards.  The trial of the two defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case had been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, so it was set to take place in Denver.  That meant the families of deceased and surviving victims in and around Oklahoma City would not have the opportunity to observe the trial.  Congress passed a statute that allowed victims families to watch the trial on closed-circuit television.  42 U. S.C. 10608.  The statute was drawn with care to provide precise and detailed guidance with respect to the wide range of issues implicated by the broadcast.  See 10608(a) (the statute only applies in cases where the venue of the trial is changed to a city that is out of the State and more than 350 miles from the location in which those proceedings originally would have taken place); 10608(a)(b) (standards for who can view such trials); 10608(c) (restrictions on transmission).  And the statute gave the Judicial Conference of the United States rulemaking authority to effectuate the policy addressed by this section.  10608(g).  In the present case, by contrast, over a span of three weeks the District Court and Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued, retracted, and reissued a series of Web site postings and news releases.  These purport to amend rules and policies at the heart of an ongoing consideration of broadcasting federal trials.  And they have done so to make sure that one particular trial may be broadcast.  Congress requirement of a notice and comment procedure prevents just such arbitrary changes of court rules.  Instead, courts must use the procedures prescribed by statute to amend their rules, 28 U. S.C. 2071.


If Local Rule 773 had been validly revised, questions would still remain about the District Courts decision to allow broadcasting of this particular trial, in which several of the witnesses have stated concerns for their own security.  Even districts that allow trials to be broadcast, see Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule 1.8 (EDNY 2009), recognize that a district judges discretion to broadcast a trial is limited, see, e.g., Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, 942 F.Supp. 136, 138 (EDNY 1996) (broadcast forbidden unless there is no interference with the due process, the dignity of litigants, jurors and witnesses, or with other appropriate aspects of the administration of justice).  Consequently, courts in those districts have allowed the broadcast of their proceedings on the basis that those cases were not high profile, E*Trade Financial Corp. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 582 F.Supp. 2d 528, 535 (SDNY 2008), or did not involve witnesses, Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 929 F.Supp. 660, 661 (SDNY 1996); Katzman v. Victorias Secret Catalogue, 923 F.Supp. 580, 586587 (SDNY 1996).  Indeed, one District Court did not allow the broadcasting of its proceedings because the case involv[ed] very sensitive issues.  Schoeps v. Museum of Modern Art, 599 F.Supp. 2d 532, 534 (SDNY 2009).  This case, too, involves issues subject to intense debate in our society.  The District Court intends not only to broadcast the attorneys arguments but also witness testimony.  See Sony BMG, 564 F.3d, at 11 (Lipez, J., concurring) (distinguishing broadcast of attorneys arguments from other parts of the trial).  This case is therefore not a good one for a pilot program.  Even the studies that have been conducted thus far have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high-profile, divisive cases.  See Application for Stay 17 (warning by Judge Edward R. Becker that in truly high-profile cases, one can [j]ust imagine what the findings would be (quoting Exh. 21, at 2, App. to Pet.)). 
III

The District Court attempted to change its rules at the eleventh hour to treat this case differently than other trials in the district.  Not only did it ignore the federal statute that establishes the procedures by which its rules may be amended, its express purpose was to broadcast a high-profile trial that would include witness testimony about a contentious issue.  If courts are to require that others follow regular procedures, courts must do so as well.  The Court grants the application for a stay of the District Courts order of January 7, 2010, pending the timely filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari or the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of mandamus.
It is so ordered.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 08674.Argued November 3, 2009Decided January 13, 2010
The Mobile-Sierra doctrinesee United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to presume that an electricity rate set by a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the Federal Power Acts (FPA) just and reasonable prescription, 16 U. S.C. 7824d(a); the presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.


For many years, New Englands supply of electricity capacity was barely sufficient to meet the regions demand.  FERC and New Englands generators, electricity providers, and power customers made several attempts to address the problem.  This case arises from the latest effort to design a solution.  Concerned parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, established rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and provided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern rate challenges.  FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it presents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public interest.  Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D.C. Circuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERCs approval order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierras public interest standard does not apply.  
Held:The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks FERC investigation.  The presumption is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties.  It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by noncontracting parties.  Pp.511. 
(a)Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but its reasoning strongly suggests that the D.C. Circuits holding misperceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.  Announced three months after the Court of Appeals disposition in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierras instruction to FERC to presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated  contract meets the just and reasonable requirement unless FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.  554 U. S., at ___.  The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the D.C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with, the just and reasonable standard.  Rather, the public interest standard defines what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.  Id., at ___.  And if FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may not escape that presumption.  Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a contract rate that seriously harms the consuming public.  554 U. S., at ___.  Finally, the D.C. Circuits confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrines animating purpose: promotion of the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.  Mobile, 350 U. S., at 344.  A presumption applicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as to everyone elseconsumers, advocacy groups, state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriaecould scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.  Pp.510. 


(b)Whether the rates at issue qualify as contract rates for Mobile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled upon by, the D.C. Circuit.  They remain open for that courts consideration on remand.  Pp.1011.
520 F.3d 464, reversed in part and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.
