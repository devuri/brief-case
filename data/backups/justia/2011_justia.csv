				JUDULANG v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10694.Argued October 12, 2011Decided December 12, 2011
			

				Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted.  Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a unified removal proceeding for exclusions and deportations alike.  But the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substantive grounds for the two actions.  One list specifies what crimes render an alien excludable, see 
8 U.S.C. 1182(a), while anothersometimes overlapping and sometimes divergentlist specifies what crimes render an alien deportable, see 1227(a).
			

				
				
				
				
				Until repealed in 1996, 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.  By its terms, 212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well.  Although Congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for 212(c) in 1996, see 1229b, 212(c)s broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before 212(c)s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 

533 U.S. 289
.
			

				
				
				
				
				In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the basis for exclusion.  Unless that ground is one of the two falling outside 212(c)s scope, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief.  The BIA then determines whether to grant relief based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.
			

				
				
				
				
				This case concerns the BIAs method for applying 212(c) in the deportation context.  The BIAs approach, known as the comparable-grounds rule, evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has a close analogue in the statutes list of exclusion grounds.  If the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes substantially equivalent to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek 212(c) relief.  But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief, even if the aliens particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1988.  After he pleaded guilty to another crime in 2005, DHS commenced a deportation action, charging him with having committed an aggravated felony involving a crime of violence based on his manslaughter conviction.   The Immigration Judge ordered Judulangs deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding Judulang ineligible for 212(c) relief because the crime of violence deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground.  The Ninth Circuit, having previously upheld the BIAs comparable-grounds rule, denied Judulangs petition for review.
			

				Held:The BIAs policy for applying 212(c) in deportation cases is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 
5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A).  Pp.921.
			

				
				
				(a)While agencies have expertise and experience in administering their statutes that no court may properly ignore, courts retain a narrow but important role in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.  Thus, in reviewing the BIAs action, this Court must assess, among other matters, whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 

463 U.S. 29
.  That task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions, or the absence of such reasons.
			

				
				
				The comparable-grounds approach cannot survive scrutiny under this standard.  By hinging a deportable aliens eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categoriesa matter irrelevant to the aliens fitness to reside in this countrythe BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.  Pp.910.
			

				
				
				(b)Even if the BIA has legitimate reasons for limiting 212(c)s scope in deportation cases, it must do so in some rational way.  In other words, the BIA must use an approach that is tied to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system.  The comparable-grounds rule has no connection to these factors.  Instead, it makes 212(c) eligibility turn on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions.  Whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to stay in this country.  Here, Judulang was found ineligible for 212(c) relief because the crime of violence deportation ground includes a few offensessimple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use of a vehiclenot found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion ground.  But the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in the deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of Judulangs case.
			

				
				
				The BIAs approach has other odd features.  In applying the comparable-grounds rule, the BIA has denied relief to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion ground.  Yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group.  In addition, the outcome of the comparable-grounds analysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision.  An aliens prior conviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds, only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground.  In such cases, an aliens eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual officials decision as to which deportation ground to charge.  An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation, while an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.
			

				
				
				In short, the comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien should be deported. Instead, it turns deportation decisions into a sport of chance.  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 

374 U.S. 449
.  That is what the APAs arbitrary and capricious standard is designed to prevent.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				(c)The Governments arguments in defense of the comparable-grounds rule are not persuasive.  First, 212(c)s text does not support the rule.  That section cannot provide a textual anchor for any method of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because it addresses only exclusion.  Second, the history of the comparable-grounds rule does not work in the Governments favor.  The BIA repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying 212(c) to deportable aliens, settling on the current rule only in 2005.  Third, the Governments claim that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money falls short.  Cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider in many contexts, but cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary agency policy.  In any event, it is unclear that the comparable-grounds rule saves money when compared with alternative approaches.  Pp.1621.

			This case concerned the BIA's policy for deciding when resident aliens could apply to the Attorney General for relief from deportation under a now-repealed provision of the immigration law. The Court held that the BIA's policy for applying section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(c), in deportation cases was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). The Court concluded that the BIA's comparable-grounds rule was unmoored from the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allowed an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to govern a matter of the utmost importance -whether lawful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country could stay here. And contrary to the Government's protestations, it was not supported by text or practice or cost considerations. Therefore, the BIA's approach could not pass muster under ordinary principles of administrative law.

				MARCUS HARDY, WARDEN v. IRVING L. CROSS
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
			

				No. 1174.Decided December 12, 2011
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 
28 U. S. C. 2254, imposes a highly def- erential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.  Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, the Court of Appeals departed from this standard, and we therefore grant certiorari and reverse.
			

				
				
				Irving Cross was tried for kidnaping and sexually assaulting A.S. at knifepoint. Cross claimed that A.S. had consented to sex in exchange for money and drugs.  Despite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A.S. testified as the States primary witness at Cross trial in November 1999 and was cross-examined by Cross attorney.  According to the trial judge, A.S.s testimony was halting.  The jury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial judge declared a mistrial.  The State decided to retry Cross on those counts, and the retrial was scheduled for March 29, 2000.
			

				
				
				On March 20, 2000, the prosecutor informed the trial judge that A.S. could not be located.  A week later, on March 28, the State moved to have A.S. declared unavailable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second trial.
			

				
				
				The State represented that A.S. had said after the first trial that she was willing to testify at the retrial.  The State said that it had remained in constant contact with A.S. and her mother and that [e]very indication had been that A.S., though extremely frightened, would be willing to again come to court and testify.  Record, Exh. J, p. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J).  On March 3, however, A.S.s mother and brother told the States investigator that they did not know where she was, and A.S.s mother reported that A.S. was very fearful and very concerned about testifying again.  Record, Exh. K, p. E9 (hereinafter Exh. K); id., at E14.  On March 9 or 10, the investigator interviewed A.S.s father, who also had no idea where [A.S.] was.  Id., at E12.  The fathers only suggestion was to refer the investigator back to the mother.
			

				
				
				On March 10, the State learned from A.S.s mother that A.S. had run away from home the day before and had not returned.*  Exh. J, at 111.  Thereafter, efforts began by members of the Cook County States Attorneys Office and by law enforcement personnel to locate A.S.  Id., at 112.  The State averred that its efforts included the following:
			

				Constant personal visits to the home of [A.S.] and her mother, at all hours of the day and night.  This is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault occurred.
			

				Personal visits to the home of [A.S.s] father.  This is where the victim lived when the sexual assault occurred.
			

				Personal conversations, in English and in Spanish, with the victims mother, father, and other family members.
			

				Telephone calls, in English and in Spanish, to the vic- tims mother, father, and other family members.
			

				Checks at the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County.
			

				Checks at local hospitals.
			

				Checks at the Cook County Department of Corrections.
			

				Check at the victims school.
			

				Check with the family of an old boyfriend of the victim.
			

				Check with the Illinois Secretary of States Office.
			

				[Department of] Public [A]id check.  Id., at 112113.
			

				
				
				The State also inquired at the Department of Public Health, the morgue, the Cook County Jail, the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Immigration Department, and the post office.  See Exh. K, at E14 to E17, E21; App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.  The States investigator was assisted in the search by a police detective and a victims advocate.  The detective visited A.S.s fathers home once and went to A.S.s mothers homeA.S.s last-known residenceon numerous occasions, approximately once every three days, at different hours of the day and night.  Exh. K, at E27 to E29, E35.  On one visit, A.S.s mother told the victims advocate that A.S. could be staying with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away.  Id., at E42 to E43.  The police detective visited the Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriends mother that she had not seen A.S. in several months and that A.S. was not staying with her or her son.  Id., at E33 to E34.  The efforts to find A.S. continued until March 28, the day of the hearing on the States motion.  Id., at E30.
			

				
				
				On a final visit to A.S.s mother on the morning of March 28, the mother informed the police detective that A.S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had said that she did not want to testify and would not return to Chicago.  See id., at E30; 632 F.3d 356, 359 (CA7 2011).  A.S.s mother told the detective that she still did not know where A.S. was or how to contact her.  Exh. K, at E30.
			

				
				
				The trial court granted the States motion and admitted A.S.s earlier testimony.  The trial court concluded that the State had expended efforts that go way beyond due diligence, id., at E65, and that A.S. ha[d] made it impossible for anybody to find where she is ... in spite of what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her], id., at E67.  At Cross retrial, a legal intern from the States attorneys office read A.S.s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury.  According to the opinion below, the clerks reading of the prior testimony did not include the long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk read the transcript with a slight inflection.  See 632 F.3d, at 359.  The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault.
			

				
				
				On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that A.S. was unavailable because [i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in the city and also evident that she was in hiding and did not want to be located.  Id., at 83a.  The court found that the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to locate A.S., and that the trial court had properly allowed the introduction of A.S.s cross-examined testimony from the first trial.  The court, therefore, affirmed Cross convictions and sentence.  The Supreme Court of Illinois denied Cross petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross petition for a writ of certiorari.
			

				
				
				Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
28 U.S.C. 2254 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Cross argued, among other things, that the state court had unreason- ably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-dents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the 
 
Sixth Amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarants presence at trial.  The District Court denied Cross petition, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unreasonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient effort to secure A.S.s presence at the retrial.  The Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of A.S.s testimony and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.
			

				
				
				In Barber v. Page, 

390 U.S. 719 (1968)
, we held that a witness is not unavailable for purposes of the ... confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.  Id., at 724725.  In Barber, we held that a witness had not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes because the State, which could have brought the witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, had made absolutely no effort to obtain [his] presence ... at trial apart from determining that he was serving a sentence in a federal prison.  Id., at 723; see also id., at 725.
			

				
				
				We again addressed the question of witness unavailability in Ohio v. Roberts, 

448 U.S. 56 (1980)
.  In that case, we held, the State had discharged its duty of good-faith effort.  Id., at 75.  We noted that the prosecutor had spoken to the witness mother, who reported that she had no knowledge of her daughters whereabouts and knew of no way to reach [her] even in an emergency.  Ibid.  We also noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the witness name to her parents residence over a 4-month period prior to the trial.  The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness, the Court made clear, is a question of reasonableness.  Id., at 74 (quoting California v. Green, 

399 U.S. 149, 
189, n. 
22 (1970)
 (Harlan, J., concurring)).  We acknowledged that there were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have taken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that [o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.  448 U.S., at 75.  But the great improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their execution.  Id., at 76.
			

				
				
				In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of Appeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith search for A.S. did not represent an unreasonable appli- cation of our Confrontation Clause precedents.  Whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the prosecutions efforts as superhuman, the state court identified the correct 
 
Sixth Amendment standard and applied it in a reasonable manner.
			

				
				
				The Seventh Circuit found that the States efforts were inadequate for three main reasons.  First, the Seventh Circuit faulted the State for failing to contact A.S.s current boyfriendwhom she was with just moments before the alleged assaultor any of her other friends in the Chicago area.  632 F.3d, at 362.  But the record does not show that any of A.S.s family members or any other persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to believe that any of these individuals had information about A.S.s whereabouts.
			

				
				
				Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where A.S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the courts own opinion observed that the information about A.S.s enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was not noteworthy or particularly helpful.  Ibid.  Since A.S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at E42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the school had better information about A.S.s location than did the members of her family.
			

				
				
				Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the States efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial.  A.S., however, had expressed fear about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless appeared in court and had taken the stand.  The State represented that A.S., although fearful, had agreed to testify at the retrial as well.  632 F.3d, at 362.  We have never held that the prosecution must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes, and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.
			

				
				
				As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness presence, see 448 U.S., at 75, but the 
 
Sixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.  And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review set out in 
28 U.S.C. 2254(d) does not permit a federal court to overturn a state courts decision on the question of unavailability merely because the federal court identifies additional steps that might have been taken.  Under AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it cannot be disturbed.
			

				
				
				The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is
			

				Reversed.

				No. 10637.Argued October 11, 2011Decided November 8, 2011
			

				During petitioner Greenes trial for murder, robbery, and conspiracy, the prosecution introduced the redacted confessions of two of Greenes nontestifying codefendants.  A jury convicted Greene.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, did not apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific reference to Greene.  While Greenes petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confessions.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greenes appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Here, the District Court concluded that, because the United States Supreme Courts opinion in Gray had not yet been issued when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greenes claim, the condition for granting habeas relief had not been met.  The Third Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Under 2254(d)(1), clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States includes only this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court adjudication on the merits.

				GREENE, aka TRICE v. FISHER, SUPERINTENDENT, STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT SMITHFIELD, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 10637.Argued October 11, 2011Decided November 8, 2011
			

				During petitioner Greenes trial for murder, robbery, and conspiracy, the prosecution introduced the redacted confessions of two of Greenes nontestifying codefendants.  A jury convicted Greene.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, did not apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific reference to Greene.  While Greenes petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confessions.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greenes appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).

			Defendant filed a federal habeas corpus petition in district court, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction of his nontestifying codefendants' statements violated the Confrontation Clause. At issue was whether ""clearly established Federal law"" under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), included decisions of the Court that were announced after the last adjudication of the merits in state court but before defendant's conviction became final. The Court held that under Section 2254(d)(1), ""clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States"" included only the Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court adjudication on the merits. Because the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision - the last state-court adjudication on the merits of defendant's claim - predated Gray v. Maryland by nearly three months, the Third Circuit correctly held that Gray was not ""clearly established Federal law"" against which it could measure the state-court decision. It therefore correctly concluded that the state court's decision neither was ""contrary to,"" nor ""involved an unreasonable application of,"" any ""clearly established Federal law.""

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				KPMG LLP v. ROBERT COCCHI etal.
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the district court of appeal of florida, fourth district
			

				No. 101521.Decided November 7, 2011
			

				
				    
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				    
				Agreements to arbitrate that fall within the scope and coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9  U.S.C. 1 etseq., must be enforced in state and federal courts.  State courts, then, have a prominent role to play as enforcers of agreements to arbitrate.  Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556 U.S. 49, 59 (2009).
			

				
				    
				The Act has been interpreted to require that if a dispute presents multiple claims, some arbitrable and some not, the former must be sent to arbitration even if this will lead to piecemeal litigation.  See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 217 (1985).  From this it follows that state and federal courts must examine with care the complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction in order to separate arbitrable from nonarbitrable claims.  A court may not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration merely on the grounds that some of the claims could be resolved by the court without arbitration.  See ibid.
			

				
				    
				In this case the Fourth District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida upheld a trial courts refusal to compel arbitration of respondents claims after determining that two of the four claims in a complaint were nonarbitrable.  Though the matter is not altogether free from doubt, a fair reading of the opinion indicates a likelihood that the Court of Appeal failed to determine whether the other two claims in the complaint were arbitrable.  For this reason, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings.
			

				***
			

				
				    
				Respondents are 19 individuals and entities who bought limited partnership interests in one of three limited partnerships, all known as the Rye Funds.  The Rye Funds were managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and Tremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by KPMG.  The Rye Funds were invested with financier Bernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a result of a scheme to defraud.  Respondents sued the Rye Funds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremonts auditing firm, KPMG.
			

				
				    
				Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case.  Against KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action:  negligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla. Stat. 501.201 etseq. (2010); professional malpractice; and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.  Respondents basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper auditing standards with respect to the financial statements of the partnerships.  These improper audits, respondents contend, led to substantial misrepresentations about the health of the funds and resulted in respondents investment losses.  51 So. 3d 1165, 1168 (Fla. App. 2010).
			

				
				    
				KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit services agreement that existed between it and the Tremont defendants.  That agreement provided that [a]ny dispute or claim arising out of or relating to ... the services provided [by KPMG] ... (including any dispute or claim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the services in question are or were provided) shall be resolved either by mediation or arbitration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.  The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.
			

				
				    
				The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that [n]one of the plaintiffs ... expressly assented in any fashion to [the audit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.  51 So. 3d, at 1168.  Thus, the court found, the arbitration clause could only be enforced if respondents claims were derivative in that they arose from the services KPMG performed for the Tremont defendants pursuant to the audit services agreement.  Applying Delaware law, which both parties agreed was applicable, the Court of Appeal concluded that the negligent misrepresentation and the violation of FDUTPA claims were direct rather than derivative.  A fair reading of the opinion reveals nothing to suggest that the court came to the same conclusion about the professional malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims.  Indeed, the court said nothing about those claims at all.  Finding the arbitral agreement upon which KPMG relied would not apply to the direct claims made by the individual plaintiffs, id., at 1167, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial courts denial of the motion to arbitrate.
			

				
				    
				Respondents have since amended their complaint to add a fifth claim.  Citing the Court of Appeals decision, the trial court again denied KPMGs motion to compel arbitration.
			

				
				    
				The Federal Arbitration Act reflects an emphatic fed- eral policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 631 (1985); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 2425 (1983) (noting that questions of arbitrability [must]... be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration).  This policy, as contained within the Act, requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to arbitrate, Dean Witter, supra, at 217, and cannot possibly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the written arbitration agreement, Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 630, n. 5 (2009) (emphasis deleted).  Both parties agree that whether the claims in the complaint are arbitrable turns on the question whether they must be deemed direct or derivative under Delaware law.  That question of state law is not at issue here.  What is at issue is the Court of Appeals apparent refusal to compel arbitration on any of the four claims based solely on a finding that two of them, the claim of negligent misrepresentation and the alleged violation of the FDUTPA, were nonarbitrable.
			

				
				    
				In Dean Witter, the Court noted that the Act provides that written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising out of an existing contract shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.   470 U.S., at 218 (quoting 9 U.S.C. 2).  The Court found that by its terms, the Act leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed.  470 U.S., at 218 (emphasis in original).  Thus, when a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims, the Act requires courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.  Id., at 217.  To implement this holding, courts must examine a complaint with care to assess whether any individual claim must be arbitrated.  The failure to do so is subject to immediate review.  See Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 67 (1984).
			

				
				    
				The Court of Appeal listed all four claims, found that two were direct, and then refused to compel arbitration on the complaint as a whole because the arbitral agreement would not apply to the direct claims.  51 So. 3d, at 1167.  By not addressing the other two claims in the complaint, the Court of Appeal failed to give effect to the plain meaning of the Act and to the holding of Dean Witter.  The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded.  On remand, the Court of Appeal should examine the re- maining two claims to determine whether either requires arbitration.
			

				It is so ordered.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				DAVID BOBBY, WARDEN v. ARCHIE DIXON
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 101540.Decided November 7, 2011
			

				
				    
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				    
				Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court must show that the state courts ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Courts affirmance of respondent Archie Dixons murder conviction.  Because it is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that courts decision, the Sixth Circuits judgment must be reversed.
			

				***
			

				
				    
				Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer in order to steal his car.  Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer, tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him.  Dixon then used Hammers birth certificate and social security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammers name.  After using that identification card to establish ownership of Hammers car, Dixon sold the vehicle for $2,800.
			

				
				    
				Hammers mother reported her son missing the day after his murder.  While investigating Hammers disappearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are relevant here.  On November 4, 1993, a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station.  It is undisputed that this was a chance encounterDixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation.  The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then asked to talk to him about Hammers disappearance.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station.
			

				
				    
				As their investigation continued, police determined that Dixon had sold Hammers car and forged Hammers signature when cashing the check he received in that sale.  Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November 9.  Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking with him for about 45 minutes total.  Prior to the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse to speak with them.
			

				
				    
				Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in Hammers name and signing Hammers name on the check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell the car.  Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee.  The detectives challenged the plausibility of Dixons tale and told Dixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information.  At one point a detective told Dixon that now is the time to say whether he had any involvement in Hammers disappearance because if Tim starts cutting a deal over there, this is kinda like, a bus leaving.  The first one that gets on it is the only one thats gonna get on.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a.  Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew anything about Hammers disappearance, Hoffner had not told him.  Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had [n]othing whatsoever to do with Hammers disappearance.  Id., at 186a.  At approximately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.
			

				
				    
				The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammers grave.  Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer was buried there.  After concluding their interview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police station.
			

				
				    
				Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.  Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in custody.  The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, I talked to my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.  State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004Ohio1585, 805 N.E. 2d 1042, 1050.  The police read Dixon his Miranda rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke with Dixon for about half an hour.  At 8 p.m. the police, now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his Miranda rights.  In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lions share of the blame on Hoffner.
			

				
				    
				At Dixons trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both Dixons initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder.  The State took an interlocutory appeal.  The State did not dispute that Dixons forgery confession was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible because Dixon had received Miranda warnings prior to that confession.  The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixons murder confession to be admitted as evidence.  Dixon was convicted of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sentenced to death.
			

				
				    
				The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixons convictions and sentence.  To analyze the admissibility of Dixons murder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985).  The Ohio Supreme Court found that Dixons confession to murder after receiving Miranda warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.  State v. Dixon, supra, at 332334, 805 N.E. 2d, at 10501052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (We hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite Miranda warnings).
			

				
				    
				Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2254 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  Dixon claimed, inter alia, that the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law.  The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed.  Dixon v. Houk, 627 F.3d 553 (2010).
			

				
				    
				The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as set forth in this Courts holdings, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record.  2254(d); see Harrington, 562 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Courts decision contained three such egregious errors.
			

				
				    
				First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer.  That is plainly wrong.  It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on November 4.  And this Court has never held that a person can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than custodial interrogation.  McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 182, n.3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (If the defendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its progeny] do not apply).
			

				
				    
				Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the 
 Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to cut a deal before his accomplice Hoffner did so.  The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Courtor any courtholding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional.  Cf., e.g., Elstad, supra, at 317 ([T]he Court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned States evidence, does so involuntarily).  Because no holding of this Court suggests, much less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.
			

				
				    
				Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably applied this Courts precedent in Elstad.  In that case, a suspect who had not received Miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody.  Approximately an hour later, after he had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again confessed to the same burglary.  This Court held that the later, warned confession was admissible because there is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspects initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of Miranda, was voluntary.  The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement was also voluntarily made.  470 U.S., at 318 (footnote omitted).
			

				
				    
				As the Ohio Supreme Courts opinion explained, the circumstances surrounding Dixons interrogations demonstrate that his statements were voluntary.  During Dixons first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.  He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammers name, even stating that the police were welcome to that information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammers disappearance.  State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N.E. 2d, at 1049.  Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.  Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.  
			

				The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixons first in- terrogation involved an intentional Miranda violation.  The court concluded, however, that as in Elstad, the breach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual compulsion and thus there was no reason to suppress Dixons later, warned confession.  101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334, 805 N.E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).
			

				
				    
				The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixons confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was the product of a deliberate question-first, warn-later strategy.  627 F. 3d, at 557.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on this Courts decision in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004).  In Seibert, police employed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20-minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her to repeat her prior confession.  542 U.S., at 604606, 616 (plurality opinion).  The Court held that Seiberts second confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it was preceded by a Miranda warning.  A plurality of the Court reasoned that [u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak-  ing a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.  542 U.S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (detailing a series of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object).  Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, noting he would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case ... in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.  Id., at 622.
			

				
				    
				In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the type that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the Miranda warnings Dixon received.  In Seibert, the suspects first, unwarned interrogation left little, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid, making it unnatural not to repeat at the second stage what had been said before.  542 U.S., at 616617 (plurality opinion).  But in this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation that he had [n]othing whatso- ever to do with Hammers disappearance.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a.  Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern here that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because there was no earlier confession to repeat.  Indeed, Dixon contradicted his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to Hammers murder.  Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixons earlier admission to forgery to induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even began.  As the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was simply no nexus between Dixons unwarned admission to forgery and his later, warned confession to murder.  101 Ohio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N.E. 2d, at 1051.
			

				
				    
				Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the Miranda warnings did not effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement because the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one continuum.  542 U.S., at 612, 617.  Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so here.  Four hours passed between Dixons unwarned interrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and learned that police were talking to his accomplice and had found Hammers body.  Things had changed.  Under Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances created a new and distinct experience, ensuring that Dixons prior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warnings he received before confessing to Hammers murder.  542 U.S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn).
			

				
				    
				The admission of Dixons murder confession was consistent with this Courts precedents: Dixon received Mi-  randa warnings before confessing to Hammers murder; the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by the sort of two-step interrogation technique condemned in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixons statements was the product of actual coercion.  That does not excuse the detectives decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation.  But the Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixons forgery confession and the attendant statements given without the benefit of Miranda warnings.  Because no precedent of this Court required Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the States highest court.
			

				
				    
				The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				
				    
				It is so ordered.

				JAVIER CAVAZOS, ACTING WARDEN v. SHIRLEYREE SMITH
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101115.Decided October 31, 2011
			

				
				    
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				    
				The opinion of the Court in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of the jurynot the courtto decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial.  A reviewing court may set aside the jurys verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.  What is more, a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a suf-ficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the fed-eral court disagrees with the state court.  The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was objectively unreasonable.  Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).
			

				
				    
				Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the inevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold.  The Court of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for that of a California jury on the question whether the prosecutions or the defenses expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death.  For this reason, certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

				This case concerns the death of 7-week-old Etzel Glass.  On November 29, 1996, Etzels mother, Tomeka, put Etzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in another room.  Respondent Shirley Ree SmithTomekas motherslept on the floor next to Etzel.  Several hours later, Smith ran into Tomekas room, holding Etzel, who was limp, and told her that [s]omething [was] wrong with Etzel.  Tr. 416.  By the time emergency officials arrived, Etzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat.  Smith reported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa.  The officials efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.
			

				
				    
				Doctors initially attributed Etzels death to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis when an infant shows no outward signs of trauma.  But after an autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of death was instead shaken baby syndrome (SBS).  When a social worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told her that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleeping, so she had picked him up and given him a little shake, a jostle to wake him.  Id., at 842.  According to the social worker, Smith then said something to the effect of, Oh, my God.  Did I do it?  Did I do it?  Oh, my God.  Id., at 847 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In an interview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she had shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said that she had twisted him to try to elicit a reaction.  Smith was arrested and charged with assault on a child resulting in death.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. 273ab (West 2008) (Any person who, having the care or custody of a child who is under eight years of age, assaults the child by means of force that to a reasonable person would be likely to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the childs death, shall be punished by imprisonment ...).
			

				
				    
				At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert medical testimony on the cause of Etzels death.  The prosecution offered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzels death was the result of SBSnot SIDS, as the defense contended.  The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was the medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner who had supervised Etzels autopsy.  Dr. Carpenter is board certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathol-ogy.  He testified that Etzels autopsy revealed recent hem-orrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and other features of Etzels pathology, including a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of the babys head, were consistent with violent shaking.  Dr. Carpenter identified two means by which shaking can result in a babys death: The first is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain to tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain downward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but little direct damage to the brain.  The second is that the shaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly tears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleeding.  Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzels injuries were consistent with the latter pathology.  He also explained that the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall from the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it possible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of internal trauma.  Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that while SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging, Etzels autopsy revealed no such injury.
			

				
				    
				The prosecutions second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich, was the associate deputy medical examiner who actually performed Etzels autopsy.  She is board certified in anatomic pathology and neuropathology.  She corroborated Dr. Carpenters testimony about the autopsy findings, and added that a followup neuropathological examination of Etzels brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhaging.  Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzels brain, she testified that the cause of death was direct trauma to the brainstem.  On cross-examination, she agreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging (absent in Etzels case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of SBS cases.
			

				
				    
				The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is board certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on childhood death by abusive trauma.  He testified that Etzels injuries were consistent with SBS and that old trauma could not have been the cause of the childs death.
			

				
				    
				The defense called two experts to dispute these conclusions.  The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified that Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the result of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging.  He admitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence of retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS.  He also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause of Etzels death was SIDS.  According to Dr. Siegler, Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the basis of studying photographs of the neuropathological examination.  
			

				
				    
				The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr. William Goldie, testified that Etzels death was due to SIDS.  He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a heart murmur, and low birth weightmaking him more susceptible to SIDS.  Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists had not been able to determine the cause of Etzels death and that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.
			

				
				    
				The jury found Smith guilty.  Concluding that the jury carefully weighed the tremendous amount of evidence supporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied Smiths motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison.
			

				
				    
				On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.  After thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testimony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim, concluding:
			

				
				    
				The expert opinion evidence we have summarized was conflicting.  It was for the jury to resolve the conflicts.  The credited evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the jurys conclusions that Etzel died from shaken baby syndrome.  The conviction is supported by substantial evidence.  People v. Smith, No. B118869 (Feb. 10, 2000), App. K to Pet. for Cert. 86.
			

				The California Supreme Court denied review.  App. J, id., at 74.
			

				
				    
				Smith then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, renewing her claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of SBS.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 
110Stat.
1214, that court had no power to afford relief unless Smith could show either that the California Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as reflected in the holdings of this Courts cases, 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), or that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record, 2254(d)(2).  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at10).
			

				
				    
				The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was assigned issued a report acknowledging that [t]his is not the typical shaken baby case and that the evidence against Smith raises many questions.  App. I to Pet. for Cert. 65.  But the Magistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the evidence was clearly sufficient to support a conviction.  Ibid.  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judges report and denied the petition.  App. G, id., at 52.
			

				
				    
				On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with instructions to grant the writ.  Smith v. Mitchell, 437 F.3d 884 (2006).  Despite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial record concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the brainstem was the cause of Etzels death, the Ninth Circuit determined that there was no evidence to permit an expert conclusion one way or the other on that question because there was no physical evidence of ... tearing or shearing, and no other evidence supporting death by violent shaking.  Id., at 890.  The court said that the States experts reached [their] conclusion because there was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death.  Ibid. (emphasis in original).  The court concluded that because [a]bsence of evidence cannot constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt, ibid., the California Court of Appeal had unreasonably applied this Courts opinion in Jackson v. Virginia in upholding Smiths conviction, 437 F.3d, at 890.
			

				
				    
				That conclusion was plainly wrong.  Jackson says that evidence is sufficient to support a conviction so long as after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  443 U.S., at 319.  It also unambiguously instructs that a reviewing court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presumeeven if it does not affirmatively appear in the recordthat the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.  Id., at 326.  When the deference to state court decisions required by 2254(d) is applied to the state courts already deferential review, see Renico, 559 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), there can be no doubt of the Ninth Circuits error below.
			

				
				    
				The jury was presented with competing views of how Etzel died.  It was made aware of the various experts qualifications and their familiarity with both the subject of SBS and the physical condition of Etzels body.  It observed the attorneys for each party cross-examine the experts and elicit concessions from them.  The States experts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that the physical evidence was consistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem caused by shaking.  The Ninth Circuits assertion that these experts reached [their] conclusion because there was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death is simply false.  There was evidence in the brain itself.  The autopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzels brain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence of a blood clot between the brains hemispheres.  The autopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of Etzels head.  These affirmative indications of trauma formed the basis of the experts opinion that Etzel died from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.
			

				
				    
				Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood that the prosecutions experts were unable to identify the precise point of tearing itself.  But as Judge Bea noted in his dissent from the Ninth Circuits denial of rehearing en banc, the experts explained why the location of the tear was undetectable: Etzels death happened so quickly that the effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.  Smith v. Mitchell, 453 F.3d 1203, 1207 (2006).  According to the prosecutions experts, there was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before Etzel died.
			

				
				    
				In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth Circuit plainly erred in concluding that the jurys ver-dict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for the California Court of Appeal to think otherwise.  See 2254(d).  Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are understandable.  But it is not the job of this Court, and was not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the States theory was correct.  The jury decided that question, and its decision is supported by the record.
			

				
				    
				It is said that Smith, who already has served years in prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no danger to society.  These or other considerations perhaps would be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted to executive authorities to help ensure that justice is tempered by mercy.  It is not clear to the Court whether this process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has been.  It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the standards for this discretion.  If the clemency power is exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that calls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.
			

				
				    
				The decision below cannot be allowed to stand.  This Court vacated and remanded this judgment twice before, calling the panels attention to this Courts opinions highlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in 2254(d) habeas cases.  Each time the panel persisted in its course, reinstating its judgment without seriously confronting the significance of the cases called to its attention.  See Patrick v. Smith, 550 U.S. 915 (vacating and remanding in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70 (2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F.3d 1256 (2007) (percuriam); 558 U.S. ___ (2010) (vacating and remanding in light of McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. ___ (2010) (per curiam)), reinstated on remand subnom. Smith v. Mitchell, 624 F.3d 1235 (2010) (percuriam).  Its refusal to do so necessitates this Courts action today.
			

				
				    
				The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

No. 081448.Argued November 2, 2010Decided June 27, 2011
Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.  The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The Act does not comport with the First Amendment.  Pp.218.
(a)Video games qualify for First Amendment protection.  Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium.  And the basic principles of freedom of speech  do not vary with a new and different communication medium.  Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S. 495, 503.  The most basic principlethat government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 573is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words.  But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test.  See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike the New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, Californias Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children.  Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.  That is unprecedented and mistaken.  This country has no tradition of specially restricting childrens access to depictions of violence.  And Californias claim that interactive video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive.  Pp.211.


(b)Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.  R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 395.  California cannot meet that standard.  Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively.  Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.  Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.  California also cannot show that the Acts restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their childrens access to violent videos.  The video-game industrys voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent.  Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so.  The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.    Pp.1118.
556 F.3d 950, affirmed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C.J., joined.  Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.

			Respondents, representing the video game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to California Assembly Bill 1179 (Act), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. 1746-1746.5, which restricted the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. At issue was whether the Act comported with the First Amendment. The Court held that, because the Act imposed a restriction on the content of protected speech, it was invalid unless California could demonstrate that it passed strict scrutiny. The Court held that California had a legitimate interest in addressing a serious social problem and helping concerned parents control their children. The Court held, however, that as a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation was seriously underinclusive, not only because it excluded portrayals other than video games, but also because it permitted a parental or avuncular veto. The Court also held that, as a means of assisting concerned parents, it was seriously overinclusive because it abridged the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents think violent video games were a harmless pastime. The Court further held that the overbreadth in achieving one goal was not cured by the overbreadth in achieving the other and therefore, the legislation could not survive strict scrutiny. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit enjoining the Act's enforcement.

09-1343|"J. McINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO,
individually and as administrator of
the ESTATE OF NICASTRO
certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey
No. 091343.Argued January 11, 2011Decided June 27, 2011
Respondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre), manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and operates.  Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction.  Nicastros jurisdictional claim was based on three primary facts:A U. S. distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyres machines in this country; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jersey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey.  The State Supreme Court held that New Jerseys courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause so long as the manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to sales in any of the States.  Invoking this stream-of-commerce doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102.  Applying its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.
Held:The judgment is reversed.
201 N. J. 48, 987 A.2d 575, reversed.
Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, concluded that because J. McIntyre never engaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of the States laws, New Jersey is without power to adjudge the companys rights and liabilities, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.  Pp. 412.


(a)Due process protects the defendants right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.  A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316.  Freeform fundamental fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered without authority into law.  As a general rule, the sovereigns exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253.  In cases like this one, it is the defendants purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with fair play and substantial justice notions.  No stream-of-commerce doctrine can displace that general rule for products-liability cases. 


The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in Asahi.  The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the stream of commerce.  That concept, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utilities.  It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.  A defendants placement of goods into commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State may indicate purposeful availment.  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298.  But that does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.  The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendants activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.  See, e.g., Hanson, supra, at 253.  In Asahi, Justice Brennans concurrence (joined by three other Justices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the defendants ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.  480 U. S., at 117.  However, Justice OConnors lead opinion (also for four Justices) stated that [t]he substantial connection between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.  Id., at 112.  Since Asahi, the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions.  But Justice Brennans rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this Courts precedents.  Todays conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent with Justice OConnors Asahi opinion.  Pp.410.


(b)Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.  The company had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.  Indeed, the trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with the State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up there.  Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered his jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.  Pp.1012.


Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that the New Jersey Supreme Courts judgment must be reversed, but concluded that because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes in commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without fully considering modern-day consequences.  Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the Courts precedents.  Pp.27.


(a)Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer).  The three primary facts the state high court relied on do not satisfy due process.  None of the Courts precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient.  See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286; Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102.  Here, the relevant facts show no regular  flow or regular course of sales in New Jersey, id., at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); and there is no something more, such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, or marketing, id., at 111, 112 (opinion of OConnor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of jurisdiction.  Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.  And he has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within New Jersey, or that it delivered its goods in the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by New Jersey users.  World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 297298.  Pp.24.


(b)Justice Breyer would not go further.  Because the incident at issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.  At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.  Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.  Pp.47.
Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Alito, J., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Sotomayor and Kagan, JJ., joined.

No. 091343.Argued January 11, 2011Decided June 27, 2011
Respondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre), manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and operates.  Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction.  Nicastros jurisdictional claim was based on three primary facts:A U. S. distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyres machines in this country; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jersey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey.  The State Supreme Court held that New Jerseys courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause so long as the manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to sales in any of the States.  Invoking this stream-of-commerce doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102.  Applying its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.
Held:The judgment is reversed.
201 N. J. 48, 987 A.2d 575, reversed.
Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, concluded that because J. McIntyre never engaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of the States laws, New Jersey is without power to adjudge the companys rights and liabilities, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.  Pp. 412.


(a)Due process protects the defendants right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.  A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316.  Freeform fundamental fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered without authority into law.  As a general rule, the sovereigns exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253.  In cases like this one, it is the defendants purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with fair play and substantial justice notions.  No stream-of-commerce doctrine can displace that general rule for products-liability cases. 


The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in Asahi.  The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the stream of commerce.  That concept, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utilities.  It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.  A defendants placement of goods into commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State may indicate purposeful availment.  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298.  But that does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.  The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendants activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.  See, e.g., Hanson, supra, at 253.  In Asahi, Justice Brennans concurrence (joined by three other Justices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the defendants ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.  480 U. S., at 117.  However, Justice OConnors lead opinion (also for four Justices) stated that [t]he substantial connection between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.  Id., at 112.  Since Asahi, the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions.  But Justice Brennans rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this Courts precedents.  Todays conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent with Justice OConnors Asahi opinion.  Pp.410.


(b)Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.  The company had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.  Indeed, the trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with the State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up there.  Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered his jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.  Pp.1012.


Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that the New Jersey Supreme Courts judgment must be reversed, but concluded that because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes in commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without fully considering modern-day consequences.  Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the Courts precedents.  Pp.27.


(a)Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer).  The three primary facts the state high court relied on do not satisfy due process.  None of the Courts precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient.  See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286; Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102.  Here, the relevant facts show no regular  flow or regular course of sales in New Jersey, id., at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); and there is no something more, such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, or marketing, id., at 111, 112 (opinion of OConnor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of jurisdiction.  Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.  And he has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within New Jersey, or that it delivered its goods in the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by New Jersey users.  World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 297298.  Pp.24.


(b)Justice Breyer would not go further.  Because the incident at issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.  At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.  Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.  Pp.47.
Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Alito, J., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Sotomayor and Kagan, JJ., joined."|"
			This case arose from a products-liability suit filed in New Jersey state court where Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by defendant. The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in England, where defendant was incorporated and operated. At issue was whether the New Jersey courts had jurisdiction over defendant, notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped them there. The Court held that due process protected defendant's right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power. As a general rule, the exercise of judicial power was not lawful unless defendant ""purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.""  The Court held that there could be exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an intentional tort, but the general rule was applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called ""stream-of-commerce"" doctrine could not displace it. Therefore, the Court held that the facts did not demonstrate that defendant purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market and New Jersey was without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of defendant where its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. Accordingly, the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court was reversed.

the ESTATE OF BROWN, etal.
certiorari to the court of appeals of north carolina
No. 1076.Argued January 11, 2011Decided June 27, 2011
Respondents, North Carolina residents whose sons died in a bus accident outside Paris, France, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in North Carolina state court.  Alleging that the accident was caused by tire failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France.  Petitioners tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian markets and differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United States.  Petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina; have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in the State; do not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in the State; and do not solicit business in the State or sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers.  Even so, a small percentage of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.  The trial court denied petitioners motion to dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over petitioners, whose tires had reached the State through the stream of commerce.
Held:Petitioners were not amenable to suit in North Carolina on claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.  Pp.614.
(a)The Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause sets the outer boundaries of a state tribunals authority to proceed against a defendant.  The pathmarking decision of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, provides that state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has certain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  Id., at 316.  Endeavoring to give specific content to the fair play and substantial justice concept, the Court in International Shoe classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants.  First, the Court recognized that jurisdiction could be asserted where the corporations in-state activity is continuous and systematic and gave rise to the episode-in-suit.  Id., at 317.  It also observed that the commission of single or occasional acts in a State may be sufficient to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum connections.  Id., at 318.  These two categories compose what is now known as specific jurisdiction.  Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 414, n.8.  International Shoe distinguished from cases that fit within the specific jurisdiction categories, instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.  326 U. S., at 318.  Adjudicatory authority so grounded is now called general jurisdiction.  Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 414, n.9.  Since International Shoe, this Courts decisions have elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction.  In only two decisions postdating International Shoe has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendants in-state contacts were sufficiently continuous and systematic to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437; and Helicopteros, 466 U. S. 408.  Pp.69.


(b)Petitioners lack the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a suit against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the State.  Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.  The stream-of-commerce cases on which the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of specific jurisdiction in products liability actions, in which a nonresident defendant, acting outside the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm inside the forum.  Many state long-arm statutes authorize courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred within the forum State.  The North Carolina courts stream-of-commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case-specific and general jurisdiction.  Flow of a manufacturers products into the forum may bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction, see, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 297; but ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant.  A corporations continuous activity of some sorts within a state, International Shoe instructed, is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.  326 U. S., at 318.  


Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general jurisdiction.  In the 1952 Perkins case, general jurisdiction was appropriately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the companys affairs were overseen during World War II.  In Helicopteros, however, the survivors of U. S. citizens killed when a helicopter owned by a Colombian corporation crashed in Peru could not maintain wrongful-death actions against that corporation in Texas, where the companys contacts consisted of sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas enterprise]; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.  466 U. S., at 416.  These links to Texas did not constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts  found to exist in Perkins, and were insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither ar[o]se out of  no[r] related to the defendants activities in Texas.  Id., at 415416.  This Court sees no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in Helicopteros, the sales of petitioners tires sporadically made in North Carolina through intermediaries.  Pp.913.  


(c)Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners discrete status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a unitary business, so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in the subsidiaries as well.  Respondents have therefore forfeited this contention.  Pp.1314. 
199 N.C. App. 50, 681 S.E. 2d 382, reversed.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
on application for stay and on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
 [July 7, 2011]
Per Curiam.

Petitioner Humberto Leal Garcia (Leal) is a Mexican national who has lived in the United States since before the age of two.  In 1994, he kidnaped 16-year-old Adria Sauceda, raped her with a large stick, and bludgeoned her to death with a piece of asphalt.  He was convicted of mur-der and sentenced to death by a Texas court.  He now seeks a stay of execution on the ground that his conviction was obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820.  He relies on Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to notify him of his right to consular assistance.  His ar-gument is foreclosed by Medelln v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491 (2008) (Medelln I), in which we held that neither the Avena decision nor the Presidents Memorandum purporting to implement that decision constituted directly enforceable federal law.  552 U. S., at 498499.


Leal and the United States ask us to stay the execution so that Congress may consider whether to enact legislation implementing the Avena decision.  Leal contends that the Due Process Clause prohibits Texas from executing him while such legislation is under consideration.  This argument is meritless.  The Due Process Clause does not prohibit a State from carrying out a lawful judgment in light of unenacted legislation that might someday authorize a collateral attack on that judgment.


The United States does not endorse Leals due process claim.  Instead, it asks us to stay the execution until January 2012 in support of our future jurisdiction to review the judgment in a proceeding under this yet-to-be-enacted legislation.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n.1.  It relies on the fact that on June 14, 2011, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced implementing legislation in the Senate with the Executive Branchs sup-port.  No implementing legislation has been introduced in the House.


We reject this suggestion.  First, we are doubtful that it is ever appropriate to stay a lower court judgment in light of unenacted legislation.  Our task is to rule on what
the law is, not what it might eventually be.  In light of Medelln I, it is clear that there is no fair prospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous, OBrien v. OLaughlin, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2) (Breyer, J., in chambers), and our task should be at an end.  Neither the United States nor Justice Breyer, post, at 16 (dissenting opinion), cites a single instance in this Courts history in which a stay issued under analogous circumstances.


Even if there were circumstances under which a stay could issue in light of proposed legislation, this case would not present them.  Medelln himself sought a stay of execution on the ground that Congress might enact implementing legislation.  We denied his stay application, explaining that Congress has not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our ruling in [Medelln I].  Medelln v. Texas, 554 U. S. 759, 760 (2008) (per curiam) (Medelln II).  It has now been seven years since the ICJ ruling and three years since our decision in Medelln I, making a stay based on the bare introduction of a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified.  If a statute implementing Avena had genuinely been a priority for the political branches, it would have been enacted by now.


The United States and Justice Breyer complain of the grave international consequences that will follow from Leals execution.  Post, at 4.  Congress evidently did not find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow the law as written by Congress.  We have no authority to stay an execution in light of an appeal of the President, post, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign policy consequences, when those assertions come unaccompanied by a persuasive legal claim.


Finally, we noted in Medelln II that [t]he beginning premise for any stay . . . must be that petitioners confession was obtained unlawfully, and that [t]he United States has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access.  554 U. S., at 760.  Here, the United States studiously refuses to argue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention violation, contending instead that the Court should issue a stay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be able to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court, regardless of whether his conviction will be found to be invalid.  We decline to follow the United States suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success.  We may note that in a portion of its opinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural grounds, the District Court found that any violation of the Vienna Convention would have been harmless.  Leal v. Quarterman, 2007 WL 4521519, *7 (WD Tex.), vacated in part subnom. Leal Garcia v. Quarterman, 573 F.3d 214, 224225 (2009).


The applications for stay of execution presented to Justice Scalia and by him referred to the Court are denied.  The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is
denied.*
It is so ordered.
*The United States motion for leave to file an amicus brief is granted.

09-10245|"FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 0910245.Argued February 23, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
In order to reduce unwarranted federal sentencing disparities, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 authorizes the United States Sentencing Commission to create, and to retroactively amend, Sentencing Guidelines to inform judicial discretion.  Title 18 U. S.C. 3582(c)(2) permits a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction.  This case concerns 3582(c)(2)s application to cases in which the defendant and the Government have entered into a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which permits the parties to agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, and  binds the court [to the agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.


Petitioner Freeman was indicted for various crimes, including possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base.  21 U. S.C. 841(a)(1).  He entered into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to plead guilty to all charges; in return the Government agreed to a 106-month sentence.  The agreement states that the parties independently reviewed the applicable Guidelines, noted that Freeman agreed to have his sentence determined under the Guidelines, and reflected the parties understanding that the agreed-to sentence corresponded with the minimum sentence suggested by the applicable Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months, along with a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60 months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(A).  Three years after the District Court accepted the plea agreement, the Commission issued a retroactive Guidelines amendment to remedy the significant disparity between the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses.  Because the amendments effect was to reduce Freemans applicable sentencing range to 37 to 46 months plus the consecutive 60-month mandatory minimum, he moved for a sentence reduction under 3582(c)(2).  However, the District Court denied the motion, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed because its precedent rendered defendants sentenced pursuant to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements ineligible for 3582(c)(2) relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
355 Fed. Appx. 1, reversed and remanded.
Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kagan, concluded that defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under 3582(c)(2).  Pp. 510.


(a)The text and purpose of the statute, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), and the governing Guidelines policy statements compel the conclusion that the district court has authority to entertain 3582(c)(2) motions when sentences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement.  The district judge must, in every case, impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of federal sentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other relevant factors.  3553(a).  The Guidelines provide a framework or starting pointa basis, in the terms commonsense meaningfor the judges exercise of discretion.  Rule 11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to agree on a specific sentence, but that agreement does not discharge the district courts independent obligation to exercise its discretion.  In the usual sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judges reliance on the Guidelines will be apparent when the judge uses the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and imposes a sentence within the range.  Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49.  Even where the judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the deviation, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.  The parties recommended sentence binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), but the relevant policy statement forbids the judge to accept an agreement without first giving due consideration to the applicable Guidelines sentencing range, even if the parties recommend a specific sentence as a condition of the guilty plea, see U. S. Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 6B1.2.  This approach finds further support in the policy statement applicable to 3582(c)(2) motions, which instructs the district court in modifying a sentence to substitute the retroactive amendment, but to leave all original Guidelines determinations in place, 1B1.10(b)(1).  Pp. 57.


(b)Petitioners sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the District Court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence was appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range.  Its decision was therefore based on that range within 3582(c)(2)s meaning.  P. 7.


(c)The Governments argument that sentences that follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based only on the agreement itself and not the Guidelines, and are therefore ineligible for 3582(c)(2) reduction, must be rejected.  Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, the judges decision to accept the plea and impose the recommended sentence is likely to be based on the Guidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek 3582(c)(2) relief.  Pp. 710.


Justice Sotomayor concluded that if an agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the prison term is based on the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under 18 U. S.C. 3582(c)(2).  Pp.111.


(a)The term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant to a (C) agreement is based on the agreement itself, not on the judges calculation of the Guidelines sentencing range.  To hold otherwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreementsto bind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant to determine what sentence he will receive.  Pp.15.


(b)This does not mean, however, that a term of imprisonment imposed under a (C) agreement can never be reduced under 3582(c)(2).  Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement is to allow the parties to determine the defendants sentence, when the agreement itself employs a particular Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offenses in establishing the term of imprisonment imposed by the district court, the defendant is eligible to have his sentence reduced under 3582(c)(2).  Pp.59.


(c)Freeman is eligible.  The offense level and criminal history category set forth in his (C) agreement produce a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months; it is evident that the parties combined the 46-month figure at the low end of the range with the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence under 924(c)(1)(A) to establish the 106-month sentence called for in the agreement.  Under the amended Guidelines, however, the applicable sentencing range is now 37 to 46 months.  Therefore, Freemans prison term is based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, rendering him eligible for sentence reduction.  Pp.911.
Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Roberts, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.

			"|"FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 0910245.Argued February 23, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
In order to reduce unwarranted federal sentencing disparities, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 authorizes the United States Sentencing Commission to create, and to retroactively amend, Sentencing Guidelines to inform judicial discretion.  Title 18 U. S.C. 3582(c)(2) permits a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction.  This case concerns 3582(c)(2)s application to cases in which the defendant and the Government have entered into a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which permits the parties to agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, and  binds the court [to the agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.


Petitioner Freeman was indicted for various crimes, including possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base.  21 U. S.C. 841(a)(1).

			The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (""Act""), 18 U.S.C. 3551 et seq., called for the creation of Sentencing Guidelines to inform judicial discretion in order to reduce unwarranted disparities in federal sentencing. The Act allowed retroactive amendments to the Guidelines for cases where the Guidelines became a cause of inequality. When a retroactive Guideline amendment was adopted, section 3682(c)(2) permitted defendants sentenced based on a sentencing range that had been modified to move for a reduced sentence. In this case, petitioner was indicted for various crimes, including possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base, and entered into a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to plead guilty to all charges where the Government, in return, agreed to a 106 month sentence. At issue was whether defendants who enter into plea agreements that recommended a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea could be eligible for relief under section 3682(c)(2). The Court held that the text and purpose of the statute, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), and the governing Guidelines policy statements compelled the conclusion that the district court had authority to entertain section 3582(c)(2) motions when sentences were imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defendant entered into an Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The Court also held that petitioner's sentencing hearing transcript revealed that the District Court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence was appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range. Therefore, the District Court's decisions was ""based on"" that range within section 3682(c)(2)'s meaning. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.

09-10876|"BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
certiorari to the supreme court of new mexico
No. 0910876.Argued March 2, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
The Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause gives the accused [i]n all criminal prosecutions,  the right  to be confronted with the witnesses against him.  In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59, this Court held that the Clause permits admission of [t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial  only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.  Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a forensic evidence exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked as testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes.  Absent stipulation, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a report without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the reports statements.  557 U. S., at ___.


Petitioner Bullcomings jury trial on charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certifying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI.  Bullcomings blood sample had been tested at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed, signed, and certified the report.  However, the prosecution neither called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason.  In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst, Razatos, to validate the report.  Razatos was familiar with the testing device used to analyze Bullcomings blood and with the laboratorys testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test on Bullcomings blood sample.  Bullcomings counsel objected, asserting that introduction of Caylors report without his testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and permitted Razatos to testify.  Bullcoming was convicted, and, while his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this Court decided Melendez-Diaz.  The state high court acknowledged that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under Melendez-Diaz, but held that the reports admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test results, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in testing Bullcomings blood, qualified as an expert witness with respect to the testing machine and SLD procedures.  The court affirmed Bullcomings conviction.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
147 N.M. 487, 226 P.3d 1, reversed and remanded.
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IV and footnote 6.  The Confrontation Clause, the opinion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.  The accuseds right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.  Pp.816.


(a)If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.  Pp.814.


(i)Caylors certification reported more than a machine-generated number: It represented that he received Bullcomings blood sample intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he performed a particular test on Bullcomings sample, adhering to a precise protocol; and that he left the reports remarks section blank, indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the samples integrity or the analysis validity.  These representations, relating to past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are meet for cross-examination.  The potential ramifications of the state courts reasoning, therefore, raise red flags.  Most witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.  Where, for example, a police officers report recorded an objective fact such as the read-out of a radar gun, the state courts reasoning would permit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or she was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer deployed and the police departments standard operating procedures.  As, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, however, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause.  The comparative reliability of an analysts testimonial report does not dispense with the Clause.  Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62.  The analysts who write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for confrontation even if they have the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.  Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n.6.  Pp.1011.


(ii)Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply because he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine and the SLDs laboratory procedures.  Surrogate testimony of the kind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor knew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses or lies on Caylors part.  Significantly, Razatos did not know why Caylor had been placed on unpaid leave.  With Caylor on the stand, Bullcomings counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to reveal whether Caylors incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty accounted for his removal from work.  And the State did not assert that Razatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcomings blood alcohol content.  More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court believes that questioning one witness about anothers testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.  Although the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair trial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because, on the whole, the trial is fair.  United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 145.  If a particular guarantee is violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation.  Id., at 146.  Pp.1114. 


(b)Melendez-Diaz precluded the States argument that introduction of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause because the report is nontestimonial.  Like the certificates in Melendez-Diaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact in a criminal proceeding.  557 U. S., at ___.  Created solely for an evidentiary purpose, id., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial.  In all material respects, the SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz.  Here, as there, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in police investigations.  Like the Melendez-Diaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis.  And like the Melendez-Diaz certificates, Caylors report here is formalized in a signed document, Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n.2.  Also noteworthy, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts rules that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.  Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities attending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylors assertions as testimonial.  Pp.1416. 
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV and footnote 6.  Scalia, J., joined that opinion in full, Sotomayor and Kagan, JJ., joined as to all but Part IV, and Thomas, J., joined as to all but Part IV and footnote 6.

At trial, the prosecution did not call as a witness the analyst who signed the certification and, instead, called another analyst who was familiar with the laboratory's testing procedures but had neither participated in nor observed the test on petitioner's blood sample. At issue was whether the Confrontation Clause permitted the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made for the purpose of proving a particular fact, through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification. The Court held that surrogate testimony of that order did not meet the constitutional requirement where the accused's right was to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst was unavailable at trial and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist. Accordingly, the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.

09-993|"PLIVA, INC., etal. v. MENSING
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 09993.Argued March 30, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
Five years after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopramide, a drug commonly used to treat digestive tract problems, under the brand name Reglan, generic manufacturers such as petitioners also began producing the drug.  Because of accumulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most recently in 2009.


Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both received the generic drug from their pharmacists.  After taking the drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskinesia.  In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took (Manufacturers).  Each respondent alleged, inter alia, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufacturers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate warning labels.  In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by requiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopramide as was mandated at the time for Reglan.  The Fifth and Eighth Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents claims were not pre-empted.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.
588 F.3d 603 and 593 F.3d 428, reversed and remanded.
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IIIB2, concluding that federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus pre-empt, these state claims.  Pp.414, 1720.


(a)Because pre-emption analysis requires a comparison between federal and state law, the Court begins by identifying the state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufacturers.  Pp.410.


(1)State tort law requires a manufacturer that is, or should be, aware of its drugs danger to label it in a way that renders it reasonably safe.  Respondents pleaded that the Manufacturers knew, or should have known, both that the long-term use of their products carried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk.  Taking these allegations as true, the state-law duty required the Manufacturers to use a different, stronger label than the one they actually used.  Pp.45.


(2)On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs safety labels.  A manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate.  Although the same rules originally applied to all drugs, the 1984 law commonly called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allows a generic drug manufacturer to gain FDA approval simply by showing that its drug is equivalent to an already-approved brand-name drug, and that the safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that approved for the brand-name drug.  Respondents contend that federal law nevertheless provides avenues through which the Manufacturers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here.  These include: (1) the FDAs changes-being-effected (CBE) process, which permits drug manufacturers, without preapproval, to add or strengthen a warning label; and (2) sending Dear Doctor letters providing additional warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals.  However, the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have used either of these processes to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels.   The Court defers to the FDAs views because they are not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations, and there is no other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDAs fair and considered judgment.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462.  Assuming, without deciding, that the FDA is correct that federal law nevertheless required the Manufacturers to ask for the agencys assistance in convincing the brand-name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, the Court turns to the pre-emption question.  Pp.510.


(b)Where state and federal law directly conflict, state law must give way.  See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583.  Such a conflict exists where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.  Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287.   Pp.1114, 1720.


(1)The Court finds impossibility here.  If the Manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide, they would have violated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same as the corresponding brand-name drug labels.  Thus, it was impossible for them to comply with both state and federal law.  And even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA help in strengthening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty exists, they would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty.  State law demanded a safer label; it did not require communication with the FDA about the possibility of a safer label.  Pp.1112.


(2)The Court rejects the argument that the Manufacturers pre-emption defense fails because they failed to ask the FDA for help in changing the corresponding brand-name label.  The proper question for impossibility analysis is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.  See Wyeth, supra, at 573.  Accepting respondents argument would render conflict pre-emption largely meaningless by making most conflicts between state and federal law illusory.  In these cases, it is possible that, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label.  But it is also possible that they could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process to them, persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely, or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  If these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and state law from conflicting, it is unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force.  That Clausewhich makes federal law the supreme Law of the Land  any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding, U. S. Const., Art.VI, cl.2cannot be read to permit an approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but meaningless.  Here, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy its state duties without the Federal Governments special permission and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently satisfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes.  Pp.1214, 17.


(3)Wyeth is not to the contrary.  The Court there held that a state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and federal law under the FDAs CBE regulation.  555 U. S., at 572573.  The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers differ, by Congress design, from those applicable to generic drug manufacturers.  And different federal statutes and regulations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results.  This Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create similar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme.  Congress and the FDA retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so desire.  Pp.1720.

			These consolidated lawsuits involved state tort law claims based on certain drug manufacturers' alleged failure to provide adequate warning labels for the generic drug metoclopramide. State tort law required a manufacturer that was, or should be, aware of its drug's danger to label it in a way that rendered it reasonably safe. On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the manufacturers from independently changing their generic drug safety labels. At issue was whether such federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflicted with, and thus preempted, the state law claims.

10-179|"STERN, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL v. MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10179.Argued January 18, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
Article III, 1, of the Constitution mandates that [t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish, and provides that the judges of those constitutional courts shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour and receive for their Services[] a Compensation[] [that] shall not be diminished during their tenure.  The questions presented in this case are whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S.C. 157 and Article III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickies bankruptcy proceedings.


Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierces father, approximately a year before his death.  Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J. Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tortiously interfered with that gift.  After J. Howard died, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in federal court.  Pierce filed a proof of claim in that proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from Vickies bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in controlling his fathers assets.  Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.


The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of dollars in damages on her counterclaim.  Pierce objected that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on that counterclaim because it was not a core proceeding as defined by 28 U. S.C. 157(b)(2)(C).  As set forth in 157(a), Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that aris[e] under title 11; those that aris[e] in a Title 11 case; and those that are related to a case under title 11.  District courts may refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district, and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.  157(a), (b)(1).  In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy judge may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.  157(c)(1).  Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 categories of core proceedings, including counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.  157(b)(2)(C).


The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickies counterclaim was a core proceeding.  The District Court reversed, reading this Courts precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, to suggest[] that it would be unconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.  The court held that Vickies counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat related to Pierces claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy Courts judgment as proposed, not final.  Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties dispute and entered a judgment in Pierces favor, the District Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickies favor.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed.  It held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim because the claim was not so closely related to [Pierces] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.  Because that holding made the Texas probate courts judgment the earliest final judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclusive effect.
Held:Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickies counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.  Pp.638.
1.Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim.  Pp.816.
(a)The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim as a core proceeding under 157(b)(2)(C).  Pierce argues that 157(b) authorizes bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 itself.  But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of core proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under bankruptcy law, and the structure of 157 makes clear that no such category exists.  Pp. 811.
(b)In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickies counterclaim because his defamation claim is a personal injury tort that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to hear under 157(b)(5).  The Court agrees with Vickie that 157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Courts resolution of the defamation claim.  The Court is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such.  See generally Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___; Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500.  Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree, and the statutory context belies Pierces claim that it is jurisdictional.  Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Courts resolution of the defamation claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to litigate his claim there.  Pp.1216.


2.Although 157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.  Pp.1638.


(a)Article III is an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances that both defines the power and protects the independence of the Judicial Branch.  Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion).  Article III protects liberty not only through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but also by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to protect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.


This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III challenge to a bankruptcy courts resolution of a debtors suit.  In Northern Pipeline, the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978who also lacked the tenure and salary guarantees of Article IIIcould constitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim against an entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.  Id., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion).  The plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized that there was a category of cases involving public rights that Congress could constitutionally assign to legislative courts for resolution.  A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and rejected the debtors argument that the Bankruptcy Courts exercise of jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was acting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.  Id., at 6972; see id., at 9091 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  After the decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress revised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.  With respect to the core proceedings listed in 157(b)(2), however, the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded under the 1978 Act.  The authority exercised by the newly constituted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickies exceeds the bounds of Article III.  Pp.1622.


(b)Vickies counterclaim does not fall within the public rights exception, however defined.  The Court has long recognized that, in general, Congress may not withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.  Murrays Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284.  The Court has also recognized that [a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights,  which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.  Ibid.  Several previous decisions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights exceptionthose arising between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departmentsand those that are instead matters of private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50, 51.


Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the limitation of the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a party.  The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the agencys authority.  In other words, it is still the case that what makes a right public rather than private is that the right is integrally related to particular Federal Government action.  See United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ______ (slip op., at 1011); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 584; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 844, 856.


In Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, the most recent case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a bankruptcy trustees argument that a fraudulent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception.  Vickies counterclaim is similar.  It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches, as in Murrays Lessee, 18 How., at 284; it does not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S., at 584585; and it is not completely dependent upon adjudication of a claim created by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856.  This case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.  If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous public right, then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recognized into mere wishful thinking.  Pp.2229.


(c)The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adjudicate Vickies counterclaim.  Initially, Pierces defamation claim does not affect the nature of Vickies tortious interference counterclaim as one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estatethe type of claim that, under Northern Pipeline and Granfinanciera, must be decided by an Article III court.  The cases on which Vickie relies, Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42 (per curiam), are inapposite.  Katchen permitted a bankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustees voidable preference claim against a creditor only where there was no question that the referee was required to decide whether there had been a voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to allow the creditors claim.  The Katchen Court intimate[d] no opinion concerning whether the bankruptcy referee would have had summary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the [creditors proof of] claim.  382 U. S., at 333, n.9.  The per curiam opinion in Langenkamp is to the same effect.  In this case, by contrast, the Bankruptcy Courtin order to resolve Vickies counterclaimwas required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not disposed of in passing on objections to Pierces proof of claim.  In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.  Vickies claim is instead a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.  Pp. 2934.


(d)The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not adjuncts of the district courts.  The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts considered in Northern Pipeline, do not ma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law or engage in statutorily channeled factfinding functions.  458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).  Whereas the adjunct agency in Crowell v. Benson possessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders  [that] could be enforced only by order of the district court, ibid., a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter appropriate orders and judgmentsincluding final judgmentssubject to review only if a party chooses to appeal, see 157(b)(1), 158(a)(b).  Such a court is an adjunct of no one.  Pp. 3436.


(e)Finally, Vickie and her amici predict that restrictions on a bankruptcy courts ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional costs on the bankruptcy process.  It goes without saying that the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944.  In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical consequences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests.  The framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by state courts and district courts, see 157(c), 1334(c), and the Court does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickies from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the statute.

			"|"STERN, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL v. MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10179.Argued January 18, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
Article III, 1, of the Constitution mandates that [t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish, and provides that the judges of those constitutional courts shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour and receive for their Services[] a Compensation[] [that] shall not be diminished during their tenure.  The questions presented in this case are whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S.C. 157 and Article III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickies bankruptcy proceedings.


Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierces father, approximately a year before his death.  Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J. Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tortiously interfered with that gift.  After J. Howard died, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in federal court.  Pierce filed a proof of claim in that proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from Vickies bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in controlling his fathers assets.  Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.


The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of dollars in damages on her counterclaim.  Pierce objected that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on that counterclaim because it was not a core proceeding as defined by 28 U. S.C. 157(b)(2)(C).  As set forth in 157(a), Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that aris[e] under title 11; those that aris[e] in a Title 11 case; and those that are related to a case under title 11.  District courts may refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district, and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.  157(a), (b)(1).  In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy judge may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.  157(c)(1).  Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 categories of core proceedings, including counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.  157(b)(2)(C).


The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickies counterclaim was a core proceeding.  The District Court reversed, reading this Courts precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, to suggest[] that it would be unconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.  The court held that Vickies counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat related to Pierces claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy Courts judgment as proposed, not final.  Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties dispute and entered a judgment in Pierces favor, the District Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickies favor.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed.  It held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim because the claim was not so closely related to [Pierces] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.  Because that holding made the Texas probate courts judgment the earliest final judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclusive effect.
Held:Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickies counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.  Pp.638.
1.Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim.  Pp.816.
(a)The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim as a core proceeding under 157(b)(2)(C).  Pierce argues that 157(b) authorizes bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 itself.  But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of core proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under bankruptcy law, and the structure of 157 makes clear that no such category exists.  Pp. 811.
(b)In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickies counterclaim because his defamation claim is a personal injury tort that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to hear under 157(b)(5).  The Court agrees with Vickie that 157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Courts resolution of the defamation claim.  The Court is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such.  See generally Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___; Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500.  Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree, and the statutory context belies Pierces claim that it is jurisdictional.  Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Courts resolution of the defamation claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to litigate his claim there.  Pp.1216.


2.Although 157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickies counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.  Pp.1638.


(a)Article III is an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances that both defines the power and protects the independence of the Judicial Branch.  Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion).  Article III protects liberty not only through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but also by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to protect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.


This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III challenge to a bankruptcy courts resolution of a debtors suit.  In Northern Pipeline, the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978who also lacked the tenure and salary guarantees of Article IIIcould constitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim against an entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.  Id., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion).  The plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized that there was a category of cases involving public rights that Congress could constitutionally assign to legislative courts for resolution.  A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and rejected the debtors argument that the Bankruptcy Courts exercise of jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was acting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.  Id., at 6972; see id., at 9091 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  After the decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress revised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.  With respect to the core proceedings listed in 157(b)(2), however, the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded under the 1978 Act.  The authority exercised by the newly constituted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickies exceeds the bounds of Article III.  Pp.1622.


(b)Vickies counterclaim does not fall within the public rights exception, however defined.  The Court has long recognized that, in general, Congress may not withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.  Murrays Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284.  The Court has also recognized that [a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights,  which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.  Ibid.  Several previous decisions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights exceptionthose arising between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departmentsand those that are instead matters of private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50, 51.


Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the limitation of the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a party.  The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the agencys authority.  In other words, it is still the case that what makes a right public rather than private is that the right is integrally related to particular Federal Government action.  See United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ______ (slip op., at 1011); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 584; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 844, 856.


In Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, the most recent case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a bankruptcy trustees argument that a fraudulent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception.  Vickies counterclaim is similar.  It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches, as in Murrays Lessee, 18 How., at 284; it does not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S., at 584585; and it is not completely dependent upon adjudication of a claim created by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856.  This case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.  If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous public right, then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recognized into mere wishful thinking.  Pp.2229.


(c)The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adjudicate Vickies counterclaim.  Initially, Pierces defamation claim does not affect the nature of Vickies tortious interference counterclaim as one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estatethe type of claim that, under Northern Pipeline and Granfinanciera, must be decided by an Article III court.  The cases on which Vickie relies, Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42 (per curiam), are inapposite.  Katchen permitted a bankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustees voidable preference claim against a creditor only where there was no question that the referee was required to decide whether there had been a voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to allow the creditors claim.  The Katchen Court intimate[d] no opinion concerning whether the bankruptcy referee would have had summary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the [creditors proof of] claim.  382 U. S., at 333, n.9.  The per curiam opinion in Langenkamp is to the same effect.  In this case, by contrast, the Bankruptcy Courtin order to resolve Vickies counterclaimwas required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not disposed of in passing on objections to Pierces proof of claim.  In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.  Vickies claim is instead a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.  Pp. 2934.


(d)The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not adjuncts of the district courts.  The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts considered in Northern Pipeline, do not ma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law or engage in statutorily channeled factfinding functions.  458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).  Whereas the adjunct agency in Crowell v. Benson possessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders  [that] could be enforced only by order of the district court, ibid., a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter appropriate orders and judgmentsincluding final judgmentssubject to review only if a party chooses to appeal, see 157(b)(1), 158(a)(b).  Such a court is an adjunct of no one.  Pp. 3436.


(e)Finally, Vickie and her amici predict that restrictions on a bankruptcy courts ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional costs on the bankruptcy process.  It goes without saying that the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944.  In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical consequences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests.  The framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by state courts and district courts, see 157(c), 1334(c), and the Court does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickies from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the statute.  Pp. 3638.
600 F.3d 1037, affirmed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined."|"
			This case stemmed from the long-running dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II, a man believed to have been one of the richest people in Texas. Vickie married J. Howard, Pierce's father, approximately a year before his death. Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court asserting that J. Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tortiously interfered with that gift. The litigation worked its way through state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and California, and two of those courts, a Texas state probate court and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, reached contrary decisions on its merits. The Court of Appeals subsequently held that the Texas state decision controlled after concluding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a counterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her bankruptcy proceeding. At issue was whether the Bankruptcy Court Judge, who did not enjoy tenure and salary protections pursuant to Article III of the Constitution, had the statutory authority under 28 U.S.C. 157(b) to issue a final judgment on Vickie's counterclaims and, if so, whether conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court was constitutional. The Court held that the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie's counterclaim as a core proceeding under section 157(b)(2)(C). The Court held, however, that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the constitutional authority under Article III to enter final judgment on a state law counterclaim that was not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.

10-238|"ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUBS FREEDOM CLUB PAC etal. v. BENNETT, SECRETARY OF
STATE OF ARIZONA, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10238.Argued March 28, 2011Decided June 27, 2011
The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act created a public financing system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candidates for state office.  Candidates who opt to participate, and who accept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign.  They are also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candidates expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed candidates initial state allotment.  Once matching funds are triggered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidateincluding any money of his own that a privately financed candidate spends on his campaignand for every dollar spent by independent groups that support the privately financed candidate.  When there are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Matching funds top out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.


Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Arizona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching funds provision, arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their First Amendment rights.  The District Court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the matching funds provision.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a minimal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizonas interest in reducing quid pro quo political corruption.
Held:Arizonas matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to survive First Amendment scrutiny.  Pp.830.
(a)The matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp.822.


(1)Petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the so-called Millionaires Amendment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which was invalidated in Davis v. Federal Election Commn, 554 U. S. 724.  That lawwhich permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the personal funds remained subject to the original contribution capunconstitutionally forced a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  Id., at 739.  This unprecedented penalty impose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech that was not justified by a compelling government interest.  Id., at 739740.  Pp.810.


(2)The logic of Davis largely controls here.  Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the States initial grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the privately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.  The privately financed candidate must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy.  554 U. S., at 739.  If the law at issue in Davis imposed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably does so as well.


The differences between the matching funds provision and the law struck down in Davis make the Arizona law more constitutionally problematic, not less.  First, the penalty in Davis consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to raise the additional funds.  Here, the direct and automatic release of public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier burden.  Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly financed candidatesa frequent occurrence in Arizonathe matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.  Each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of funding to each of that candidates publicly financed opponents.  Third, unlike the law in Davis, all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidates hands.  Spending by independent expenditure groups to promote a privately financed candidates election triggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome or helpful.  Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he sees fit.  That disparity in controlgiving money directly to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expenditures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candidateis a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.  


The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.  The more money spent on behalf of a privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the State.  The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes, and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.  In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed on privately financed candidates.  Independent groups, of course, are not eligible for public financing.  As a result, those groups can only avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak altogether.  Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choicetrigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speakmakes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups and certainly contravenes the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 573.  Pp.1014.


(3)The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and amicus United States attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersuasive.  


Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law invalidated in Davis, but there is no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater here than in Davis.  Arizona argues that the provision actually creates more speech.  But even if that were the case, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by the state law.  And burdening the speech of somehere privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groupsto increase the speech of others is a concept wholly foreign to the First Amendment, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 4849; cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258.  That no candidate or group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political rival.  And precedents upholding government subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were granted in response to the speech of another.


The burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 558 U. S. ___.  A political candidates disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure obligations.


The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Indeed every court to have considered the question after Davis has concluded that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.  Arizona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be impermissible.  But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides that is constitutionally problematic.  It is the manner in which that funding is providedin direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp.1422.


(b)Arizonas matching funds provision is not justified by a compelling state interest, Davis, supra, at 740.  Pp. 2228.


(1)There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of the matching funds provision is to level the playing field in terms of candidate resources.  The clearest evidence is that the provision operates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the initial public funding allotment.  The text of the Arizona Act confirms this purpose.  The provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled Equal funding of candidates, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 16952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as equalizing funds, e.g., 16952(C)(4).  This Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in leveling the playing field that can justify undue burdens on political speech, see, e.g., Citizens United, supra, at ___, and the burdens imposed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an interest.  Pp.2225.


(2)Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruptionand not level the playing fieldthe burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.  Burdening a candidates expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the States anticorruption interest.  Indeed, reliance on personal funds reduces the threat of corruption.  Davis, supra, at 740741; see Buckley, supra, at 53.  The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be supported by the anticorruption interest.  Such expenditures are political speech  not coordinated with a candidate.  Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___.  That separation negates the possibility that the expenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with which this Courts case law is concerned.  See e.g., id., at ______.  Moreover, [t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by  contribution limitations.  Buckley, supra, at 55.  Given Arizonas contribution limits, some of the most austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.


The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorruption interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the States public funding system, which in turn helps combat corruption.  But the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the States anticorruption interest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.  The matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even greater extent than the law invalidated in Davis.  Those burdens cannot be justified by a desire to level the playing field, and much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a danger of corruption.  The fact that the State may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its public funding system to achieve its desired level of participationwithout an undue drain on public resourcesis not a sufficient justification for the burden.  


The flaw in the States argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.  By the States logic it could award publicly financed candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.  Such measures might well promote such participation, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.  How the State chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State may burden political speechto the extent the matching funds provision doesto ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.  Pp.2528.


(c)Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy is not the Courts business.  But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is.  The government may engage in public financing of election campaigns, and doing so can further significant governmental interest[s].  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 9293, 96.  But the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.  Arizonas program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.  It does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State.  This goes too far; Arizonas matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.  Pp.2830.

Federal Election Commn, 554 U. S. 724.  That lawwhich permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the personal funds remained subject to the original contribution capunconstitutionally forced a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  Id., at 739.  This unprecedented penalty impose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech that was not justified by a compelling government interest.  Id., at 739740.  Pp.810.


(2)The logic of Davis largely controls here.  Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the States initial grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the privately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.  The privately financed candidate must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy.  554 U. S., at 739.  If the law at issue in Davis imposed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably does so as well.


The differences between the matching funds provision and the law struck down in Davis make the Arizona law more constitutionally problematic, not less.  First, the penalty in Davis consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to raise the additional funds.  Here, the direct and automatic release of public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier burden.  Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly financed candidatesa frequent occurrence in Arizonathe matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.  Each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of funding to each of that candidates publicly financed opponents.  Third, unlike the law in Davis, all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidates hands.  Spending by independent expenditure groups to promote a privately financed candidates election triggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome or helpful.  Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he sees fit.  That disparity in controlgiving money directly to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expenditures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candidateis a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.  


The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.  The more money spent on behalf of a privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the State.  The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes, and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.  In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed on privately financed candidates.  Independent groups, of course, are not eligible for public financing.  As a result, those groups can only avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak altogether.  Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choicetrigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speakmakes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups and certainly contravenes the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 573.  Pp.1014.


(3)The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and amicus United States attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersuasive.  


Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law invalidated in Davis, but there is no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater here than in Davis.  Arizona argues that the provision actually creates more speech.  But even if that were the case, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by the state law.  And burdening the speech of somehere privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groupsto increase the speech of others is a concept wholly foreign to the First Amendment, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 4849; cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258.  That no candidate or group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political rival.  And precedents upholding government subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were granted in response to the speech of another.


The burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 558 U. S. ___.  A political candidates disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure obligations.


The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Indeed every court to have considered the question after Davis has concluded that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.  Arizona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be impermissible.  But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides that is constitutionally problematic.  It is the manner in which that funding is providedin direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp.1422.


(b)Arizonas matching funds provision is not justified by a compelling state interest, Davis, supra, at 740.  Pp. 2228.


(1)There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of the matching funds provision is to level the playing field in terms of candidate resources.  The clearest evidence is that the provision operates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the initial public funding allotment.  The text of the Arizona Act confirms this purpose.  The provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled Equal funding of candidates, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 16952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as equalizing funds, e.g., 16952(C)(4).  This Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in leveling the playing field that can justify undue burdens on political speech, see, e.g., Citizens United, supra, at ___, and the burdens imposed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an interest.  Pp.2225.


(2)Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruptionand not level the playing fieldthe burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.  Burdening a candidates expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the States anticorruption interest.  Indeed, reliance on personal funds reduces the threat of corruption.  Davis, supra, at 740741; see Buckley, supra, at 53.  The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be supported by the anticorruption interest.  Such expenditures are political speech  not coordinated with a candidate.  Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___.  That separation negates the possibility that the expenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with which this Courts case law is concerned.  See e.g., id., at ______.  Moreover, [t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by  contribution limitations.  Buckley, supra, at 55.  Given Arizonas contribution limits, some of the most austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.


The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorruption interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the States public funding system, which in turn helps combat corruption.  But the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the States anticorruption interest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.  The matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even greater extent than the law invalidated in Davis.  Those burdens cannot be justified by a desire to level the playing field, and much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a danger of corruption.  The fact that the State may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its public funding system to achieve its desired level of participationwithout an undue drain on public resourcesis not a sufficient justification for the burden.  


The flaw in the States argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.  By the States logic it could award publicly financed candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.  Such measures might well promote such participation, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.  How the State chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State may burden political speechto the extent the matching funds provision doesto ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.  Pp.2528.


(c)Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy is not the Courts business.  But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is.  The government may engage in public financing of election campaigns, and doing so can further significant governmental interest[s].  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 9293, 96.  But the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.  Arizonas program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.  It does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State.  This goes too far; Arizonas matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.

			The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act (matching funds provision), Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Petitioners, candidates and independent expenditure groups, filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the matching funds provision. The Court held that the matching funds provision substantially burdened the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest where the professed purpose of the state law was to cause a sufficient number of candidates to sign up for public financing, which subjected them to the various restrictions on speech that went along with that program. Therefore, the Court held that the matching funds scheme violated the First Amendment and reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

10-779|"SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERMONT, etal. v. IMS HEALTH INC. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 10779.Argued April 26, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through a process called detailing.  Pharmacies receive prescriber-identifying information when processing prescriptions and sell the information to data miners, who produce reports on prescriber behavior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Detailers employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers then use the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.  Vermonts Prescription Confidentiality Law provides that, absent the prescribers consent, prescriber-identifying information may not be sold by pharmacies and similar entities, disclosed by those entities for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, 4631(d).  The prohibitions are subject to exceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used for a number of purposes, e.g., health care research.  4631(e).


Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand-name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials (hereinafter Vermont), contending that 4631(d) violates their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that 4631(d) unconstitutionally burdens the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without adequate justification.
Held:
1.Vermonts statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  Pp.615.


(a)On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based restriction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying information.  The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the content of a purchasers speech.  It then bars pharmacies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will use that information for marketing.  Finally, it prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing.  The statute thus disfavors marketing, i.e., speech with a particular content, as well as particular speakers, i.e., detailers engaged in marketing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426; Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658.  Yet the law allows prescriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used for other types of speech and by other speakers.  The record and formal legislative findings of purpose confirm that 4631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who promote brand-name drugs.  In practical operation, Vermonts law goes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.  R.A.V.v.St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391.  Heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted.  Pp.811.


(b)Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwarranted.  The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regulation.  Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however, 4631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker.  The State next argues that, because prescriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a legal mandate, 4631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to government-held information.  That argument finds some support in Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, but that case is distinguishable.  Vermont has imposed a restriction on access to information in private hands.  United Reporting reserved that situationi.e., a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.  Id., at 40.  In addition, the United Reporting plaintiff was presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury, while respondents claim that 4631(d) burdens their own speech.  That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny.  Vermont also argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales, transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct, not speech.  However, the creation and dissemination of information are speech for First Amendment purposes.  See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 527.  There is no need to consider Vermonts request for an exception to that rule.  Section 4631(d) imposes a speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny, even assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.  Pp.1115.


2.Vermonts justifications for 4631(d) do not withstand heightened scrutiny.  Pp.1524.


(a)The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184.  To sustain 4631(d)s targeted, content-based burden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.  See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480481.  Vermont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the achievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and reducing healthcare costs.  Pp.1517.


(b)Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions confidential, 4631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest.  Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any reason except for marketing.  Vermont might have addressed physician confidentiality through a more coherent policy, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195, such as allowing the informations sale or disclosure in only a few narrow and well-justified circumstances.  But it did not. Given the informations widespread availability and many permissible uses, Vermonts asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify the burdens that 4631(d) imposes on protected expression.  It is true that doctors can forgo the laws advantages by consenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.  But the State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow the doctors prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will allow the information to be used by those speakers whose message the State supports.  Cf. Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728.  Respondents suggest a further defect lies in 4631(d)s presumption of applicability absent an individual election to the contrary.  Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy measure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.  Vermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to avoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detailers.  Cf. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N.Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 168.  Vermont further argues that detailers use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor-patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment decisions.  But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions, it can do so only because it is persuasive.  Fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it.  Pp.1721.


(c)While Vermonts goals of lowering the costs of medical services and promoting public health may be proper, 4631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way.  Vermont seeks to achieve those objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakersi.e., by diminishing detailers ability to influence prescription decisions.  But the fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.  Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535 U. S. 357, 374.  That precept applies with full force when the audiencehere, prescribing physiciansconsists of sophisticated and experienced consumers.  Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 775.  The instant laws defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find detailing instructive.  Vermont may be displeased that detailers with prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand-name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.  Vermont nowhere contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within the meaning of this Courts First Amendment precedents.  The States interest in burdening detailers speech thus turns on nothing more than a difference of opinion.  Pp.2124.
630 F.3d 263, affirmed.

			Vermont's Prescription Confidentiality Law, Vt. Stat.

Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand-name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials, contending that section 4631(d) violated their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. At issue was whether section 4631(d) must be tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so, whether Vermont could justify the law. The Court held that the Vermont Statute, which imposed content-based and speaker-based burdens on protected expression, was subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. The Court also held that Vermont's justifications for section 4631(d) did not withstand such heightened scrutiny and therefore, affirmed the Second Circuit's judgment that section 4631(d) unconstitutionally burdened the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without adequate justification.

09-1476|"BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, etal. v. GUARNIERI
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 091476.Argued March 22, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
After petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief, he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement.  When the borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator ordered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn.  Guarnieri then filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the directives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance, thereby violating his First Amendment right  to petition the Government for a redress of grievances; he later amended his complaint to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the 1983 suit.  The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and the jury found for Guarnieri.  Affirming the compensatory damages award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has petitioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter of solely private concern.  In so ruling, the court rejected the view of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be protected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.

(a)A public employee suing his employer under the First Amendments Speech Clause must show that he spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 147.

Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568.  Although cases might arise in which special Petition Clause concerns would require a distinct analysis, public employees retaliation claims do not call for this divergence.

(b)The substantial government interests that justify a cautious and restrained approach to protecting public employees speech are just as relevant in Petition Clause cases.

Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419.  A petition taking the form of a lawsuit against the government employer may be particularly disruptive, consuming public officials time and attention, burdening their exercise of legitimate authority, and blurring the lines of accountability between them and the public.  Here, for example, Guarnieris attorney invited the jury to review myriad details of government decisionmaking.  It is precisely to avoid this sort of intrusion into internal governmental affairs that this Court has held that, while the First Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not empower them to constitutionalize the employee grievance.  Id., at 420.  Interpreting the Petition Clause to apply even where matters of public concern are not involved would be unnecessary, or even disruptive, when there is already protection for the public employees rights to file grievances and litigate.  Adopting a different rule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employees to circumvent the public concern tests protections and aggravate potential harm to the governments interests by compounding the costs of complying with the Constitution.  Pp. 813.


(c)Guarnieris claim that applying the public concern test to the Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of the private nature of many petitions for redress lacks merit.  Although the Clause undoubtedly has force and application in the context of a personal grievance addressed to the government, petitions to the government assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole.  The Clauses history reveals the frequent use of petitions to address a wide range of political, social, and other matters of great public import and interest.  Pp. 1317.


(d)The framework used to govern public employees Speech Clause claims, when applied to the Petition Clause, will protect both the governments interests and the employees First Amendment right.  If a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of purely private concern, his First Amendment interest must give way, as it does in speech cases.  San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 8283.  If he petitions as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment interest must be balanced against the governments countervailing interest in the effective and efficient management of its internal affairs.  Pickering, supra, at 568.  If that balance favors the public employee, the First Amendment claim will be sustained.  If the balance favors the employer, the employees First Amendment claim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of public concern.  As under the Speech Clause, whether a petition relates to a matter of public concern will depend on its content, form, and context  , as revealed by the whole record.

			"|"BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, etal. v. GUARNIERI
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 091476.Argued March 22, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
After petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief, he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement.  When the borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator ordered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn.  Guarnieri then filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the directives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance, thereby violating his First Amendment right  to petition the Government for a redress of grievances; he later amended his complaint to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the 1983 suit.  The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and the jury found for Guarnieri.  Affirming the compensatory damages award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has petitioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter of solely private concern.  In so ruling, the court rejected the view of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be protected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.  
Held:A government employers allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employees petition relates to a matter of public concern.

			This case concerned the extent of the protection, if any, that the Petition Clause granted public employees in routine disputes with government employers where petitioner filed a 42 U.S.C. 1983 suit after respondent's termination of petitioner as police chief and where petitioner was subsequently reinstated, with directives instructing petitioner in the performance of his duties. Petitioner alleged that the directives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance and violated his First Amendment right to ""petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" At issue was whether the public concern test applied when the employee invoked the Petition Clause. The Court held that a government employer's allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee did not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee's petition related to a matter of public concern. Therefore, the Court held that the Third Circuit's conclusion that the public concern test did not limit public employees' Petition Clause claims was incorrect. Accordingly, the Court concluded that, absent full briefs by the parties, the Court need not consider how the foregoing framework would apply to this case and therefore, vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.

10-10|"TURNER v. ROGERS etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina
No. 1010.Argued March 23, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
After a South Carolina family court ordered petitioner Turner to pay $51.73 per week to respondent Rogers to help support their child, Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in contempt five times.  For the first four, he was sentenced to 90 days imprisonment, but he ultimately paid what he owed (twice without being jailed, twice after spending a few days in custody).  The fifth time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.  After his release, the family court clerk issued a new show cause order against Turner because he was $5728.76 in arrears.  Both he and Rogers were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.  The judge found Turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to 12 months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to make support payments.  After Turner completed his sentence, the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected his claim that the Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing, declaring that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safeguards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.
Held: 
1.Even though Turner has completed his 12-month sentence, and there are not alleged to be collateral consequences of the contempt determination that might keep the dispute alive, this case is not moot, because it is capable of repetition while evading review, Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commn, 219 U. S. 498, 515.  A case remains live if (1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.  Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149.  Here, the challenged action, Turners imprisonment for up to 12 months, is in its duration too short to be fully litigated through the state courts (and arrive here) prior to its expiration.  First Natl Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 774.  And there is a more than reasonable likelihood that Turner will again be subjected to the same action because he has frequently failed to make his support payments, has been the subject of several civil contempt proceedings, has been imprisoned several times, and is, once again, the subject of civil contempt proceedings for failure to pay.  DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, and St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41, distinguished.  Pp. 57.


2.The Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause does not automatically require the State to provide counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child support order, even if that individual faces incarceration.  In particular, that Clause does not require that counsel be provided where the opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express court findings as to the supporting parents ability to comply with the support order. Pp.  716.


(a)This Courts precedents provide no definitive answer to the question whether counsel must be provided.  The Sixth Amendment grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel, see, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696, but does not govern civil cases.  Civil and criminal contempt differ.  A court may not impose punishment in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.  Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n.9.  And once a civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of the contempt and is free.  Id., at 633.  The Due Process Clause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt proceedings than in a criminal case.  Id., at 637641.  Cases directly concerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of such a right only in cases involving incarceration, but have not held that a right to counsel exists in all such cases.  See Inre Gault, 387 U. S. 1; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480; and Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18.  Pp. 710.


(b)Because a contempt proceeding to compel support payments is civil, the question whether the specific dictates of due process require appointed counsel is determined by examining the distinct factors this Court has used to decide what specific safeguards are needed to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335.  As relevant here those factors include (1) the nature of the private interest that will be affected, (2) the comparative risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest with and without additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (3) the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not providing additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].  Ibid.


The private interest that will be affected argues strongly for the right to counsel here.  That interest consists of an indigent defendants loss of personal liberty through imprisonment.  Freedom from bodily restraint lies at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80.  Thus, accurate decisionmaking as to the ability to paywhich marks a dividing line between civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, supra, at 635, n. 7must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a wrongful incarceration.  And because ability to comply divides civil and criminal contempt proceedings, an erroneous determination would also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a criminal proceeding would demand.  Questions about ability to pay are likely to arise frequently in child custody cases.  On the other hand, due process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings where incarceration is threatened.  See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778.  To determine whether a right to counsel is required here, opposing interests and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards must be taken into account.  Mathews, supra, at 335.


Doing so reveals three related considerations that, taken together, argue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the present kind.  First, the likely critical question in these cases is the defendants ability to pay, which is often closely related to his indigence and relatively straightforward.  Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented by counsel.  A requirement that the State provide counsel to the noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation that would alter significantly the nature of the proceeding, Gagnon, supra, at 787, creating a degree of formality or delay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and make the proceedings less fair overall.  Third, as the Federal Government points out, an available set of substitute procedural safeguards, Mathews, supra, at 335, if employed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  These include (1) notice to the defendant that his ability to pay is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.


This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where the underlying support payment is owed to the State, e.g., for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the question what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a defendant can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate, Gagnon, supra, at 788.  Pp. 1016.


3.Under the circumstances, Turners incarceration violated due process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his civil contempt proceeding.  No one provided him with a form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his financial circumstances.  And the trial court did not find that he was able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil contempt and ordered him incarcerated.  P. 16.
387 S.C. 142, 691 S.E. 2d 470, vacated and remanded.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined, and in which Roberts, C.J., and Alito, JJ., joined as to Parts IB and II.

			This case stemmed from petitioner's civil contempt proceedings where South Carolina's Family Court enforced child support orders against him. At issue was whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause required the State to provide counsel at the civil contempt hearing to an indigent person potentially faced with incarceration. The Court held that even though petitioner had completed his 12 month prison sentence, and there were not alleged to be collateral consequences of the contempt determination that might keep the dispute alive, this case was not moot because it was capable of repetition while evading review.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 10174.Argued April 19, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.  In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under 111 of the Act, 42 U. S.C. 7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants.  Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to issuing a final rule by May 2012.  


The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.  Two groups of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners here.  One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts.  According to the complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the Nation.  By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs asserted, the defendants emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law.  All plaintiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.  


The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticiable political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed.  On the threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing.   On the merits, the court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the federal common law of nuisance, relying on this Courts decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 93 (Milwaukee I).  The court further determined that the Clean Air Act did not displace federal common law.  
Held:
1.The Second Circuits exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  P. 6.


2.The Clean Air Act and the EPA action the Act authorizes displace any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants.  Pp.616.


(a)Since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, recognized that there is no federal general common law, a new federal common law has emerged for subjects of national concern.  When dealing with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a federal common law.  Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 103.  Decisions of this Court predating Erie, but compatible with the emerging distinction between general common law and the new federal common law, have approved federal common-law suits brought by one State to abate pollution emanating from another State.  See, e.g., Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241243.  The plaintiffs contend that their right to maintain this suit follows from such cases.  But recognition that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily mean that federal courts should create the controlling law.  The Court need not address the question whether, absent the Clean Air Act and the EPA actions it authorizes, the plaintiffs could state a federal common-law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions because of their contribution to global warming.  Any such claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions.  Pp.69.


(b)[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an unusual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.  Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 314 (Milwaukee II).  Legislative displacement of federal common law does not require the same sort of evidence of a clear and manifest [congressional] purpose demanded for preemption of state law.  Id., at 317.  Rather, the test is simply whether the statute speak[s] directly to [the] question at issue.  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625.  Here, Massachusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.  549 U. S., at 528529.  And it is equally plain that the Act speaks directly to emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants plants.  The Act directs EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of stationary sources that, in [the Administrators] judgment, caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  7411(b)(1)(A).  Once EPA lists a category, it must establish performance standards for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that category, 7411(b)(1)(B), and, most relevant here, must regulate existing sources within the same category, 7411(d).  The Act also provides multiple avenues for enforcement.  If EPA does not set emissions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution, States and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPAs response will be reviewable in federal court.  See 7607(b)(1).  The Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plantsthe same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law.  There is no room for a parallel track.  Pp.911.


(c)The Court rejects the plaintiffs argument, and the Second Circuits holding, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA actually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions standards for the defendants plants.  The relevant question for displacement purposes is whether the field has been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a particular manner.  Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 324.  The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the Legislatures considered judgment concerning air pollution regulation because it permits emissions until EPA acts.  The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation displaces federal common law.  If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome of EPAs forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari.  


The Acts prescribed order of decisionmakingfirst by the expert agency, and then by federal judgesis yet another reason to resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.  The appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse gas-producing sector requires informed assessment of competing interests.  The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in the first instance, in combination with state regulators.  The expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges, who lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order.  The plaintiffs proposal to have federal judges determine, in the first instance, what amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is unreasonable and what level of reduction is necessary cannot be reconciled with Congress scheme.  Pp.1215.


(d)The plaintiffs also sought relief under state nuisance law.  The Second Circuit did not reach those claims because it held that federal common law governed.  In light of the holding here that the Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability vel non of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the federal Act.  Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance law, the matter is left for consideration on remand.  Pp.1516.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 10174.Argued April 19, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.  In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under 111 of the Act, 42 U. S.C. 7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants.  Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to issuing a final rule by May 2012.

			Plaintiffs, several states, the city of New York, and three private land trusts, sued defendants, four private power companies and the federal Tennessee Valley Authority, alleging that defendants' emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or in the alternative, of state tort law. Plaintiffs sought a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap to be further reduced annually. At issue was whether plaintiffs could maintain federal common law public nuisance claims against carbon-dioxide emitters. As a preliminary matter, the Court affirmed, by an equally divided Court, the Second Circuit's exercise of jurisdiction and proceeded to the merits. The Court held that the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401, and the Environmental Protection Act (""Act""), 42 U.S.C. 7411, action the Act authorized displaced any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. The Court also held that the availability vel non of a state lawsuit depended, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the federal Act. Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance law, the matter was left for consideration on remand.

10-235|"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. McBRIDE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 10235.Argued March 28, 2011Decided June 23, 2011
Respondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating hand injury while switching railroad cars.  He filed suit under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable for employees injuries resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.  45 U. S.C. 51.  McBride alleged that CSX negligently (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to train him to operate that equipment.  A verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSXs  negligence caused or contributed to his injury.  The court declined CSXs request for additional charges requiring McBride to show that  [CSXs] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury and defining proximate cause as any cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury complained of.  Instead, relying on Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the Seventh Circuits pattern FELA instruction: Defendant caused or contributed to Plaintiffs injury if Defendants negligence played a partno matter how smallin bringing about the injury.  The jury returned a verdict for McBride.


On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.  The appeals court, however, approved the District Courts instruction and affirmed its judgment for McBride.  Because Rogers had relaxed the proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an instruction that simply paraphrased Rogers language could not be declared erroneous.
Held:The judgment is affirmed.


598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IIIA, concluding, in accord with FELAs text and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock proximate cause standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions.  The charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a railroad workers injury if [the railroads] negligence played a partno matter how smallin bringing about the injury.  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation in FELA cases.  Pp.414, 1619.
(a)CSXs interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive.  Pp. 412.


(1)Given FELAs broad causation language, Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress humanitarian and remedial goal[s] in enacting the statute, FELAs causation standard is relaxed compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542543.  Rogers described that relaxed standard as whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.  352 U. S., at 506.  Because the District Courts instruction tracked Rogers language, the instruction was plainly proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition applicable under FELA.  See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172.  CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of proximate cause.  Drawing largely on Justice Souters concurrence in Norfolk Southern R.Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges that Rogers any part  in producing the injury test displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contributory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the requisite directness of a cause.  Pp. 46.


(2)In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his employers railroad tracks.  A passing train fanned the flames, which spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing.  Attempting to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries.  352 U. S., at 501503.  The state-court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire.  As the fire was something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel, the court found that plaintiffs injury was not the natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.  Ibid.  This Court reversed.  FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incorporate any traditional common-law formulation of proximate causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendants negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.  Id., at 506.  Whether the railroads negligent act was the immediate reason for the fall, the Court added, was irrelevant.  Id., at 503.  The Court then announced its any part  in producing the injury test, id., at 506.


Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of FELAs causation standard.  The State Supreme Court there acknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but considered the respondent railroads part too indirect to establish the requisite causation.  That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in Rogers.  It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.  The interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory history, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523524, this Courts subsequent decisions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews FELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and scholars.  This understanding of Rogers has been accepted as settled law for several decades.  IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32.  To discard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.  Pp. 612.


(b)CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers any part instruction opens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability on the basis of but for causation.  A half centurys experience with Rogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one trial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward award.  


FELAs in whole or in part language is straightforward.  [R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of [FELA] negligence, Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S. 108, 117 (emphasis added).  If negligence is proved, however, and is shown to have played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury, Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred was not [p]robable or foreseeable.  Gallick, 372 U. S., at 120121, and n.8.  Properly instructed on negligence and causation, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their common sense in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no warrant to award damages in far out but for scenarios, and judges would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.  Pp. 1214, 1619.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIIA.  Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Thomas, J., joined as to all but Part IIIA.  Roberts, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.

Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIIA.  Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Thomas, J., joined as to all but Part IIIA.  Roberts, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined."|"
			This case concerned the standard of causation applicable in cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (""FELA""), 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq., which rendered railroads liable for employees' injuries or deaths ""resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence."" Respondent, a locomotive engineer with petitioner, an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating hand injury and subsequently filed suit under the FELA. At issue was whether the causation instruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit was proper in FELA cases where that instruction did not include the term ""proximate cause,"" but did tell the jury defendant's negligence must ""pla[y] a part-no matter how small-in bringing about the [plaintiff's] injury."" In accord with the text and purpose of the Act, the Court's decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, the Court held that the Act did not incorporate ""proximate cause"" standards developed in nonstatutory common law tort actions. The Court held that the charge proper in FELA cases simply tracked the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a plaintiff employee's injury if the railroad's negligence played any part in bringing about the injury. Accordingly, the judgment of the Seventh Circuit was affirmed.

10-277|"WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10277.Argued March 29, 2011Decided June 20, 2011
Respondents, current or former employees of petitioner Wal-Mart, sought judgment against the company for injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay, on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of some 1.5 million female employees, because of Wal-Marts alleged discrimination against women in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  They claim that local managers exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately in favor of men, which has an unlawful disparate impact on female employees; and that Wal-Marts refusal to cabin its managers authority amounts to disparate treatment.  The District Court certified the class, finding that respondents satisfied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), and Rule 23(b)(2)s requirement of showing that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  The Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that respondents met Rule 23(a)(2)s commonality requirement and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2) class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory and injunctive relief requests.  It also ruled that the class action could be manageably tried without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present its statutory defenses if the District Court selected a random set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set.
Held: 
1.The certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with Rule 23(a).  Pp.820.


(a)Rule 23(a)(2) requires a party seeking class certification to prove that the class has common questions of law or fact.  Their claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolutionwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.  Here, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  The crux of a Title VII inquiry is the reason for a particular employment decision, Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U. S. 867, 876, and respondents wish to sue for millions of employment decisions at once.  Without some glue holding together the alleged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members claims will produce a common answer to the crucial discrimination question.  Pp.812.


(b)General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, describes the proper approach to commonality.  On the facts of this case, the conceptual gap between an individuals discrimination claim and the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury, id., at 157158, must be bridged by [s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination, id., at 159, n.15.  Such proof is absent here.  Wal-Marts announced policy forbids sex discrimination, and the company has penalties for denials of equal opportunity.  Respondents only evidence of a general discrimination policy was a sociologists analysis asserting that Wal-Marts corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias.  But because he could not estimate what percent of Wal-Mart employment decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testimony was worlds away from significant proof that Wal-Mart operated under a general policy of discrimination.  Pp.1214.


(c)The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Marts policy of giving local supervisors discretion over employment matters.  While such a policy could be the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim, recognizing that a claim can exist does not mean that every employee in a company with that policy has a common claim.  In a company of Wal-Marts size and geographical scope, it is unlikely that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.  Respondents attempt to show such direction by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short.  Pp.1420.


2.Respondents backpay claims were improperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  Pp.2027.


(a)Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the requested injunctive or declaratory relief.  It is unnecessary to decide whether monetary claims can ever be certified under the Rule because, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief, like backpay, are excluded.  Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single, indivisible remedy would provide relief to each class member.  The Rules history and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims belong instead in Rule 23(b)(3), with its procedural protections of predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out.  Pp.2023.


(b)Respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims were appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not predominate over their injunctive and declaratory relief requests.  That interpretation has no basis in the Rules text and does obvious violence to the Rules structural features.  The mere predominance of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify eliminating Rule 23(b)(3)s procedural protections, and creates incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid monetary relief claims.  Moreover, a district court would have to reevaluate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunctive or declaratory relief.  By contrast, in a properly certified (b)(3) class action for backpay, it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs are still employed at Wal-Mart.  It follows that backpay claims should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  Pp.2326.


(c)It is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of incidental monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) and the Due Process Clause because respondents backpay claims are not incidental to their requested injunction.  Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employees eligibility for backpay.  Once a plaintiff establishes a pattern or practice of discrimination, a district court must usually conduct additional proceedings  to determine the scope of individual relief.  Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 361.  The company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demonstrate that its action was lawful.  Id., at 362.  The Ninth Circuit erred in trying to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula.  Because Rule 23 cannot be interpreted to abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right, 28 U. S.C. 2072(b), a class cannot be certified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims.  Pp.2627.
603 F. 3d 571, reversed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined, and in which Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined as to Parts I and III.

09-11121|"J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina
No. 0911121.Argued March 23, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
Police stopped and questioned petitioner J.D.B., a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student, upon seeing him near the site of two home break-ins.  Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen items was found at J.D.B.s school and seen in his possession, Investigator DiCostanzo went to the school.  A uniformed police officer on detail to the school took J.D.B. from his classroom to a closed-door conference room, where police and school administrators questioned him for at least 30 minutes.  Before beginning, they did not give him Miranda warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his legal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room.  He first denied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.  DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer questions and was free to leave.  Asked whether he understood, J.D.B. nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the stolen items.  He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzos request.  When the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus home.  Two juvenile petitions were filed against J.D.B., charging him with breaking and entering and with larceny.  His public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that J.D.B. had been interrogated in a custodial setting without being afforded Miranda warnings and that his statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.  J.D.B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress.  The court adjudicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court affirmed.  The latter court declined to find J.D.B.s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police custody.
Held:A childs age properly informs Mirandas custody analysis.  Pp.518.
(a)Custodial police interrogation entails inherently compelling pressures, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467, that can induce a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they never committed, Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Recent studies suggest that risk is all the more acute when the subject of custodial interrogation is a juvenile.  Whether a suspect is in custody for Miranda purposes is an objective determination involving two discrete inquires: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.  Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (footnote omitted).  The police and courts must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322, including those that would have affected how a reasonable person in the suspects position would perceive his or her freedom to leave, id., at 325.  However, the test involves no consideration of the particular suspects actual mindset.  Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 667.  By limiting analysis to objective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating each suspects idiosyncrasies and divining how those particular traits affect that suspects subjective state of mind.  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430431.  Pp.58.


(b)In some circumstances, a childs age would have affected how a reasonable person in the suspects position would perceive his or her freedom to leave.  Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 325.  Courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis.  A childs age is far more than a chronological fact.  Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115.  It is a fact that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception, Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a class.  Children generally are less mature and responsible than adults, Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115; they often lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them, Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635; and they are more vulnerable or susceptible to  outside pressures than adults, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569.  In the specific context of police interrogation, events that would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a teen.  Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  Legal disqualifications on children as a classe.g., limitations on their ability to marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.


Given a history replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults, Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115116, there is no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor toanticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect being questioned.  Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 662.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not involve a determination of how youth affects a particular childs subjective state of mind.  In fact, were the court precluded from taking J.D.B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school are specific to children.  These conclusions are not undermined by the Courts observation in Alvarado that accounting for a juveniles age in the Miranda custody analysis could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry, 541 U. S., at 668.  The Court said nothing about whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consistent with the Miranda tests objective nature.  This does not mean that a childs age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore.  Pp.814.


(c)Additional arguments that the State and its amici offer for excluding age from the custody inquiry are unpersuasive.  Pp.1418.


(d)On remand, the state courts are to address the question whether J.D.B. was in custody when he was interrogated, taking account of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, including J.D.B.s age at the time.  P. 18.
363 N.C. 664, 686 S.E. 2d 135, reversed and remanded.

This does not mean that a childs age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore.  Pp.814.


(c)Additional arguments that the State and its amici offer for excluding age from the custody inquiry are unpersuasive.  Pp.1418.


(d)On remand, the state courts are to address the question whether J.D.B. was in custody when he was interrogated, taking account of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, including J.D.B.s age at the time.  P. 18.

Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined."|"
			J.D.B., a thirteen-year-old seventh-grade student, was taken from his classroom to a closed-door conference room where uniformed police and school administrators questioned him for at least 30 minutes regarding two home break-ins nearby. Before beginning, they did not give J.D.B. Miranda warnings, the opportunity to call his legal guardian, or tell him he was free to leave the room. After J.D.B. subsequently confessed to the break-ins and wrote a statement at the request of police, two juvenile petitions were filed against him. J.D.B.'s public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that he had been interrogated in a custodial setting without being afforded Miranda warnings and that his statements were involuntary. At issue was whether the age of a child subjected to police questioning was relevant to the custody analysis of Miranda v. Arizona. The Court held that it was beyond dispute that children would often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, the Court held that a child's age group properly informed the Miranda custody analysis. Accordingly, the Court reversed and remanded to the state courts to address whether J.D.B. was in custody when he was interrogated, taking account of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, including his age at the time.

09-11328|"DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 0911328.Argued March 21, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
While conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Willie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name.  After handcuffing Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and found Daviss revolver.  Davis was then indicted on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  In a suppression motion, Davis acknowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, but Davis raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve the issue on appeal.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted.  While his appeal was pending, this Court announced, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants.  The Eleventh Circuit held, under Gant, that the vehicle search at issue violated Daviss Fourth Amendment rights, but the court declined to suppress the revolver and affirmed Daviss conviction.  
Held:Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.  Pp. 620.
(a)The exclusionary rules sole purpose is to deter future Fourth Amendment violations, e.g., Herring v. United States, 555 U. S. 135, 141, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is thought most efficaciously served, United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348.  For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh the rules heavy costs.  Under a line of cases beginning with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, the result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the flagrancy of the police misconduct at issue. Id., at 909, 911.  When the police exhibit deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the costs.  Herring, supra, at 144.  But when the police act with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the deterrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot pay its way.  See Leon, supra, at 909, 919, 908, n.6; Herring, supra, at 137.  Pp. 69. 


(b)Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitutional under Gant, Davis concedes that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  Under this Courts exclusionary-rule precedents, the acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Pp. 911. 


(c)The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considerations should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this case.  Pp. 1119.


(1)The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive.  This argument erroneously conflates retroactivity with remedy.  Because Daviss conviction had not become final when Gant was announced, Gant applies retroactively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as a basis for seeking relief.  See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 326, 328.  But retroactive application of a new rule does not determine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain.  See Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S. 79, 83, 84. The remedy of exclusion does not automatically follow from a Fourth Amendment violation, see Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13, and applies only where its purpose is effectively advanced, Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347.  The application of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes Griffith nor denies retroactive effect to Gant.  Pp.1216.


(2)Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law by discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent.  Facilitating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consideration in this Courts exclusionary-rule cases.  In any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this Courts review of Fourth Amendment precedents.  If precedent from a federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those cases.  Daviss claim that this Courts Fourth Amendment precedents will be effectively insulated from challenge is overstated.  In many cases, defendants will test this Courts Fourth Amendment precedents by arguing that they are distinguishable.  And at most, this argument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Courts precedents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.

09-1227|"BOND v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 091227.Argued February 22, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
When petitioner Bond discovered that her close friend was pregnant by Bonds husband, she began harassing the woman.  The woman suffered a minor burn after Bond put caustic substances on objects the woman was likely to touch.  Bond was indicted for violating 18 U. S.C. 229, which forbids knowing possession or use, for nonpeaceful purposes, of a chemical that can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans, 229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8), and which is part of a federal Act implementing a chemical weapons treaty ratified by the United States.  The District Court denied Bonds motion to dismiss the 229 charges on the ground that the statute exceeded Congress constitutional authority to enact.  She entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the statutes validity.  She did just that, renewing her Tenth Amendment claim.  The Third Circuit, however, accepted the Governments position that she lacked standing.  The Government has since changed its view on Bonds standing.
Held:Bond has standing to challenge the federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to States.  Pp.314.
(a)The Third Circuit relied on a single sentence in Tennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118.  Pp.38.


(1)The Court has disapproved of Tennessee Electric as authoritative for purposes of Article IIIs case-or-controversy requirement.  See Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 152154.  Here, Article IIIs standing requirement had no bearing on Bonds capacity to assert defenses in the District Court.  And Article IIIs prerequisites are met with regard to her standing to appeal.  Pp.35.


(2)Tennessee Electric is also irrelevant with respect to prudential standing rules.  There, the Court declined to reach the merits where private power companies sought to enjoin the federally chartered Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing and selling electric power, claiming that the statute creating the TVA exceeded the National Governments powers in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  In doing so, the Court repeatedly stated that the problem with the power companies suit was a lack of standing or a cause of action, treating those concepts as interchangeable.  E.g., 306 U. S., at 139.  The question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief typically goes to the merits of a case, however, not to the disputes justiciability, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 92, and conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion.  This happened with Tennessee Electrics Tenth Amendment discussion.   The statement on which the Third Circuit relied here, see 306 U. S., at 144, should be read to refer to the absence of a cause of action for injury caused by economic competition.  To the extent the statement might instead be read to suggest a private party does not have standing to raise a Tenth Amendment issue, it is inconsistent with this Courts later precedents and should be deemed neither controlling nor instructive on the issue of standing as that term is now defined and applied.  Pp.58.


(b)Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment, contends that for Bond to argue the National Government has interfered with state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert only a States legal rights and interests.  But in arguing that the Government has acted in excess of the authority that federalism defines, Bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests.  Pp.814.


(1)Federalism has more than one dynamic.  In allocating powers between the States and National Government, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power, New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181.  It enables States to enact positive law in response to the initiative of those who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times, and it protects the liberty of all persons within a State by ensuring that law enacted in excess of delegated governmental power cannot direct or control their actions.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458.  Federalisms limitations are not therefore a matter of rights belonging only to the States.  In a proper case, a litigant may challenge a law as enacted in contravention of federalism, just as injured individuals may challenge actions that transgress, e.g., separation-of-powers limitations, see, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.  The claim need not depend on the vicarious assertion of a States constitutional interests, even if those interests are also implicated.  Pp.812.


(2)The Government errs in contending that Bond should be permitted to assert only that Congress could not enact the challenged statute under its enumerated powers but that standing should be denied if she argues that the statute interferes with state sovereignty.  Here, Bond asserts that the public policy of the Pennsylvania, enacted in its capacity as sovereign, has been displaced by that of the National Government.  The law to which she is subject, the prosecution she seeks to counter, and the punishment she must face might not have come about had the matter been left for Pennsylvania to decide.  There is no support for the Governments proposed distinction between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential standing rules. The principles of limited national powers and state sovereignty are intertwined.   Impermissible interference with state sovereignty is not within the National Governments enumerated powers, and action exceeding the National Governments enumerated powers undermines the States sovereign interests.  Individuals seeking to challenge such measures are subject to Article III and prudential standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims, but here, where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or controversy, she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from disregard of the federal structure of the Government.  Pp.1214.


(c)The Court expresses no view on the merits of Bonds challenge to the statutes validity.  P.14.
581 F.3d 128, reversed and remanded.

At issue was whether a person indicted for violating a federal statute had standing to challenge its validity on grounds that, by enacting it, Congress exceeded its powers under the Constitution, thus intruding upon the sovereignty and authority of the States. The Court held that petitioner had standing to challenge the federal statute where there was no basis in precedent or principle to deny petitioner's standing to raise her claims.

10-5400|"TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 105400.Argued April 18, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
Petitioner Tapia was convicted of, inter alia, smuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States.  The District Court imposed a 51-month prison term, reasoning that Tapia should serve that long in order to qualify for and complete the Bureau of Prisons Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP).  On appeal, Tapia argued that lengthening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18 U. S.C. 3582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed.  Relying on Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a prison term to assist a defendants rehabilitation, but once imprisonment is chosen, the court may consider the defendants rehabilitation needs in setting the sentences length.
Held:Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendants rehabilitation.  Pp.315.
(a)For nearly a century, the Federal Government used an indeterminate sentencing system premised on faith in rehabilitation.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363.  Because that system produced serious disparities in [the] sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants, id., at 365, and failed to achieve rehabilitation, id., at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines would provide courts with a range of determinate sentences, id., at 368.  Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least imprisonment, probation, or a fine.  See 3551(b).  In determining the appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, 3553(a)(2), but a particular purpose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.  As relevant here, a court ordering imprisonment must recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.  3582(a).  A similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sentencing Guidelines author, to insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.  28 U. S.C. 994(k).  Pp.36.


(b)Consideration of Tapias claim starts with 3582(a)s clear text.  Putting together the most natural definitions of recognizeto acknowledge or treat as validand not appropriatenot suitable or fitting for a particular purpose3582(a) tells courts to acknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment when determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and  [when] determining the length of the term.  Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment below, argues that the recognizing clause is merely a caution for judges not to put too much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.  But his alternative interpretation is unpersuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in 3582(a).  Amicus also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuits reasoning that 3582s term imprisonment relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the determination of the sentences length.  Because imprisonment most naturally means the state of being confined or a period of confinement, it does not distinguish between the defendants initial placement behind bars and his continued stay there.


Section 3582(a)s context supports this textual conclusion.  By restating 3582(a)s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to implement the statutory determination to reject imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation.  Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367.  Equally illuminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.

			"|"TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 105400.Argued April 18, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
Petitioner Tapia was convicted of, inter alia, smuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States.  The District Court imposed a 51-month prison term, reasoning that Tapia should serve that long in order to qualify for and complete the Bureau of Prisons Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP).  On appeal, Tapia argued that lengthening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18 U. S.C. 3582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed.  Relying on Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a prison term to assist a defendants rehabilitation, but once imprisonment is chosen, the court may consider the defendants rehabilitation needs in setting the sentences length.
Held:Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendants rehabilitation.  Pp.315.
(a)For nearly a century, the Federal Government used an indeterminate sentencing system premised on faith in rehabilitation.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363.  Because that system produced serious disparities in [the] sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants, id., at 365, and failed to achieve rehabilitation, id., at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines would provide courts with a range of determinate sentences, id., at 368.  Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least imprisonment, probation, or a fine.  See 3551(b).  In determining the appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, 3553(a)(2), but a particular purpose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.  As relevant here, a court ordering imprisonment must recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.  3582(a).  A similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sentencing Guidelines author, to insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.  28 U. S.C. 994(k).  Pp.36.


(b)Consideration of Tapias claim starts with 3582(a)s clear text.  Putting together the most natural definitions of recognizeto acknowledge or treat as validand not appropriatenot suitable or fitting for a particular purpose3582(a) tells courts to acknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment when determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and  [when] determining the length of the term.  Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment below, argues that the recognizing clause is merely a caution for judges not to put too much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.  But his alternative interpretation is unpersuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in 3582(a).  Amicus also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuits reasoning that 3582s term imprisonment relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the determination of the sentences length.  Because imprisonment most naturally means the state of being confined or a period of confinement, it does not distinguish between the defendants initial placement behind bars and his continued stay there.


Section 3582(a)s context supports this textual conclusion.  By restating 3582(a)s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to implement the statutory determination to reject imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation.  Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367.  Equally illuminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.  When Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave them authority to do so.  See, e.g., 3563(b)(9).  In fact, although a sentencing court can recommend that an offender be placed in a particular facility or program, see 3582(a), the authority to make the placement rests with the Bureau of Prisons, see, e.g., 3621(e).  The point is well illustrated here, where the District Courts strong recommendations that Tapia participate in RDAP and be placed in a particular facility went unfulfilled.  Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report on the SRA provides corroborating evidence.  Pp.612.

09-1205|"SMITH etal. v. BAYER CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 091205.Argued January 18, 2011Decided June 16, 2011
Respondent (Bayer) moved in Federal District Court for an injunction ordering a West Virginia state court not to consider a motion for class certification filed by petitioners (Smith), who were plaintiffs in the state-court action.  Bayer thought such an injunction warranted because, in a separate case, Bayer had persuaded the same Federal District Court to deny a similar class-certification motion that had been filed against Bayer by a different plaintiff, George McCollins.  The District Court had denied McCollins certification motion under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.23.


The court granted Bayers requested injunction against the state court proceedings, holding that its denial of certification in McCollins case precluded litigation of the certification issue in Smiths case.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  It first noted that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act) generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.  But it found that the Acts relitigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his proposed class.  In so doing, the court concluded that Smith was invoking a State Rule, W.Va. Rule Civ. Proc.23, that was sufficiently similar to the Federal Rule McCollins had invoked, such that the certification issues presented in the two cases were the same.  The court further held that Smith, as an unnamed member of McCollins putative class action, could be bound by the judgment in McCollins case.
Held:In enjoining the state court from considering Smiths class certification request, the federal court exceeded its authority under the relitigation exception to the Act.  Pp.518.
(a)Under that Act, a federal court may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except in rare cases, when necessary to protect or effectuate [the federal courts] judgments.  28 U. S.C. 2283.  The Acts specifically defined exceptions, Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 286, are narrow and are not [to] be enlarged by loose statutory construction, Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140, 146.  Indeed, [a]ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.  Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 398 U. S., at 297.  The exception at issue in this case, known as the relitigation exception, authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.  Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147.  This exception is designed to implement well-recognized concepts of claim and issue preclusion.  Ibid.  Because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second courthere, the West Virginia courtevery benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.  For the federal courts class-action determination to preclude the state courts adjudication of Smiths motion, at least two conditions must be met.  First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.  And second, Smith must have been a party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.  Pp.57.


(b)The issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.  This case is little more than a rerun of Chick Kam Choo.  There, a federal court dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on forum non conveniens grounds and then enjoined the plaintiff from pursuing the same claim in Texas state court.  However, because the legal standards for forum non conveniens differed in the two courts, the issues before those courts differed, making an injunction unwarranted.  Here, Smiths proposed class mirrored McCollins, and the two suits substantive claims broadly overlapped.  But the federal court adjudicated McCollins certification motion under Federal Rule 23, whereas the state court was poised to consider Smiths proposed class under W.Va. Rule 23.  And the State Supreme Court has generally stated that it will not necessarily interpret its Rule 23 as coterminous with the Federal Rule.  Absent clear evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to State Rule 23 tracking the federal courts analysis in McCollins case, this Court could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule the same way and, thus, could not tell whether the certification issues in the two courts were the same.  That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.  And indeed, the case against an injunction here is even stronger, because the State Supreme Court has expressly disapproved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)s predominance requirement embraced by the Federal District Court.  Pp.812.


(c)The District Courts injunction was independently improper because Smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.  Generally, a party is [o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought, United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, or who become[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party practice, Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77.  The definition of party cannot be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom McCollins was denied leave to represent.  The only exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the exception that binds non-named members of properly conducted class actions to judgments entered in such proceedings.  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 894.  But McCollins suit was not a proper class action.  Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues should have preclusive effect is the District Courts decision not to certify a class.  Absent certification of a class under Federal Rule 23, the precondition for binding Smith was not met.  Neither a proposed, nor a rejected, class action may bind nonparties.  See id., at 901.  Bayer claims that this Courts approach to class actions would permit class counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing plaintiffs.  But principles of stare decisis and comity among courts generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs.  The right approach does not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment.  And to the extent class actions raise special relitigation problems, the federal Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 provides a remedy that does not involve departing from the usual preclusion rules.  Pp.1218.

			In this case, a Federal District Court enjoined a state court from considering a plaintiff's request to approve a class action. The District Court did so because it had earlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case, brought by a different plaintiff against the same defendant alleging similar claims. The federal court thought its injunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue it had decided. The Court held to the contrary and found that, in issuing the order to a state court, the federal court exceeded its authority under the ""relitigation exception"" of the Anti-Injunction Act (""Act""), 28 U.S.C. 2283, where the statutory provision permitted a federal court to enjoin a state proceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to ""protect or effectuate [the federal court's] judgments."" The Court held that the standard was not met in this case for two reasons. First, the issue presented in the state court was not identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal. Second, the plaintiff in the state court did not have the requisite connection to federal suit to be bound by the District Court's judgment.

DERIVATIVE TRADERS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 09525.Argued December 7, 2010Decided June 13, 2011
Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b5, which forbids any person  [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by Janus Investment Fundfor which JCM was the investment adviser and administratorand that those statements affected the price of JCGs stock.  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had sufficiently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading statements contained in the documents.  Before this Court, First Derivative continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under 20(a).
Held:Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b5.  Pp. 512.
(a)Although neither Rule 10b5 nor the statute it interprets, 10(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an action is implied under 10(b).  Superintendent of Ins. of N.Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U. S. 6, 13, n.9.  That holding remains the law, Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at issue, the Court is mindful that it must give narrow dimensions  to a right  Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited it, id., at 167.  Pp. 510.


(1)For Rule 10b5 purposes, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it.  Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not make a statement in its own right.  This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b5s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute substantial assistance to the making of a statement but do not actually make it.  Reading make more broadly, to include persons or entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substantially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors almost nonexistent.  The Courts interpretation is also suggested by Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167.  Pp. 68.


(2)The Court rejects the Governments contention that make should be defined as create, thereby allowing private plaintiffs to sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that another person puts into a statement.  Adopting that definition would be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a private Rule 10b5 suit against companies involved in deceptive transactions, even when information about those transactions was later incorporated into false public statements.  First Derivative notes the uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reapportionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly the responsibility of Congress, not the courts.  Furthermore, First Derivatives rule would read into Rule 10b5 a theory of liability similar tobut broader thancontrol-person liability under 20(a).  Pp. 810.

			Respondent, First Derivative Traders, representing a class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (""JCG""), filed a private action under the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") Rule 10b-5, alleging that JCG and its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC (""JCM""), made false statements in mutual funds prospectuses filed by Janus Investment Fund, for which JCM was the investment adviser and administrator, and that those statements affected the price of JCG's stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it was a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. At issue was whether JCM, a mutual fund investment adviser, could be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b-5 for false statements included in its client mutual funds' prospectuses. The Court held that, because the false statements included in the prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG could not be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b-5. The Court found that, although JCM could have been significantly involved in preparing the prospectuses, it did not itself ""make"" the statements at issue for Rule 10b-5 purposes where its assistance in crafting what was said was subject to Janus Investment Fund's ultimate control. Accordingly, respondent had not stated a claim against JCM under Rule 10b-5 and the judgment of the Fourth Circuit was reversed.

10-382|"UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 10382.Argued April 20, 2011Decided June 13, 2011
Respondent Jicarilla Apache Nations (Tribe) reservation contains natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes administered by the Interior Department.  Proceeds from these resources are held by the United States in trust for the Tribe.  The Tribe filed a breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking monetary damages for the Governments alleged mismanagement of the Tribes trust funds in violation of 25 U. S.C. 161162a and other laws.  During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production of certain documents.  The Government agreed to release some of the documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the attorney-client privilege.  The CFC granted the motion in part, holding that departmental communications relating to the management of trust funds fall within a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege.  Under that exception, which courts have applied to common-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against trust beneficiaries.


Denying the Governments petition for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.  The appeals court held that the United States cannot deny a tribes request to discover communications between the Government and its attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when those communications concern management of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications.
Held:The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not apply to the general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.  Pp.524.
(a)The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and the nature of the Indian trust relationship.  Pp.514.


(1)Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust funds were used to pay the attorney.  In the leading American case, Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.C. v. Zimmer, 355 A.2d 709, the Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memorandum related to the trusts administration because: (1) the trustees had obtained the legal advice as mere representative[s] of the beneficiaries, who were the real clients of the attorney, id., at 711712, and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the beneficiaries outweighed the trustees interest in the attorney-client privilege, id., at 714.  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary exception based on the same two criteria.  Pp.69.


(2)The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private trustee.  While the United States responsibilities with respect to the management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far.  The Governments trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by statute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (NavajoI), and in fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437.  Once federal law imposes fiduciary obligations on the Government, the common law could play a role, United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II); e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475476.  But the applicable statutes and regulations control.  When the Tribe cannot identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Government violated neither the Governments control over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.  Navajo II, supra, at ___.  Pp.914.


(b)The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.  Pp.1423.


(1)In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the real client based on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust.  Riggs, 355 A.2d, at 711712.  Applying these factors, the Court concludes that the United States does not obtain legal advice as a mere representative of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the real client for whom that advice is intended.  See id., at 711.  Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe.  The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe.  Because its sovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries private interests, the Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, capacity.  Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communications purpose.  In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may need to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental and conservation obligations.  It may also face conflicting duties to different tribes or individual Indians.  It may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help determine whether there are conflicting interests at all.  For the attorney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable.  See, e.g., Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18.  The Government will not always be able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests, especially before receiving counsels advice.  If the Government were required to identify the specific interests it considered in each communication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be substantially compromised.  See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 393.  Pp.1520.


(2)The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception properly applied here because of the fiduciarys duty to disclose all trust-management-related information to the beneficiary.  The Government, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.  In this case, 25 U. S.C. 162a(d) delineates the Governments trust responsibilities.  It identifies the Interior Secretarys obligation to supply tribal account holders with periodic statements of their account performance and to make available on a daily basis their account balances, 162a(d)(5).  The Secretary has complied with these requirements in regulations mandating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly statement of performance.  25 CFR pt. 115.8.  The common law of trusts does not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regulations.  A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibilities as nonexhaustive, see 162a(d), cannot be read to include a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts, since that would vitiate Congress specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations, see, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Riggs Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837.  By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue are classed the property of the United States while other records are the property of the tribe.  25 CFR 115.1000.  This Court considers ownership of records to be a significant factor in deciding who ought to have access to the document, Riggs, supra, at 712.  Here, that privilege belongs to the United States.  Pp.2023.
590 F.3d 1305, reversed and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Breyer, J., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

09-11311|"SYKES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 0911311.Argued January 12, 2011Decided June 9, 2011
When he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 8 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), petitioner Sykes had prior convictions for at least three felonies, including the state-law crime of us[ing] a vehicle to knowingly or intentionally fle[e] from a law enforcement officer after being ordered to stop, Ind. Code 354433(b)(1)(A) (2004).  The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions subjected Sykes to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S.C. 924(e), provides for an armed defendant who has three prior violent felony convictions.  Rejecting Sykes argument that his vehicle flight felony was not violent under ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 
Held:Felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, is a violent felony for purposes of ACCA.  Pp. 514.
(a)The categorical approach used to determine if a particular crime is a violent felony consider[s] whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision [of 18 U. S.C. 924(e)(2)(B)], without inquiring into the specific conduct of th[e] particular offender.  James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 202 (emphasis deleted).  When punishable by more than one year in prison, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes that involve use of explosives are violet felonies.  Under the residual clause in question so too is a crime that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., a risk comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the statutes enumerated offenses.  Id., at 203.  When a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of the offense.  Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  His indifference to these collateral consequences has violenteven lethalpotential for others.  A fleeing criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  Also telling is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.  In fact, the risks associated with vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.  While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of personal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes than for vehicle pursuits.  Thus, Indianas prohibition on vehicle flight falls within 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)s residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  Pp. 59.


(b)Sykes argumentthat Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, and Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, require ACCA predicate crimes to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is notoverreads those opinions.  In general, levels of risk divide crimes that qualify as violent felonies from those that do not.  Chambers is no exception: It explained that failure to report does not qualify because the typical offender is not significantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender.  555 U. S., at ______.  Begay, which held that driving under the influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate and stated that it is not purposeful, violent, and aggressive, 553 U. S., at 145148, is the Courts sole residual clause decision in which risk was not the dispositive factor.  But Begay also gave a more specific reason for its holding: DUI need not be purposeful or deliberate, id., at 145, and is analogous to strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.  Begays purposeful, violent, and aggressive phrase is an addition to the statutory text that has no precise link to the residual clause.  Because vehicle flight is not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and is, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in the residual clause, it is a violent felony.  Pp. 1011


(c)Sykes contends that the fact that Ind. Code 354433(b)(1)(B) criminalizes flight by an offender who operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person indicates that Indiana did not intend for 354433(b)(1)(A), under which he was convicted, to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights reached by subsection (b)(1)(B).  This argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats the two subsections as felonies of the same magnitude carrying similar prison terms, suggesting that subsection (b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) violation.  Pp. 1113.


(d)Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  The residual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that presented by several enumerated offenses.  It instructs potential recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again transgress.  This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a person to conform his conduct to the law.  While this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact.  Pp.1314.

			When petitioner pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, he had prior convictions for at least three felonies, including the state-law crime of ""using a vehicle"" to ""knowingly or intentionally"" ""flee from a law enforcement officer"" after being ordered to stop pursuant to Ind. Code 35-44-3-3(b)(1)(A). The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions subjected petitioner to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the Armed Career Criminal Act (""ACCT""), 18 U.S.C. 924(e), provided for an armed defendant who had three prior ""violent felony"" convictions. Rejecting petitioner's argument that his vehicle flight felony was not ""violent"" under the ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The Court held that felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, was a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA where felony vehicle flight presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another; where, because felony vehicle flight was not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and was, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in the residual clause, it was a violent felony; where Indiana treated subsection 35-44-3-3(b)(1)(A) and 35-44-3-3(b)(1)(B) as felonies of the same magnitude carrying similar prison terms; and where Congress had power to enact the residual clause to impose enhanced punishment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that presented by several enumerated offenses. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.

09-1533|"DePIERRE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 091533.Argued February 28, 2011Decided June 9, 2011
In 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugsin particular, the new phenomenon of crack cocaineprompted Congress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine-related substances.  Following several hearings, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA).  The statute provides a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses involving (ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of  (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.  21 U. S.C. 841(b)(1)(A).  The statute similarly provides a 5-year sentence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii).  841(b)(1)(B).


In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base under 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).  The District Court declined DePierres request that the jury be instructed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of cocaine base, it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.  DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120 months in prison mandated by the statute.  The First Circuit affirmed, rejecting DePierres argument that 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine.  Instead, it adhered to its precedent holding that cocaine base refers to all forms of cocaine base.
Held:[C]ocaine base, as used in 841(b)(1), means not just crack cocaine, but cocaine in its chemically basic form.  Pp. 718.
(a)The most natural reading of cocaine base in clause (iii) is cocaine in its chemically basic formi.e., the molecule found in crack cocaine, freebase, and coca paste.  On its plain terms, then, cocaine base reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine.  In arguing to the contrary, DePierre urges the Court to stray far from the statutes text, which nowhere contains the term crack cocaine.  The Governments reading, on the other hand, follows the words Congress chose to use.  DePierre is correct that cocaine base is technically redundantchemically speaking, cocaine is a base.  But Congress had good reason to use cocaine baseto make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride (i.e., powder cocaine) or other nonbasic cocaine-related substances.  At the time the statute was enacted, cocaine was commonly used to refer to powder cocaine, and the scientific and medical literature often uses cocaine to refer to all cocaine-related substances, including ones that are not chemically basic.  Pp. 710. 


(b)This reading of cocaine base is also consistent with 841(b)(1)s somewhat confusing structure.  Subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) lists cocaine, along with its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, as elements subject to clause (ii)s higher quantity threshold.  DePierre is correct that, because cocaine and cocaine base both refer to chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized according to the lower quantity threshold of clause (iii), and never the higher threshold clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances containing cocaine.  But the Court does not agree that the term cocaine in clause (ii) is therefore superfluousin light of the structure of subclause (II), cocaine is needed as the reference point for salts and isomers, which would otherwise be meaningless.


The term cocaine in clause (ii) also performs another critical function.  Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.  Thus, clause (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for a subset of those substancesthe ones that contai[n] cocaine base.  For this structure to work, however, 841(b)(1) must describ[e] in clause (ii) substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the subset described in clause (iii).  Congress thus had good reason to include the term cocaine in clause (ii), and the slight inconsistency created by its use of cocaine base in clause (iii) is insufficient reason to adopt DePierres interpretation.  Pp. 1013.


(c)DePierres additional arguments are unpersuasive.  First, the records of the 1986 congressional hearings do not support his contention that Congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving crack cocaine.  Second, reading cocaine base to mean chemically basic cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, does not lead to an absurd result.  Third, the fact that cocaine base in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is defined as crack does not require that the statutory term be interpreted the same way.  Fourth, the statute is sufficiently clear that the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierres favor.  Pp.1318.

THOMPSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 09571.Argued October 6, 2010Decided March 29, 2011
Petitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorneys Office concedes that, in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery, prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to disclose a crime lab report.  Because of his robbery conviction, Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was convicted.  A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report was discovered.  A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge.  He then filed suit against the district attorneys office under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the offices deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors to avoid such constitutional violations.  The district court held that, to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that the need for training was obvious.  The jury found the district attorneys office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson damages.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.

Held:A district attorneys office may not be held liable under 1983 for failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation.  Pp. 620.
(a)Plaintiffs seeking to impose 1983 liability on local governments must prove that their injury was caused by action pursuant to official municipal policy, which includes the decisions of a governments lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691.  A local governments decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for 1983 purposes, but the failure to train must amount to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.  Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388.  Deliberate indifference in this context requires proof that city policymakers disregarded the known or obvious consequence that a particular omission in their training program would cause city employees to violate citizens constitutional rights.  Board of Commrs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.  Pp.69.


(b)A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is ordinarily necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference.  Bryan Cty., supra, at 409.  Without notice that a course of training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.  Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial could not have put the district attorneys office on notice of the need for specific training.  Pp. 910.


(c)Thompson mistakenly relies on the single-incident liability hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his case was the obvious consequence of failing to provide specific Brady training and that this obviousness showing can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.  In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the citys deliberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely, violations of constitutional rights.  Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Cantons hypothesized single-incident liability.  The obvious need for specific legal training present in Cantons scenariopolice academy applicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledgeis absent here.  Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment.  They receive training before entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing education requirements, often train on the job with more experienced attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical obligations.  Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain.  Thus, recurring constitutional violations are not the obvious consequence of failing to provide prosecutors with formal in-house training.  The nuance of the allegedly necessary training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate indifference here.  Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts, as it must, to a decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.

10-313|"TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL TELEPHONE CO. dba AT&T MICHIGAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 10313.Argued March 30, 2011Decided June 9, 2011
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs)i.e., providers of local telephone serviceto share their physical networks with competitive LECs at cost-based rates in two ways relevant here.  First, 47 U. S.C. 251(c)(3) requires an incumbent LEC to lease on an unbundled basisi.e., a la cartenetwork elements specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.  In identifying those elements, the FCC must consider whether access is necessary and whether failing to provide it would impair the competitors provision of service.  251(d)(2).  Second, 251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs provide  interconnection between their networks and competitive LECs to ensure that a competitors customers can call the incumbents customers, and vice versa.  The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.


In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, contrary to previous orders, that 251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access to existing entrance facilitiesi.e., transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect the two LECs networksbecause such facilities are not network elements at all.  The FCC noted, however, that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and backhauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent LECs 251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection.  Thus, the practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.


In 2005, following D.C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Remand Order.  The FCC retreated from the view that entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its previous position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities need not be provided under 251(c)(3).  Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to such facilities.  The FCC again emphasized that competitive LECs 251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnection had not been altered.


In the Remand Orders wake, respondent AT&T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates.  Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&T was unlawfully abrogating their 251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection.  The Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates.  AT&T challenged the ruling.  Relying on the Remand Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&Ts favor.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCCs argument that the order did not change incumbent LECs interconnection obligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.
Held:The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulationsi.e., that to satisfy its duty under 251(c)(2), an incumbent LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnectionand this Court defers to the FCCs views.  Pp. 616.
(a)No statute or regulation squarely addresses the question.  Pp. 67. 


(b)Absent an unambiguous statute or regulation, the Court turns to the FCCs interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief.  See, e.g., Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___.  The FCC proffers a three-step argument why its regulations require AT&T to provide access at cost-based rates to existing entrance facilities for interconnection purposes.  Pp. 710.


(1)Interpreting 47 CFR 51.321(a), the FCC first contends that an incumbent LEC must lease technically feasible facilities for interconnection.  Pp. 89.


(2)The FCC contends, second, that existing entrance facilities are part of an incumbent LECs network, 47 CFR 51.319(e), and therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease for interconnection, if technically feasible.  P. 9.


(3)Third, says the FCC, it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these casesa point AT&T does not dispute.  P. 10.


(c)Contrary to AT&Ts arguments, the FCCs interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  First, it is perfectly sensible to read the FCCs regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent LECs networks.  Second, the FCCs views do not conflict with 47 CFR 51.5s definition of interconnection as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and termination of traffic.  Pp. 1012.


(d)Nor is there any other reason to suspect that the [FCCs] in-terpretation does not reflect the agencys fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.  Auer, supra, at 462.  AT&T incorrectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under 251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under 251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Remand Order.  Pp. 1216.

S.C. 251(c)(3) requires an incumbent LEC to lease on an unbundled basisi.e., a la cartenetwork elements specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.  In identifying those elements, the FCC must consider whether access is necessary and whether failing to provide it would impair the competitors provision of service.  251(d)(2).  Second, 251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs provide  interconnection between their networks and competitive LECs to ensure that a competitors customers can call the incumbents customers, and vice versa.  The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.


In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, contrary to previous orders, that 251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access to existing entrance facilitiesi.e., transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect the two LECs networksbecause such facilities are not network elements at all.  The FCC noted, however, that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and backhauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent LECs 251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection.  Thus, the practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.


In 2005, following D.C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Remand Order.  The FCC retreated from the view that entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its previous position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities need not be provided under 251(c)(3).  Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to such facilities.  The FCC again emphasized that competitive LECs 251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnection had not been altered.


In the Remand Orders wake, respondent AT&T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates.  Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&T was unlawfully abrogating their 251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection.  The Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates.  AT&T challenged the ruling.  Relying on the Remand Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&Ts favor.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCCs argument that the order did not change incumbent LECs interconnection obligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.
Held:The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulationsi.e., that to satisfy its duty under 251(c)(2), an incumbent LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnectionand this Court defers to the FCCs views.  Pp. 616.
(a)No statute or regulation squarely addresses the question.  Pp. 67. 


(b)Absent an unambiguous statute or regulation, the Court turns to the FCCs interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief.  See, e.g., Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___.  The FCC proffers a three-step argument why its regulations require AT&T to provide access at cost-based rates to existing entrance facilities for interconnection purposes.  Pp. 710.


(1)Interpreting 47 CFR 51.321(a), the FCC first contends that an incumbent LEC must lease technically feasible facilities for interconnection.  Pp. 89.


(2)The FCC contends, second, that existing entrance facilities are part of an incumbent LECs network, 47 CFR 51.319(e), and therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease for interconnection, if technically feasible.  P. 9.


(3)Third, says the FCC, it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these casesa point AT&T does not dispute.  P. 10.


(c)Contrary to AT&Ts arguments, the FCCs interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  First, it is perfectly sensible to read the FCCs regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent LECs networks.  Second, the FCCs views do not conflict with 47 CFR 51.5s definition of interconnection as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and termination of traffic.  Pp. 1012.


(d)Nor is there any other reason to suspect that the [FCCs] in-terpretation does not reflect the agencys fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.  Auer, supra, at 462.  AT&T incorrectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under 251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under 251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Remand Order.  Pp. 1216.

			The Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, required incumbent local exchange carriers (""LECs""), providers of local telephone service, to share their physical networks with competitive LECs at cost-based rates. This suit arose when, in the wake of the Federal Communication Commission's (""FCC"") Triennial Review Remand Order, respondent notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates. At issue was whether an incumbent provider of local telephone services must make certain transmission facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates. The court held that the FCC had advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations, i.e., that to satisfy its duty under 47 U.S.C. 251(c)(2), an incumbent LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities were to be used for interconnection, and the Court deferred to the FCC's views.

10-568|"NEVADA COMMISSION ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 10568.Argued April 27, 2011Decided June 13, 2011
Nevadas Ethics in Government Law requires public officials to recuse themselves from voting on, or advocating the passage or failure of, a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in his situation would be materially affected by, inter alia, [h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others, Nev. Rev. Stat. 281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a commitment to a [specified] person, e.g., a member of the officers household or the officers relative, 281A.420(8)(a)(d), and [a]ny other commitment or relationship that is substantially similar to one enumerated in paragraphs (a)(d), 281A.420(8)(e).


Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevadas law.  The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a company that used Carrigans long-time friend and campaign manager as a paid consultant.  The Commission concluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of interest under 281A.420(8)(e)s catchall provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on the project.  Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Nevada law violated the First Amendment.  The State District Court denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding that voting is protected speech and that 281A.420(8)(e)s catchall definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.  
Held:The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  Pp.311.
(a)That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from voting on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure.  If it was constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitutional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.  See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293.  Pp.34.


(b)[A] universal and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is constitutional.  Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 785.  Here, dispositive evidence is provided by early congressional enactments, which offer contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitutions meaning, Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905.  Within 15 years of the founding, both the House and the Senate adopted recusal rules.  Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges also date back to the founding.  The notion that Nevadas recusal rules violate legislators First Amendment rights is also inconsistent with long-standing traditions in the States, most of which have some type of recusal law.  Pp.48.


(c)Restrictions on legislators voting are not restrictions on legislators protected speech.  A legislators vote is the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislatures power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.  He casts his vote as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 821.  Moreover, voting is not a symbolic action, and the fact that it is the product of a deeply held or highly unpopular personal belief does not transform it into First Amendment speech.  Even if the mere vote itself could express depth of belief (which it cannot), this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.  See, e.g., Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351.  Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___, distinguished.  Pp.810.

			Petitioner administered and enforced Nevada's Ethics in Government Law, Nev. Rev. Stat. 281A.420, and investigated respondent, an elected official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a company that used respondent's long-time friend and campaign manager as a paid consultant. Petitioner concluded that respondent had a disqualifying conflict of interest under section 281A.420(8)(e)'s catch-all provision and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on the project. At issue was whether legislators have a personal, First Amendment right to vote on any given matter. The Court held that the Nevada Ethics in Government Law was not unconstitutionally overbroad where the law prohibited a legislator who had a conflict both from voting on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure; where a universal and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain conduct created a strong presumption that the prohibition was constitutional; and where restrictions on legislators' voting were not restrictions on legislators' protected speech because the legislator's vote was the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature's power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal and the legislative power thus committed was not personal to the legislator but belonged to the people. The Court also concluded that additional arguments raised in respondent's brief were not decided or raised in his brief in opposition and were thus considered waived.

09-1156|"MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC., etal. v. SIRACUSANO etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 091156.Argued January 10, 2011Decided March 22, 2011
Respondents filed this securities fraud class action, alleging that petitioners (hereinafter Matrixx) violated 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5 by failing to disclose reports of a possible link between Matrixxs leading product, Zicam Cold Remedy, and loss of smell (anosmia), rendering statements made by Matrixx misleading.  Matrixx moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that respondents had not pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the element of scienter.  The District Court granted the motion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that the District Court erred in requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish materiality, concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged information linking Zicam and anosmia that would have been significant to a reasonable investor.  It also held that Matrixxs withholding of information about reports of adverse effects and about pending lawsuits by Zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.
Held:Respondents have stated a claim under 10(b) and Rule 10b5.  Pp.822.
(a)To prevail on their claim, respondents must prove, as relevant here, a material misrepresentation or omission by Matrixx and scienter.  See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157.  Matrixx contends that they failed to plead these required elements because they did not allege that the reports Matrixx received reflected statistically significant evidence that Zicam caused anosmia.  Pp.89. 


(b)Respondents have adequately pleaded materiality.  Pp.919.


(1)Under Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 10(b)s materiality requirement is satisfied when there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.  Id., at 231232.  The Court declined to adopt a bright-line rule for determining materiality in Basic, observing that [a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.  Id., at 236.  Here, Matrixxs bright-line rulethat adverse event reports regarding a pharmaceutical companys products are not material absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statistically significant risk that the product is causing the eventswould artificially exclud[e] information that would otherwise be considered significant to [a reasonable investors] trading decision.  Ibid.  Matrixxs premise that statistical significance is the only reliable indication of causation is flawed.  Both medical experts and the Food and Drug Administration rely on evidence other than statistically significant data to establish an inference of causation.  It thus stands to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence.  Because adverse reports can take many forms, assessing their materiality is a fact-specific inquiry, requiring consideration of their source, content, and context.  The question is whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.  Id., at 232.  Something more than the mere existence of adverse event reports is needed to satisfy that standard, but that something more is not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source, content, and context of the reports.  Pp.916.


(2)Applying Basics total mix standard here, respondents adequately pleaded materiality.  The complaints allegations suffice to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence satisfying the materiality requirement, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 556, and to allo[w] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Assuming the complaints allegations to be true, Matrixx received reports from medical experts and researchers that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between Zicam and anosmia.  Consumers likely would have viewed Zicams risk as substantially outweighing its benefit.  Viewing the complaints allegations as a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of Matrixxs leading product.  It is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.  Basic, supra, at 232.  Assuming the complaints allegations to be true, Matrixx told the market that revenues were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent when it had information indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating product.  It also publicly dismissed reports linking Zicam and anosmia and stated that zinc gluconates safety was well established, when it had evidence of a biological link between Zicams key ingredient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that link.  Pp.1619.


(c)Respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter, a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319.  This Court assumes, without deciding, that the scienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness.  Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a complaint adequately pleads scienter only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.  Id., at 324.  Matrixxs proposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed.  The complaints allegations, taken collectively, give rise to a cogent and compelling inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose adverse event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but because it understood their likely effect on the market.  Id., at 323, 324.  [A] reasonable person would deem the inference that Matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness at least as compelling as any [plausible] opposing inference.  Id., at 324.  Pp.1922.
585 F.3d 1167, affirmed.

10-5258|"McNEILL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 105258.Argued April 25, 2011Decided June 6, 2011
Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense.  As relevant here, a serious drug offense is defined as an offense under State law  , for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law, 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violating 922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for ACCAs sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North Carolina drug trafficking convictions.  When McNeill committed those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which McNeill in fact received.  However, because the State later reduced the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years, McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for serious drug offenses within the meaning of 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  The District Court rejected McNeills request that it look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the time he committed his state offenses.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.A federal sentencing court must determine whether an offense under State law is a serious drug offense by consulting the maximum term of imprisonment applicable to a defendants prior state drug offense at the time of the defendants conviction for that offense.  924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  Pp. 37.


(a)ACCAs plain text requires this result by mandating that the court determine whether a previous conviction was for a serious drug offense.  The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.  ACCAs use of the present tense in defining a serious drug offense as, inter alia, an offense  for which a maximum [10-year] term  is prescribed by law does not suggest otherwise.  McNeills argument that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing ignores ACCAs focus on convictions that have already occurred.  Pp. 34.


(b)The statutes broader context, specifically the adjacent definition of violent felony, confirms this interpretation.

			"|"McNEILL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 105258.Argued April 25, 2011Decided June 6, 2011
Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense.  As relevant here, a serious drug offense is defined as an offense under State law  , for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law, 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violating 922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for ACCAs sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North Carolina drug trafficking convictions.  When McNeill committed those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which McNeill in fact received.  However, because the State later reduced the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years, McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for serious drug offenses within the meaning of 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  The District Court rejected McNeills request that it look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the time he committed his state offenses.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.A federal sentencing court must determine whether an offense under State law is a serious drug offense by consulting the maximum term of imprisonment applicable to a defendants prior state drug offense at the time of the defendants conviction for that offense.  924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  Pp. 37.


(a)ACCAs plain text requires this result by mandating that the court determine whether a previous conviction was for a serious drug offense.  The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.  ACCAs use of the present tense in defining a serious drug offense as, inter alia, an offense  for which a maximum [10-year] term  is prescribed by law does not suggest otherwise.  McNeills argument that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing ignores ACCAs focus on convictions that have already occurred.  Pp. 34.


(b)The statutes broader context, specifically the adjacent definition of violent felony, confirms this interpretation.  Although Congress used the present tense in defining violent felony, see 924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in determining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.g., Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602.  The Court sees no reason to interpret serious drug offenses any differently.  Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp. 56.


(c)This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previous offense.  Pp. 67.

598 F.3d 161, affirmed.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."|"
			Defendant pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). At sentencing, the district court determined that defendant qualified for the Armed Career Criminal Act's (""ACCA"") sentencing enhancement and defendant conceded that two of his prior convictions were for ""violent felonies."" Defendant argued, however, that none of his six state drug trafficking convictions were for ""serious drug offenses"" because those crimes no longer carried a ""maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more"" pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(1). At issue was how a federal court should determine the maximum sentence for a prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes. The Court held that the ""maximum term of imprisonment"" for a defendant's prior state drug offense was the maximum sentence applicable to his offense when he was convicted of it where the ACCA's plain text required this result by mandating that the court determine whether a ""previous conviction"" was for a serious drug offense and where the ACCA's broader context confirmed this interpretation. Accordingly, the district court properly applied ACCA's sentencing enhancement to defendant because all of his six prior drug convictions were for ""serious drug offenses.""

SYSTEMS, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 091159.Argued February 28, 2011Decided June 6, 2011
In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.  A Nobel Prize winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral part of these efforts. 


In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford Universitys Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs.  Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.  When he did so, he signed an agreement stating that he agree[d] to assign to Stanford his right, title and interest in inventions resulting from his employment there.  Holodniys supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus to learn about PCR.  As a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he will assign and do[es] hereby assign to Cetus his right, title and interest in  the ideas, inventions, and improvements made as a consequence of [his] access to Cetus.  Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount of HIV in a patients blood.  Upon returning to Stanford, he and other Stanford employees tested the procedure.  Stanford secured three patents to the measurement process.


Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetuss PCR-related assets.  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure.  Today, its HIV test kits are used worldwide.


The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded subject invention[s] between the Federal Government and federal contractors.  35 U. S.C. 201(e), (c), 202(a).  The Act defines subject invention as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement, 201(e), and provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention, 202(a).  Because some of Stanfords research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.  In accordance with the Acts requirements, Stanford notified NIH that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the Government a license to use the patented procedure. 


Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits infringed Stanfords patents.  Roche responded that Holodniys agreement with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.  Stanford countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the University had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The District Court agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holodniy had no rights to assign to Cetus.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniys agreement with Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche.  It also found that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventors rights in federally funded inventions.  Thus, the Act did not extinguish Roches ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was deprived of standing. 
Held:The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions.  Pp.615.
(a)Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.  See, e.g., Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 493.  In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor, orbecause an inventors interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writingan inventors assignee.  See United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178, 187.  Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not have rights in an invention which is the original conception of the employee alone, id., at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those rights to his employer, see id., at 187.  Pp.68.


(b)Stanford and amicus United States contend that, when an invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the inventors employerthe federal contractor.  Congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified federal contracts become the Governments property.  Such unambiguous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act.  Instead, the Act provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention, 202(a), defining a subject invention as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement, 201(e). 


Stanford contends that invention of the contractor means all inventions that a contractors employees make with the aid of federal funds.  That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.  This Court has rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employees invention in the employer. Stanfords reading also renders the phrase of the contractor superfluous since the definition already covers inventions made under a funding agreement.  Construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreementinventions of the contractor, that is, those owned by or belonging to the contractormakes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.  And invention owned by the contractor or invention belonging to the contractor are natural readings of the phrase invention of the contractor. 


Section 202(a), which states that contractors may elect to retain title, confirms that the Act does not vest title.  Stanford reaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads retain to mean acquire and receive.  That is certainly not the common meaning of retain, which is to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.  You cannot retain something unless you already have it.  And 210(a)which provides that the Act take[s] precedence over any other Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions  that is inconsistent with the Actdoes not displace the basic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.  Only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into play.  The Acts disposition of rights does nothing more than clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor. 


The Acts isolated provisions dealing with inventors rights in subject inventions are consistent with the Courts construction of the Act.  See 202(d).  That construction is also bolstered by the Acts limited procedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to challenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention, 202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for inventor and third-party rights. 


Stanfords contrary construction would permit title to an employees inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the inventions reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.  It also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar of federal funding applied toward an inventions conception or reduction to practice.  It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.  To do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.  Had Congress intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearlynot obliquely through an ambiguous definition of subject invention and an idiosyncratic use of the word retain. 


The Courts construction of the Act is also reflected in the common practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.  With effective assignments, federally funded inventions become subject inventions and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should.  The only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own their inventions.  Pp.815.

10-114|"FOX v. VICE, as executrix of the ESTATE OF VICE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 10114.Argued March 22, 2011Decided June 6, 2011
Claiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful campaign to become the police chief of Vinton, La., petitioner Fox filed a state-court suit against Vice, the incumbent chief, and the town (Vice, for short).  Foxs suit asserted both state-law claims, including defamation, and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S.C. 1983, including interference with Foxs right to seek public office.  Vice removed the case to federal court based on the 1983 claims.  After discovery, he sought summary judgment on the federal claims, which Fox conceded were not valid.  The District Court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims to state court, noting that Vices attorneys work could be useful in the state-court proceedings.  Vice then asked the federal court for attorneys fees under 1988, submitting attorney billing records estimating the time spent on the entire suit, without differentiating between time spent on the now-dismissed federal claims and on the remaining state claims.  The court granted the motion on the ground that Foxs federal claims were frivolous, awarding Fox fees for all work his attorneys had performed in the suit.  Although the state-law allegations had not been found frivolous, the court did not require Vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets of claims.  It also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the surviving state-law claims, noting that both sides had focused on the frivolous 1983 claims.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Foxs argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defendant to recover any fees, and agreeing with the District Court that the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.
Held: 
1.When a plaintiffs suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims.  Pp.511. 


(a)Section 1988 allows the award of a reasonable attorneys fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights cases, including 1983 suits.  While most of this Courts 1988 decisions have concerned fees to prevailing plaintiffs, 1988 also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421.  Just as plaintiffs may receive fees under 1988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed for costs under 1988 even if the plaintiffs suit is not wholly frivolous, ibid., n.10.  The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from these non-frivolous charges, see Christiansburg, 434 U. S., at 420421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.  Pp.57.


(b)The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Congresss purpose in enacting 1988to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigationpoints to the proper standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorneys fees incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; i.e., 1988 permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim.  A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defendants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely because the plaintiffs suit also included frivolous claims.  This but-for standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work because of the defendants greater financial exposure on that claim.  The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous allegation.  The answers to those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge, it is the second one that matters.  The determination of fees should not result in a second major litigation.  Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.  The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.  The trial court has wide discretion, but must apply the correct but-for standard.  And the appeals court must determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for question, rather than some other.  Pp.711.


2.The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to Vice.  The District Courts analysis suggests that Vices attorneys would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous claims.  The charges arose out of Vices conduct in the campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to the non-frivolous state-law claims, his defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.  It thus seems likely that Vices attorneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions.  Although the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys work in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper account of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Its reasoningthat the close relationship between the federal and state-law claims supported the awardcannot be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of frivolous litigation.  Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on the proper ground.  It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers would have done that work regardless.  On this record, the case must be returned to the lower courts.  Pp.1213.
594 F.3d 423, vacated and remanded.
Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

While most of this Courts 1988 decisions have concerned fees to prevailing plaintiffs, 1988 also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421.  Just as plaintiffs may receive fees under 1988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed for costs under 1988 even if the plaintiffs suit is not wholly frivolous, ibid., n.10.  The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from these non-frivolous charges, see Christiansburg, 434 U. S., at 420421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.  Pp.57.


(b)The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Congresss purpose in enacting 1988to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigationpoints to the proper standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorneys fees incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; i.e., 1988 permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim.  A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defendants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely because the plaintiffs suit also included frivolous claims.  This but-for standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work because of the defendants greater financial exposure on that claim.  The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous allegation.  The answers to those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge, it is the second one that matters.  The determination of fees should not result in a second major litigation.  Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.  The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.  The trial court has wide discretion, but must apply the correct but-for standard.  And the appeals court must determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for question, rather than some other.  Pp.711.


2.The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to Vice.  The District Courts analysis suggests that Vices attorneys would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous claims.  The charges arose out of Vices conduct in the campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to the non-frivolous state-law claims, his defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.  It thus seems likely that Vices attorneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions.  Although the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys work in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper account of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Its reasoningthat the close relationship between the federal and state-law claims supported the awardcannot be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of frivolous litigation.  Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on the proper ground.  It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers would have done that work regardless.  On this record, the case must be returned to the lower courts.  Pp.1213.
594 F.3d 423, vacated and remanded.
Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."|"
			Claiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful campaign to become the police chief of Vinton, La., plaintiff filed a state court suit against the incumbent chief and the town (collectively, ""defendant"") asserting both state and federal law claims. Defendant removed the case to federal court based on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. 1983 claims and after discovery, defendant sought summary judgment on the federal claims, which plaintiff conceded were not valid. The District Court accordingly dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims to state court, noting that defendant's attorneys' work could be useful in the state court proceedings. Defendant then asked the federal court for attorney's fees. At issue was whether a court could grant reasonable fees to defendant when plaintiff's suit involved both frivolous and non-frivolous claims. The Court held that, when a plaintiff's suit involved both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a court could grant reasonable fees to defendant, but only for costs that defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims. The Court concluded that, although the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys' work in defending against the state law claims, it failed to take proper account of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims; the District Court's reasoning that the close relationship between the federal and state law claims supported the award could not be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendant from the costs only of frivolous litigation; and the Fifth Circuit did not uphold the award on proper ground where it seemed to think that defendant could receive fees for any work useful to defendant against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers would have done that work regardless. Accordingly, the court vacated and remanded for further proceedings.

09-1403|"ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING FUND, INC. v.
HALLIBURTON CO. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 091403.Argued April 25, 2011Decided June 6, 2011
Petitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton).  EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate the companys stock price, in violation of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5.  EPJ Fund also contends that Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures that caused the stock price to drop and, consequently, investors to lose money.  EPJ Fund sought to have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  The District Court found that the suit could proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Fifth Circuit precedent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove loss causationi.e., that the defendants deceptive conduct caused the investors claimed economic lossin order to obtain class certification.  The District Court concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to satisfy that requirement.  The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the denial of class certification.
Held:Securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation in order to obtain class certification.  Pp.310.
(a)In order to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a court must find that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.  Considering whether questions of law or fact common to class members predominate begins, of course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action.  The elements of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of 10(b) and Rule 10b5 are: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___, ___. 


Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in such an action often turns on the element of reliance.  The traditional way a plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a companys statement and engaged in a relevant transactione.g., purchasing common stockbased on that specific misrepresentation.  The Court recognized in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, however, that [r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would prevent such plaintiffs from proceeding with a class action, since individual issues would overwhelm[ ] the common ones.  Id., at 242.  The Court in Basic sought to alleviate that concern by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known as the fraud-on-the-market theory.  According to that theory, the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.  Id., at 246.  Under that doctrine, the Court explained, one can assume an investor relies on public misstatements whenever he buys or sells stock at the price set by the market.  Id., at 247.  The Court also made clear that the presumption could be rebutted by appropriate evidence.  Pp.35.


(b)It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basics rebuttable presumption of reliance.  According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund had to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to trigger the presumption.  That requirement is not justified by Basic or its logic.  This Court has never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basics rebuttable presumption.  Loss causation addresses a matter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.


The Court has referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule 10b5 action as transaction causation, not loss causation.  Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341342.  Consistent with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied on a misrepresentation, the Court has typically focused on facts surrounding the investors decision to engage in the transaction.  Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepresentation caused a subsequent economic loss.  That has nothing to do with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory.  The Court of Appeals rule contravenes Basics fundamental premisethat an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.  Pp.58.


(c)Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke Basics presumption of reliance.  Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually require EPJ Fund to prove loss causation as the Court has used that term.  According to Halliburton, loss causation was shorthand for a different analysis.  The lower courts actual inquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated price impactthat is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first place. 


The Court does not accept EPJ Funds interpretation of the Court of Appeals opinion.  Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities law; it is not price impact.  Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.  The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word.  Based on those words, the decision below cannot stand.  Pp.89.
597 F.3d 330, vacated and remanded.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

10-6|"GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC., etal. v. SEB S.A.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 106.Argued February 23, 2011Decided May 31, 2011
After respondent SEB invented an innovative deep fryer, obtained a U. S. patent for its design, and began selling its fryer in this country, Sunbeam Products, Inc., asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., a Hong Kong home appliance maker and wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Appliances, Inc., to supply Sunbeam with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.  Pentalpha purchased an SEB fryer that was made for sale in a foreign market and thus lacked U. S. patent markings, copied all but the fryers cosmetic features, and retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use study without telling him it had copied directly from SEBs design.  Failing to locate SEBs patent, the attorney issued an opinion letter stating that Pentalphas deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had found.  Pentalpha then started selling its fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in this country under its own trademarks at a price that undercut SEBs.
  SEB then sued Sunbeam for patent infringement.  Though Sunbeam notified Pentalpha of the lawsuit, Pentalpha went on to sell its fryers to other companies, which resold them in the U. S. market under their respective trademarks.  After settling the Sunbeam lawsuit, SEB sued Pentalpha, asserting, as relevant here, that it had contravened 35 U. S.C. 271(b) by actively inducing Sunbeam and the other purchasers of Pentalpha fryers to sell or offer to sell them in violation of SEBs patent rights.  The jury found for SEB on the induced infringement theory, and the District Court entered judgment for SEB.  Affirming, the Federal Circuit stated that induced infringement under 271(b) requires a showing that the alleged infringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce actual infringements; declared that this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer knew of the patent; held that, although there was no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of SEBs patent before it received notice of the Sunbeam suit, there was adequate proof that it deliberately disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective patent; and said that such disregard is not different from, but a form of, actual knowledge.
Held:
1.Induced infringement under 271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.  Pp. 310.
  (a)Section 271(b)s text[w]hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringeris ambiguous as to the intent needed to impose liability.  In referring to a party that induces infringement, the provision may require merely that the inducer must lead another to engage in conduct that happens to amount to infringement.  On the other hand, the reference to a party that induces infringement may also be read to mean that the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer knows is infringement.  Pp. 45.
  (b)Like 271(b)s language, the pre-1952 case law is susceptible to conflicting interpretations.  However, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476 (Aro II), resolves the question at issue.  Pp. 58.
  (c)Induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of indirect liability in the pre-1952 case law, but was treated as evidence of contributory infringement, i.e., the aiding and abetting of direct infringement by another party.  When Congress enacted 271, it separated the contributory infringement concept into two categories: induced infringement, covered by 271(b), and sale of a component of a patented invention, covered by 271(c).  In the badly fractured Aro II decision, a majority concluded that a violator of 271(c) must know that the combination for which his component was especially designed was both patented and infringing.  377 U. S., at 488.  That conclusion, now a fixture in the law, compels this same knowledge for liability under 271(b), given that the two provisions have a common origin and create the same difficult interpretive choice.  Pp. 810.
  2.Deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does not satisfy the knowledge required by 271(b).  Nevertheless, the Federal Circuits judgment must be affirmed because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalphas knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness.  Pp. 1016.
  (a)The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in criminal law.  Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts applying the doctrine have held that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.  The traditional rationale for the doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.  This Court endorsed a concept similar to willful blindness over a century ago in Spurr v. United States, 174 U. S. 728, 735, and every Federal Court of Appeals but one has fully embraced willful blindness.  Given the doctrine's long history and wide acceptance in the Federal Judiciary, there is no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for induced patent infringement under 271(b).  Pp. 1013.
  (b)Although the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of willful blindness in slightly different ways, all agree on two basic requirements.  First, the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists.  Second, the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.  These requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.  Pp.1314.
  (c)Although the Federal Circuits test departs from the proper willful blindness standard in important respects, the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for SEB was sufficient under the correct standard.  Pentalpha believed that SEBs fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the U. S. market as evidenced by its decision to copy all but the fryers cosmetic features.  Also revealing is Pentalphas decision to copy an overseas model of SEBs fryer, aware that it would not bear U. S. patent markings.  Even more telling is Pentalphas decision not to inform its attorney that the product to be evaluated was simply a knockoff of SEBs fryer.  Taken together, the evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed there was a high probability that SEBs fryer was patented and took deliberate steps to avoid knowing that fact, and that it therefore willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of Sunbeams sales.  Pp. 1416.
594 F.3d 1360, affirmed.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

10-98|"ASHCROFT v. al-KIDD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 1098.Argued March 2, 2011Decided May 31, 2011
Respondent al-Kidd alleges that, after the September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft authorized federal officials to detain terrorism suspects using the federal material-witness statute, 18 U. S.C. 3144.  He claims that this pretextual detention policy led to his material-witness arrest as he was boarding a plane to Saudi Arabia.  To secure the warrant, federal officials had told a Magistrate Judge that information crucial to Sami Omar al-Hussayens prosecution would be lost if al-Kidd boarded his flight.  Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and (as he alleges) never meant to do so.  Al-Kidd filed suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, challenging the constitutionality of Ashcrofts alleged policy.  The District Court denied Ashcrofts motion to dismiss on absolute and qualified immunity grounds.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or absolute immunity.
Held: 
1.The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive.  Pp.39.


(a)Qualified immunity shields a government official from money damages unless (1) the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818.  Where, as here, a court considers both prongs of this inquiry, this Court has the discretion to correct the lower courts errors at each step.  P.3.


(b)Whether a detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment is predominantly an objective inquiry.  Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 47.  Courts ask whether the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action.  Scott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138.  Except for cases that involve special-needs, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653, or administrative searches, e.g., Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U. S. 287, 294, this Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent.  The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that Edmond established that programmatic purpose is relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without probable cause.  580 F.3d 949, 968.  It was not the absence of probable cause that triggered Edmonds invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the checkpoints failure to be based on individualized suspicion.  531 U. S., at 47.  Here a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing al-Kidds arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the warrant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness who would soon disappear.  A warrant based on individualized suspicion grants more protection than existed in most of this Courts cases eschewing inquiries into intent, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, and Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 2122.  Al-Kidds contrary, narrow reading of those cases is rejected.  Because he concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issuance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretext; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here.  Pp.39.


2.Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is entitled to qualified immunity.  A Government officials conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, [t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640.  Here, the asserted constitutional right falls far short of that threshold.  At the time of al-Kidds arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant unconstitutional.  The Ninth Circuits reliance on a District Courts footnoted dictum, irrelevant cases from this Court, and the Fourth Amendments broad purposes and history is rejected.  Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, the question whether he enjoys absolute immunity need not be addressed.  Pp.912.
580 F.3d 949, reversed and remanded.

09-115|"CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA etal. v. WHITING etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09115.Argued December 8, 2010Decided May 26, 2011
The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) makes it unlawful for a person or other entity  to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.  8 U. S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A).  Employers that violate that prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal sanctions.  IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat employment of unauthorized workers; the Act expressly preempts any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.  1324a(h)(2).


IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employees eligibility for employment.  In an attempt to improve that verification process in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Congress created E-Verifyan internet-based system employers can use to check the work authorization status of employees.


Against this statutory background, several States have recently enacted laws attempting to impose sanctions for the employment of unauthorized aliens through, among other things, licensing and similar laws.  Arizona is one of them.  The Legal Arizona Workers Act provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, suspended or revoked.  That law also requires that all Arizona employers use E-Verify.


The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various business and civil rights organizations (collectively Chamber) filed this federal preenforcement suit against those charged with administering the Arizona law, arguing that the state laws license suspension and revocation provisions were both expressly and impliedly preempted by federal immigration law, and that the mandatory use of E-Verify was impliedly preempted.  The District Court found that the plain language of IRCAs preemption clause did not invalidate the Arizona law because the law did no more than impose licensing conditions on businesses operating within the State.  Nor was the state law preempted with respect to E-Verify, the court concluded, because although Congress had made the program voluntary at the national level, it had expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating participation.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
558 F.3d 856, affirmed.
The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and IIA, concluding that Arizonas licensing law is not expressly preempted.


Arizonas licensing law falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not expressly preempted.  While IRCA prohibits States from imposing civil or criminal sanctions on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it preserves state authority to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws.  1324a(h)(2).  That is what the Arizona law doesit instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state employers that employ unauthorized aliens.  The definition of license contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition of license that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).


The state statute also includes within its definition of license documents such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact business in the State, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23211(9), each of which has clear counterparts in APA and dictionary definitions of the word license.  And even if a law regulating articles of incorporation and the like is not itself a licensing law, it is at the very least similar to one, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause.  The Chambers argument that the Arizona law is not a licensing law because it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to grant them is without basis in law, fact, or logic.


The Chamber contends that the savings clause should apply only to certain types of licenses or only to license revocation following an IRCA adjudication because Congress, when enacting IRCA, eliminated unauthorized worker prohibitions and associated adjudication procedures in another federal statute.  But no such limits are even remotely discernible in the statutory text.


The Chambers reliance on IRCAs legislative history to bolster its textual and structural arguments is unavailing given the Courts conclusion that Arizonas law falls within the plain text of the savings clause.  Pp. 915.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IIB:


The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal law.  At its broadest, the Chambers argument is that Congress intended the federal system to be exclusive.  But Arizonas procedures simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the States to pursue through licensing laws.  Given that Congress specifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise that authority.


And here Arizonas law closely tracks IRCAs provisions in all material respects.  For example, it adopts the federal definition of who qualifies as an unauthorized alien, compare 8 U. S.C. 1324a(h)(3) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23211(11); provides that state investigators must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Government, making no independent determination of the matter, 23212(B); and requires a state court to consider only the federal governments determination, 23212(H).


The Chambers more general contention that the Arizona law is preempted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to strike in IRCA also fails.  The cases on which the Chamber relies in making this argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest, see, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341.  Regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not such an area.  And those cases all concern state actions that directly interfered with the operation of a federal program, see, e.g., id., at 351.  There is no similar interference here.


The Chamber asserts that employers will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk the business death penalty by hiring unauthorized workers.  That is not the choice.  License termination is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized workers, but is triggered only by far more egregious violations.  And because the Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional violations, an employer acting in good faith need not fear the laws sanctions.  Moreover, federal and state antidiscrimination laws protect against employment discrimination and provide employers with a strong incentive not to discriminate.  Employers also enjoy safe harbors from liability when using E-Verify as required by the Arizona law.  The most rational path for employers is to obey both the law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibiting discrimination.  There is no reason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not to do so.  Pp. 1522.


The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part IIIA, concluding that Arizonas E-Verify mandate is not impliedly preempted.


Arizonas requirement that employers use E-Verify is not impliedly preempted.  The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no language circumscribing state action.  It does, however, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may not require any person or   entity outside the Federal Government to participate in E-Verify.  IIRIRA, 402(a), (e).  The fact that the Federal Government may require the use of E-Verify in only limited circumstances says nothing about what the States may do.  The Government recently argued just that in another case and approvingly referenced Arizonas law as an example of a permissible use of E-Verify when doing so.


Moreover, Arizonas use of E-Verify does not conflict with the federal scheme.  The state law requires no more than that an employer, after hiring an employee, verify the employment eligibility of the employee through E-Verify.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23214(A).  And the consequences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state and federal lawan employer forfeits an otherwise available rebuttable presumption of compliance with the law.  Pp. 2324.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IIIB:


Arizonas requirement that employers use E-Verify in no way obstructs achieving the aims of the federal program.  In fact, the Government has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of E-Verify, and Congress has directed that E-Verify be made available in all 50 States.  And the Government has expressly rejected the Chambers claim that the Arizona law, and those like it, will overload the federal system.  Pp. 2425.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts IIB and IIIB.  Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Thomas, J., joined as to Parts I, IIA, and IIIA and concurred in the judgment.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

09-1498|"UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 091498.Argued February 22, 2011Decided May 26, 2011
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) provides, inter alia, that in any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial  shall commence within seventy days after the arraignment, 18 U. S.C. 3161(c)(1), but lists a number of exclusions from the 70-day period, including delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion, 3161(h)(1)(D).


Respondent Tinklenbergs trial on federal drug and gun charges began 287 days after his arraignment.  The District Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial violated the Acts 70-day requirement, finding that 218 of the days fell within various of the Acts exclusions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thus making the trial timely.  On Tinklenbergs appeal from his conviction, the Sixth Circuit agreed that many of the 287 days were excludable, but concluded that 9 days during which three pretrial motions were pending were not, because the motions did not actually cause a delay, or the expectation of delay, of trial.  Since these 9 days were sufficient to bring the number of nonexcludable days above 70, the court found a violation of the Act.  And given that Tinklenberg had already served his prison sentence, it ordered the indictment dismissed with prejudice.
Held: 
1.The Act contains no requirement that the filing of a pretrial motion actually caused, or was expected to cause, delay of a trial.  Rather, 3161(h)(1)(D) stops the Speedy Trial clock from running automatically upon the filing of a pretrial motion irrespective of whether the motion has any impact on when the trial begins.  Pp. 312.


(a)The Sixth Circuit reasoned that subparagraph (D)s delay resulting from phrase, read most naturally, requires a court to apply the exclusion provision only to motions that actually cause a trial delay, or the expectation of such a delay.  While such a reading is linguistically reasonable, it is not the only reasonable interpretation.  The subparagraph falls within a general set of provisions introduced by the phrase: The following periods of delay shall be excluded.  3161(h).  That phrase is followed by a list that includes [a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including.  3161(h)(1).  This latter list is followed by a sublist, each member (but one) of which is introduced by the phrase delay resulting from  .  Ibid.  Those words are followed by a more specific description, such as any pretrial motion from its filing through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.  3161(h)(1)(D).  The whole paragraph can be read as requiring the automatic exclusion of the members of that specific sublist, while referring to those members in general as periods of delay and as causing that delay, not because Congress intended the judge to determine causation, but because, in a close to definitional way, the words embody Congress own view of the matter.  Thus, language alone cannot resolve the basic question presented.  Pp. 47. 


(c)Several considerations, taken together, compel the conclusion that Congress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.  First, subparagraph (D) and neighboring subparagraphs (F) and (H) contain language that instructs courts to measure the time actually consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence, but those subparagraphs do not mention the date on which the trial begins or was expected to begin.  Second, during the 37 years since Congress enacted the statute, every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Sixth Circuits interpretation.  Third, the Sixth Circuits interpretation would make the subparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to administer, thereby hindering the Acts efforts to secure fair and efficient trials.  Fourth, the Courts conclusion is reinforced by the difficulty of squaring the Sixth Circuits interpretation with the automatic application rule expressed in, e.g., Henderson v. United States, 476 U. S. 321, 327.  Fifth, the legislative history also supports the Courts conclusion.  Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one under paragraph (1) begin with the phrase delay resulting from, the Sixth Circuits interpretation would potentially extend well beyond pretrial motions and encompass such matters as mental and physical competency examinations, interlocutory appeals, consideration of plea agreements, and the absence of essential witnesses.  Pp. 712.


2.The Sixth Circuit also misinterpreted 3161(h)(1)(F), which excludes from the 70-day calculation delay resulting from transportation of any defendant  to and from places of examination  , except that any time consumed in excess of ten days  shall be presumed to be unreasonable.  The lower courts agreed that a total of 20 transportation days had elapsed when Tinklenberg was evaluated for competency, and that because the Government provided no justification, all days in excess of the 10 days specified in the statute were unreasonable.  However, the Sixth Circuit exempted 8 weekend days and holidays from the count on the theory that subparagraph (F) incorporated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a), which, at the time, excluded such days when computing any period specified in rules and court order[s] that was less than 11 days.  Thus, the Circuit considered only two transportation days excessive, and the parties concede that the eight extra days were enough to make the difference between compliance with, and violation of, the Act.


This Court exercises its discretion to consider the subsidiary subparagraph (F) question because doing so is fairer to Tinklenberg, who has already served his sentence.  In the Courts view, subparagraph (F) does not incorporate Rule 45.  The Act does not say that it does so, the Government gives no good reason for such a reading, and the Rule itself, as it existed at the relevant time, stated it applied to rules and court orders, but said nothing about statutes.  The fact that Rule 45 is revised from time to time also argues against its direct application to subparagraph (F) because such changes, likely reflecting considerations other than those related to the Act, may well leave courts treating similar defendants differently.  The better reading includes weekend days and holidays in subparagraph (F)s 10-day period under the common-law rule that such days are included when counting a statutory time period of 10 days unless a statute specifically excludes them.  Many courts have treated statutory time periods this way, and Congress has tended specifically to exclude weekend days and holidays from statutory time periods of 10 days when it intended that result.  Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently modified to require a similar result.  Pp.  1214. 


3.Althoughthe Sixth Circuits interpretations of subparagraphs (D) and (F) are both mistaken, the conclusions the court drew from its interpretations in relevant part cancel each other out, such that the courts ultimate conclusion that Tinklenbergs trial failed to comply with the Acts deadline is correct.  Pp. 1415.

			"|"UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 091498.Argued February 22, 2011Decided May 26, 2011
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) provides, inter alia, that in any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial  shall commence within seventy days after the arraignment, 18 U. S.C. 3161(c)(1), but lists a number of exclusions from the 70-day period, including delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion, 3161(h)(1)(D).


Respondent Tinklenbergs trial on federal drug and gun charges began 287 days after his arraignment.  The District Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial violated the Acts 70-day requirement, finding that 218 of the days fell within various of the Acts exclusions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thus making the trial timely.  On Tinklenbergs appeal from his conviction, the Sixth Circuit agreed that many of the 287 days were excludable, but concluded that 9 days during which three pretrial motions were pending were not, because the motions did not actually cause a delay, or the expectation of delay, of trial.  Since these 9 days were sufficient to bring the number of nonexcludable days above 70, the court found a violation of the Act.  And given that Tinklenberg had already served his prison sentence, it ordered the indictment dismissed with prejudice.

09-1233|"BROWN, GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, etal. v. PLATA etal.
appeal from the united states district courts for the eastern and northern districts of california
No. 091233.Argued November 30, 2010Decided May 23, 2011
Californias prisons are designed to house a population just under 80,000, but at the time of the decision under review the population was almost double that.  The resulting conditions are the subject of two federal class actions.  In Coleman v. Brown, filed in 1990, the District Court found that prisoners with serious mental illness do not receive minimal, adequate care.  A Special Master appointed to oversee remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental health care in Californias prisons was deteriorating due to increased overcrowding.  In Plata v. Brown, filed in 2001, the State conceded that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners Eighth Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction.  But when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts.  Three years later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by overcrowding.  Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding, the Coleman and Plata plaintiffs moved their respective District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in the prison population.  The judges in both actions granted the request, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge court.  After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact, the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity within two years.  Finding that the prison population would have to be reduced if capacity could not be increased through new construction, the court ordered the State to formulate a compliance plan and submit it for court approval.
Held: 
1.The court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners constitutional rights and is authorized by the PLRA.  Pp.1241.


(a)If a prison deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, the courts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 687, n.9.  They must consider a range of options, including the appointment of special masters or receivers, the possibility of consent decrees, and orders limiting a prisons population.  Under the PLRA, only a three-judge court may limit a prison population.  18 U. S.C. 3626(a)(3).  Before convening such a court, a district court must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that failed to remedy the constitutional violation and must have given the defendant a reasonable time to comply with its prior orders.  3626(a)(3)(A).  Once convened, the three-judge court must find by clear and convincing evidence that crowding is the primary cause of the violation and no other relief will remedy [the] violation, 3626(a)(3)(E); and that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation, 3626(a)(1)(A).  The court must give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.  Ibid.  Its legal determinations are reviewed de novo, but its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.  Pp.1215.


(b)The Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably in convening a three-judge court.  Pp.1519.


(1)The merits of the decision to convene are properly before this Court, which has exercised its 28 U. S.C. 1253 jurisdiction to determine the authority of a court below, including whether a three-judge court was properly constituted.  Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n.12. Pp.1516.


(2)Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)s previous order requirement was satisfied in Coleman by the Special Masters 1995 appointment and in Plata by the 2002 approval of a consent decree and stipulated injunction.  Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional violations and were given ample time to succeed12 years in Coleman, and 5 years in Plata.  Contrary to the States claim, 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)s reasonable time requirement did not require the District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to succeed.  Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit, which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts involvement, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners.  The Coleman and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given the ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master and the Receiver.  Pp.1619.


(c)The three-judge court did not err in finding that crowding [was] the primary cause of the violation, 3626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Pp.1929.


(1)The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning demand on the provision of care.  The evidence showed that there were high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, e.g., 20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers understated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions could be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional staff.  Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating mentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation for extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds.  There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see a doctor for physical care.  Crowding creates unsafe and unsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and mental health care.  It also promotes unrest and violence and can cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.  Increased violence requires increased reliance on lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective delivery of care.  Overcrowdings effects are particularly acute in prison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning prisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire incarceration period.  Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary cause of the constitutional violations.  Pp.1924.


(2)Contrary to the States claim, the three-judge court properly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison conditions as relevant to the issues before it.  Expert witnesses based their conclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court admitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Special Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current conditions.  The courts orders cutting off discovery a few months before trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the courts sound discretion.  Orderly trial management may require discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the merits and the remedy.  The State points to no significant evidence that it was unable to present and that would have changed the outcome here.  Pp.2426.


(3)It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that overcrowding was the primary, but not the only, cause of the violations, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the violations.  This understanding of the primary cause requirement is consistent with the PLRA.  Had Congress intended to require that crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so.  Pp.2629.


(d)The evidence supports the three-judge courts finding that no other relief [would] remedy the violation, 3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).  The States claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers is a population limit under the PLRA.  Even if they could be regarded as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve overcrowding.  The court also found no realistic possibility that California could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the States ongoing fiscal problems.  Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realistic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.  The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population reduction, the Receivers and Special Masters continued efforts would not achieve a remedy.  Their reports are persuasive evidence that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State.  The State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evidence of overcrowdings deleterious effects on the provision of care, compels a different conclusion here.  Pp.2933.


(e)The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation.  Pp.3341.


(1)The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required reduction.  While narrow tailoring requires a fit between the [remedys] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends, Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480, a narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not invalid simply because it will have collateral effects.  Nor does the PLRA require that result.  The order gives the State flexibility to determine who should be released, and the State could move the three-judge court to modify its terms.  The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than separately assessing each institutions need for a population limit.  The Coleman court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated to systemwide relief in Plata.  Assuming no constitutional violation results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5% limit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the order.  This will afford the State flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.  The order may shape or control the States authority in the realm of prison administration, but it leaves much to the States discretion.  The orders limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional violation.  The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order, but it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.  Pp.3336.


(2)The three-judge court gave substantial weight to any potential adverse impact on public safety from its order.  The PLRAs substantial weight requirement does not require the court to certify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public.  Here, statistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered without adversely affecting public safety in some California counties, several States, and Canada.  The court found that various available methods of reducing overcrowdinggood time credits and diverting low-risk offenders to community programswould have little or no impact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns by giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means of reducing overcrowding.  The State complains that the court approved the States population reduction plan without considering whether its specific measures would substantially threaten public safety.  But the court left state officials the choice of how best to comply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.  Developments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State has begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion that a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative effect on public safety.  Pp.3741.


2.The three-judge courts order, subject to the States right to seek its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.  Pp.4148. 


(a)To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit at the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it must order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably consistent with public safety.  Pp.4142.


(b)The three-judge courts conclusion that the prison population should be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly erroneous.  The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit between the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State Corrections Independent Review Panel.  The PLRAs narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judgments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy.  Pp.4244.


(c)The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year deadline for relief, especially in light of the States failure to contest the issue at trial.  The State has not asked this Court to extend the deadline, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility, to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.  Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes require that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public safety.  The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that the plan will be implemented without undue delay.  Such observations reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the orders basic premise.  Pp.4448.

Contrary to the States claim, 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)s reasonable time requirement did not require the District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to succeed.  Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit, which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts involvement, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners.  The Coleman and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given the ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master and the Receiver.  Pp.1619.


(c)The three-judge court did not err in finding that crowding [was] the primary cause of the violation, 3626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Pp.1929.


(1)The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning demand on the provision of care.  The evidence showed that there were high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, e.g., 20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers understated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions could be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional staff.  Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating mentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation for extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds.  There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see a doctor for physical care.  Crowding creates unsafe and unsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and mental health care.  It also promotes unrest and violence and can cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.  Increased violence requires increased reliance on lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective delivery of care.  Overcrowdings effects are particularly acute in prison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning prisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire incarceration period.  Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary cause of the constitutional violations.  Pp.1924.


(2)Contrary to the States claim, the three-judge court properly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison conditions as relevant to the issues before it.  Expert witnesses based their conclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court admitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Special Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current conditions.  The courts orders cutting off discovery a few months before trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the courts sound discretion.  Orderly trial management may require discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the merits and the remedy.  The State points to no significant evidence that it was unable to present and that would have changed the outcome here.  Pp.2426.


(3)It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that overcrowding was the primary, but not the only, cause of the violations, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the violations.  This understanding of the primary cause requirement is consistent with the PLRA.  Had Congress intended to require that crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so.  Pp.2629.


(d)The evidence supports the three-judge courts finding that no other relief [would] remedy the violation, 3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).  The States claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers is a population limit under the PLRA.  Even if they could be regarded as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve overcrowding.  The court also found no realistic possibility that California could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the States ongoing fiscal problems.  Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realistic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.  The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population reduction, the Receivers and Special Masters continued efforts would not achieve a remedy.  Their reports are persuasive evidence that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State.  The State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evidence of overcrowdings deleterious effects on the provision of care, compels a different conclusion here.  Pp.2933.


(e)The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation.  Pp.3341.


(1)The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required reduction.  While narrow tailoring requires a fit between the [remedys] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends, Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480, a narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not invalid simply because it will have collateral effects.  Nor does the PLRA require that result.  The order gives the State flexibility to determine who should be released, and the State could move the three-judge court to modify its terms.  The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than separately assessing each institutions need for a population limit.  The Coleman court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated to systemwide relief in Plata.  Assuming no constitutional violation results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5% limit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the order.  This will afford the State flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.  The order may shape or control the States authority in the realm of prison administration, but it leaves much to the States discretion.  The orders limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional violation.  The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order, but it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.  Pp.3336.


(2)The three-judge court gave substantial weight to any potential adverse impact on public safety from its order.  The PLRAs substantial weight requirement does not require the court to certify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public.  Here, statistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered without adversely affecting public safety in some California counties, several States, and Canada.  The court found that various available methods of reducing overcrowdinggood time credits and diverting low-risk offenders to community programswould have little or no impact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns by giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means of reducing overcrowding.  The State complains that the court approved the States population reduction plan without considering whether its specific measures would substantially threaten public safety.  But the court left state officials the choice of how best to comply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.  Developments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State has begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion that a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative effect on public safety.  Pp.3741.


2.The three-judge courts order, subject to the States right to seek its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.  Pp.4148. 


(a)To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit at the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it must order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably consistent with public safety.  Pp.4142.


(b)The three-judge courts conclusion that the prison population should be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly erroneous.  The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit between the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State Corrections Independent Review Panel.  The PLRAs narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judgments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy.  Pp.4244.


(c)The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year deadline for relief, especially in light of the States failure to contest the issue at trial.  The State has not asked this Court to extend the deadline, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility, to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.  Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes require that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public safety.  The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that the plan will be implemented without undue delay.  Such observations reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the orders basic premise.  Pp.4448.

			The State appealed a three-judge district court order directing California to remedy two ongoing violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a guarantee binding on the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by reducing the prison system population where the violations were the subject of two class actions involving a class of prisoners with serious mental disorders and a class of prisoners with serious medical conditions. At issue was whether the remedial order issued by the three-judge court was consistent with requirements and procedures set forth in a congressional statute, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (""PLRA""), 18 U.S.C. 3626. The Court held that the court-mandated population limit was necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights and was authorized by the PLRA.

09-1454|"CAMRETA v. GREENE, personally and as next friend of S. G., a minor, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 091454.Argued March 1, 2011Decided May 26, 2011*
Nearly a decade ago, petitioner Camreta, a state child protective services worker, and petitioner Alford, a county deputy sheriff, interviewed then 9-year-old S.G. at her Oregon elementary school about allegations that her father had sexually abused her.  They did not have a warrant or parental consent to conduct the interview.  S.G. eventually stated that she had been abused.  Her father stood trial for that abuse, but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.  S.G.s mother, respondent here (hereinafter S.G.), subsequently sued Camreta and Alford on SG.s behalf for damages under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the in-school interview breached the Fourth Amendments proscription on unreasonable seizures.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the officials.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals first ruled that seizing S.G. absent a warrant, court order, parental consent, or exigent circumstances violated the Constitution.  But the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct.  The court explained that it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim so that officials would be on notice that they could not dispense with traditional Fourth Amendment protections in this context.  Although the judgment entered was in their favor, Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the Ninth Circuits ruling that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.  S.G. declined to cross-petition for review of the decision that the officials have immunity.
Held:
1.This Court generally may review a lower courts constitutional ruling at the behest of government officials who have won final judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  Pp.414.


(a) The relevant statute confers unqualified power on this Court to grant certiorari upon the petition of any party.  28 U. S.C. 1254(1).  That language covers petitions brought by litigants who have prevailed, as well as those who have lost, in the courts below.  Pp.45. 


(b)An appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy Article IIIs case-or-controversy requirement.  To comply with that requirement, litigants must demonstrate a personal stake in the suit.  Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, ___.  The petitioner has such a stake when he has suffered an injury in fact that is caused by the conduct complained of and that will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561.  And the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest in the dispute, so that the case features that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 101.  The parties must have the necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation, but throughout its course.  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67.  So long as the litigants possess the requisite personal stake, an appeal presents a case or controversy, no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.  See Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 332336; Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U. S. 241.


This Article III standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a determination that their conduct violated the Constitution because that ruling may have prospective effect on the parties.  So long as it remains good law, an official who regularly engages in the challenged conduct as part of his job (as Camreta does) must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action.   The official thus can demonstrate injury, causation, and redressability.  And conversely, if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct, she has a stake in preserving the courts holding so that she will have ongoing protection from the practice.  Pp.57.


(c)This Courts prudential practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties does not bar consideration of immunized officials petitions.  The Court has recognized exceptions to this prudential rule when there has been a policy reaso[n]  of sufficient importance to allow an appeal by the winner below.  Deposit Guaranty, 445 U. S., at 336, n.7.  Just such a reason exists in qualified immunity cases.  The constitutional rulings that prevailing parties ask the Court to consider in these cases have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials and the policies of the government units to which they belong.  The rulings are self-consciously designed to produce this effect by establishing controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases.  Moreover, they are so designed with this Courts permission, to promote clarityand observanceof constitutional rules.  Taken together, these features of qualified immunity cases support bending the usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials petitions.


To begin with the nature of these suits: Under 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights.  But if those officials are entitled to qualified immunity, a court can dismiss the damages claim without ever deciding its meritsand so the qualified immunity situation threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.  To prevent that problem, this Court has permitted lower courts to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established.  See, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237.  Here, the Ninth Circuit followed exactly this two-step process so that it could settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the future conduct of officials.


Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is reviewable in this Court at an immunized officials behest.  If the Courts usual prevailing party rule applied, the official would either have to acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this Court, or defy the lower courts view, adhere to what has been declared an illegal practice, and invite further law suits and possible punitive damages.  Id., at 240241.  And applying this Courts usual bar on review would undermine the purpose of the two-step process, which is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.  Bunting v. Mellen, 541 U. S. 1019, 1024 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue, so too may it support this Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower courts decision.


This holding is limited in two respects.  First, it addresses only this Courts authority to review cases in this procedural posture.  The Court need not decide if an appellate court can also entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds.  Second, the holding concerns only what the Court may review, not what the Court actually will choose to review.  Going forward, the Court will consider prevailing parties petitions one by one in accord with its usual standards for granting certiorari.  Pp.714.


2.A separate jurisdictional problem requires the Court to dismiss this case at the threshold: The case is moot.  In a dispute of this kind, both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome.  That is true of Camreta, who remains employed as a child protective services worker, and so has an interest in challenging the Ninth Circuits ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an in-school interview.  But S.G. can no longer claim the plaintiffs usual stake in preserving the courts holding because she no longer needs protection from the challenged practice.  She has moved to Florida and is only months away from her 18th birthday and, presumably, from her high school graduation.  When subsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur, there is no live controversy to review.  United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203.


When a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, this Court has authority to direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings  as may be just under the circumstances.  28 U. S.C. 2106.  The Courts established practice is to vacate the judgment below, see, e.g., United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39, to ensure that those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled [are] not  treated as if there had been a review, ibid.  The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision from spawning any legal consequences.  Id., at 4041.  A constitutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision.  When happenstance prevents this Courts review of that ruling, the normal rule should apply: Vacatur rightly strips the decision below of its binding effect, Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 200, and clears the path for future relitigation, Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.  Because mootness has frustrated Camretas ability to challenge the Ninth Circuits ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse victim at school, that part of the Ninth Circuits decision must be vacated.  Pp.1418.

			Nearly a decade ago, petitioners, a state child protective services worker and a county deputy sheriff, interviewed then 9-year-old S.G. at her Oregon elementary school about allegations that her father had sexually abused her.

Although judgment was entered in petitioners' favor, they petitioned the Court to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. At issue was whether government officials who prevailed on grounds of qualified immunity could obtain the Court's review of a court of appeals' decision that their conduct violated the Constitution. Also at issue was, if the Court could consider cases in this procedural posture, did the Ninth Circuit correctly determine that this interview breached the Fourth Amendment. The Court held that it could generally review a lower court's constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity but could not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case had become moot because the child had grown up and moved across the country and so would never again be subject to the Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitutionality was at issue. Therefore, the Court did not reach the Fourth Amendment question in this case and vacated the part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.

10-5443|"FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 105443.Argued March 29, 2011Decided May 26, 2011
While preparing to rob a bank, petitioner Fowler and others were discovered by a local police officer, whom Fowler killed.  Fowler was convicted of violating the federal witness tampering statute, which makes it a crime to kill another person, with intent to  prevent the communication by any person to a [Federal] law enforcement officer of information relating to the  possible commission of a Federal offense, 18 U. S.C. 1512(a)(1)(C).  Rejecting Fowlers argument that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had killed the officer intending to prevent him from communicating with a federal officer, the Eleventh Circuit held that a showing of a possible or potential communication to federal authorities was sufficient.  
Held:In such circumstances, the Government must establish a 1512(a)(1)(C) violation by showing there was a reasonable likelihood that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer.  Pp. 310.
(a)In a 1512(a)(1)(C) prosecution, no state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance  that the law enforcement officer is an  employee of the Federal Government, 1512(g)(2).  Thus, the Government must prove (1) a killing, (2) committed with a particular intent, namely, an intent (a) to prevent a communication (b) about the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense (c) to a federal law enforcement officer.  P. 3. 


(b)Nothing in 1512(a)(1)(C)s language limits it to instances in which the defendant has some identifiable law enforcement officers particularly in mind.  Any such limitation would conflict with the statutes basic purpose.  Witness tampering may prove more serious (and more effective) when the crime takes place before the victim has engaged in any communication at all with officersat a time when the precise communication and nature of the officer who may receive it are not yet known.  Hence, the statute covers a defendant, like petitioner, who kills with intent to prevent communication with any and all officers.  The Court must consequently decide what, if anything, the Government must show about the likelihood of a hypothetical communication with a federal officer where the defendant did not think specifically about any particular communication or its recipient.  Pp. 47.


(c)To determine what the Government must prove in such instances, the Court looks to the dictionary definition of the statutory word prevent, which means rendering an intended, possible, or likely event impractical or impossible by anticipatory action.  No one suggests that the word intended sets forth the appropriate standard here.  The Government and the Eleventh Circuit would rest their standard on the word possible.  But that standard would eliminate the independent force of the statutory federal officer requirement, and would extend the statute beyond its intended, basically federal, scope.  Fashioning a standard based on the word likely is consistent with the statutes language and objectives.  Thus, where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent includes an intent to prevent communications with federal officers only if there is a reasonable likelihood under the circumstances that, in the absence of the killing, at least one of the relevant communications would have been made to a federal officer.  The Government need not show that such a communication, had it occurred, would have been federal beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even that it is more likely than not.  But it must show that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or hypothetical.  Pp. 710.


(d)Because Fowlers argument that the evidence is insufficient to satisfy a reasonable likelihood standard was not raised at trial, the lower courts must determine whether, and how, the standard applies in this case.  P. 10.

While preparing to rob a bank, petitioner Fowler and others were discovered by a local police officer, whom Fowler killed.  Fowler was convicted of violating the federal witness tampering statute, which makes it a crime to kill another person, with intent to  prevent the communication by any person to a [Federal] law enforcement officer of information relating to the  possible commission of a Federal offense, 18 U.

			While preparing to rob a bank, petitioner and others were discovered by a local police officer, whom petitioner killed. Petitioner was convicted of violating the federal witness tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. 1512(a)(1)(C). At issue was how the language of the statute applied when a defendant killed a victim, with an intent to prevent a communication about the commission or possible commission of a federal offense, but to law enforcement officers in general rather than to some specific law enforcement officer or set of officers which defendant had in mind. The Court held that in such circumstances, the Government must establish a section 1512(a)(1)(C) violation by showing there was a reasonable likelihood that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer.

09-1298|"GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 091298.Argued January 18, 2011Decided May 23, 2011
After petitioners fell behind schedule in developing a stealth aircraft (A12) for the Navy, the contracting officer terminated their $4.8 billion fixed-price contract for default and ordered petitioners to repay approximately $1.35 billion in progress payments for work the Government never accepted.  Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), challenging the termination decision under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.  They argued that Federal Circuit precedent permitted their default to be excused because the Government had failed to share its superior knowledge about how to design and manufacture stealth aircraft.  Uncovering the extent of such knowledge proved difficult because the design, materials, and manufacturing process for prior stealth aircraft, operated by the Air Force, are closely guarded military secrets.  After military secrets were disclosed during discovery, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force warned the CFC that further discovery into the extent of the Governments superior knowledge would risk disclosing classified information.  The CFC terminated such discovery and found the superior-knowledge question nonjusticiable.  The CFC subsequently converted the termination into a less-Government-friendly termination for convenience and awarded petitioners $1.2 billion.  The Federal Circuit reversed.  On remand, the CFC sustained the default termination and reaffirmed that petitioners superior-knowledge affirmative defense could not be litigated.  The Federal Circuit again reversed, but it found that the state-secrets privilege prevented adjudicating petitioners superior-knowledge defense.  On remand, the CFC again found petitioners had defaulted, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.  
Held:When, to protect state secrets, a court dismisses a Government contractors prima facie valid affirmative defense to the Governments allegations of contractual breach, the proper remedy is to leave the parties where they were on the day they filed suit.  Pp.514.
(a) The CFC held that, since invocation of the state-secrets privilege obscured too many of the facts relevant to the superior-knowledge defense, the issue of that defense was nonjusticiable, even though petitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged evidence for a prima facie showing.  In this situation, the Court must exercise its common-law authority to fashion contractual remedies in Government-contracting disputes.  The relevant state-secrets jurisprudence comes not from United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, which deals with the Governments evidentiary privilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets, but from Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105, and Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, two cases dealing with alleged contracts to spy.


Where liability depends on the validity of a plausible superior-knowledge defense, and when full litigation of that defense would inevitably lead to the disclosure of state secrets, Totten, supra, at 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief.  It seems unrealistic to separate the claim from the defense, allowing the former to proceed while barring the latter.  Claims and defenses together establish the justification, or lack of justification, for judicial relief; and when public policy precludes judicial intervention for the one it should also preclude judicial intervention for the other.  Suit on the contract, or for performance rendered or funds paid under the contract, will not lie, and courts should leave the parties to the agreement where they stood on the day they filed suit.  The Government suggests that at the time of suit, petitioners had been held in default by the contracting officer and were liable for the ensuing consequences.  But that was merely one step in the parties contractual regime.  The position of the parties at the time of suit is not their position with regard to legal burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related determinations, but their position with regard to possession of funds and property.  Pp.510.


(b)Neither side will be entirely happy with this resolution.  General Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants to turn the termination into one for convenience and reinstate the CFCs $1.2 billion award, but that is not an option under the A12 agreement.  Moreover, state secrets would make it impossible to calculate petitioners damages.  The Government wants a return of the $1.35 billion it paid petitioners for work never accepted, but the validity of that claim depends on the nonjusticiable issue whether petitioners are in default.  As in Totten, see 92 U. S., at 106, the Courts refusal to enforce this contract captures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or reasonably ought to have been.  They must have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of inadequate performance claims.  Moreover, this rulings impact here is likely much more significant than its impact in future cases, except to the extent that it renders the law more predictable and hence more subject to accommodation by contracting parties.  Whether the Government had an obligation to share its superior knowledge about stealth technology is left for the Federal Circuit to address on remand.  Pp.1013.

09-804|"CIGNA CORP. et al. v. AMARA etal., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 09804.Argued November 30, 2010Decided May 16, 2011
Until 1998, petitioner CIGNA Corporations pension plan provided a retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and length of service.  Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, increased by compound interest.  The new plan translated already-earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the cash balance account.  Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plans adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNAs notice of the changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits.  The District Court found that CIGNAs disclosures violated its obligations under 102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  In determining relief, it found that CIGNAs notice defects had caused the employees likely harm.  It then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits accordingly, finding its authority in ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), which authorizes a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due  under the terms of his plan.  The Second Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1.Although 502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority to reform CIGNAs plan, relief is authorized by 502(a)(3), which allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of ERISA or the [plans] terms.  Pp.1220.


(a)The court ordered relief in two steps.  Step 1: It ordered the terms of the plan reformed.  Step 2: It ordered CIGNA to enforce the plan as reformed.  Step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the terms of [the reformed] plan and is thus consistent with 502(a)(1)(B).  However, that provisionwhich speaks of enforc[ing] the plans terms, not changing themdoes not suggest that it authorizes a court to alter those terms here, where the change, akin to reforming a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.  Nor can the Court accept the Solicitor Generals alternative rationale: that the District Court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they are plan terms.  That reading cannot be squared with ERISA 102(a), which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions, but does not suggest that information about the plan provided by those disclosures is itself part of the plan.  Nothing in 502(a)(1)(B) suggests the contrary.  The Solicitor Generals reading also cannot be squared with the statutes division of authority between a plans sponsorwho, like a trusts settlor, creates the plans basic terms and conditions, executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument a procedure for making amendmentsand the plans administratora trustee-like fiduciary who manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions.  ERISA carefully distinguishes these roles, and there is no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summaries, even when, as here, the administrator is also the plan sponsor.  Finally, it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a summarys language legally binding with the basic summary plan description objective of clear, simple communication.  Pp.1215.


(b)This Court has interpreted 502(a)(3)s phrase appropriate equitable relief as referring to those categories of relief that, before the merger of law and equity,were typically available in equity.  Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356, 361.  This caseconcerning a beneficiarys suit against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust)is the kind of lawsuit that, before the merger, could have been brought only in an equity court, where the remedies available were traditionally considered equitable remedies.  The District Courts injunctions obviously fall within this category.  The other relief it ordered closely resembles three forms of traditional equitable relief.  First, what the court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the plans terms, in order to remedy false or misleading information CIGNA provided.  The power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court and is used to prevent fraud.  Second, the part of the remedy holding CIGNA to its promise that the new plan would not take from its employees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel, also a traditional equitable remedy.  Third, the injunctions require the plan administrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed.  Equity courts possessed the power to provide monetary compensation for a loss resulting from a trustees breach of duty, or to prevent the trustees unjust enrichment.  That surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.  Pp.1620.


2.Because 502(a)(3) authorizes appropriate equitable relief for violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm will depend on the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief.  That court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance, but there are several equitable principles that it might apply on remand.  Neither ERISAs relevant substantive provisions nor 502(a)(3) sets a particular standard for determining harm.  And equity law provides no general principle that detrimental reliance must be proved before a remedy is decreed.  To the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that requirement.  Thus, when a court exercises authority under 502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.  However, equity courts did not insist on a detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected the substance of a contract.  Nor did they require a detrimental reliance showing when they ordered surcharge.  They simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustees breach of trust.  This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance requirement.  To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under 502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of detrimental reliance.  But it might also come from the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents.  It is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here, in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on the summaries.  Thus, to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of 102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.  Pp.2022.

And equity law provides no general principle that detrimental reliance must be proved before a remedy is decreed.  To the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that requirement.  Thus, when a court exercises authority under 502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.  However, equity courts did not insist on a detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected the substance of a contract.  Nor did they require a detrimental reliance showing when they ordered surcharge.  They simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustees breach of trust.  This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance requirement.  To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under 502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of detrimental reliance.  But it might also come from the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents.  It is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here, in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on the summaries.  Thus, to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of 102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.

			Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the CIGNA Corporation's (""CIGNA"") Pension Plan, challenged the new plan's adoption, claiming that CIGNA's notice of the changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits. At issue was whether the district court applied the correct legal standard, namely, a ""likely harm"" standard, in determining that CIGNA's notice violations caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal relief. The Court held that although section 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA""), 29 U.S.C. 1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h), did not give the district court authority to reform CIGNA's plan, relief was authorized by section 502(a)(3), which allowed a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary ""to obtain other appropriate relief"" to redress violations of ERISA ""or the [plan's] terms."" The Court also held that, because section 502(a)(3) authorized ""appropriate equitable relief"" for violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm would depend on the equitable theory by which the district court provided relief.

10-1000|"DAVID BOBBY, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.
HARRY MITTS
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 101000.Decided May 2, 2011
Per Curiam.

An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted murder.  He was sentenced to death.  At issue here is part of the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of Mittss trial.  The instructions, in pertinent part, were as follows:
[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing in the separate counts, are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you find are present in this case.


When all 12 members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, if any, then you must return such finding to the Court.


I instruct you as a matter of law that if you make such a finding, then you must recommend to the Court that the sentence of death be imposed on [Mitts].
.....


On the other hand, [if] after considering all the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances with which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a353a.

We considered virtually the same Ohio jury instructions last Term in Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7).  See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F.3d 650, 652 (CA6 2010) (noting that the instructions in this case are the same Ohio instructions that were given in Spisak).  That case, like this one, involved review of a federal habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  AEDPA provides, as relevant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).


In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that had found these instructions invalid under our decision in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).  See 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 89).  Up until our decision in Spisak, Mitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions were invalid under Mills.  After Spisak rejected that claim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that the instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated Mittss death sentence.  See 620 F.3d, at 658.


In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be imposed when the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.  447 U. S., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We explained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction because it interjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding process, diverting the jurys attention from the central issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime.  Id., at 638, 642.  [F]orcing the jury to choose between conviction on the capital offense and acquittal, we observed, may encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reasonits belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished, even when there is some doubt with respect to an element of the capital offense.  Id., at 632, 642, 637.  Because the scheme in Beck created a danger that the jury would resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we concluded that it violated due process.  See id., at 638, 643.


According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty phase instructions given at Mittss trialand the Supreme Court of Ohio decision upholding their usewere contrary to Beck, because they interposed before the jury the same false choice that our holding in Beck prohibits.  620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Referring to the instructions as acquittal-first, the Court of Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the jury to first decide whether to acquit Mitts of the death penalty before considering mercy and some form of life imprisonment.  Id., at 656657.  Interpreting Beck to stand for the proposition that a jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment, the Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions given during the penalty phase of Mittss trial unconstitutionally deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider a life sentence.  620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).


The instructions here are surely not invalid under our decision in Beck.  The concern addressed in Beck was the risk of an unwarranted conviction created when the jury is forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of a capital offense and declaring him innocent of any wrongdoing.  447 U. S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at 638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984) (explaining that the goal of the Beck rule is to eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and innocence); Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (Our fundamental concern in Beck was that a jury convinced that the defendant had committed some violent crime but not convinced that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all).


The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase, not the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that the logic of Beck is not directly applicable to penalty phase proceedings.  In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983), we rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruction to a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governors power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole.  463 U. S., at 994, 10061009.  In so doing, we noted the fundamental difference between the nature of the guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the nature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.  Id., at 1007.  In light of that critical distinction, we observed that the concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwarranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the deliberative process in which the capital jury engages in determining the appropriate penalty.  Id., at 1009; see also Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the central concern of Beck simply is not implicated when the jury was not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense of conviction (capital murder) and innocence).


The jurors in Mittss case could not have plausibly thought that if they declined to recommend the death penalty Mitts would escape all penalties for his alleged participation in the crime.  Beck, supra, at 629.  They had just convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted murder.  They were specifically instructed that if they did not find that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factorsand therefore did not recommend the death penaltythey would choose from two life sentence options.  There is accordingly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case, unlike the jurors in Beck, could have been improperly influenced by a fear that a decision short of death would have resulted in Mitts walking free.


We all but decided the question presented here in Spisak itself.  After rejecting the contention that the Ohio instructions were contrary to Mills, we noted that the Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that the instructions require[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives.  558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F.3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)).  That is essentially the Beck claim presented here.  See 620 F.3d, at 658 (holding that a jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment).  We rejected that claim in Spisak under AEDPA, noting that [w]e have not . . . previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason.  558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Although neither the parties nor the courts below in Spisak had cited Beck, a separate concurrence in Spisak would have struck down the instructions in reliance on that decision.  See 558 U. S., at ___ (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 36).  The Court nonetheless concluded that whatever the merits of that argument on direct review, the jury instructions at Spisaks trial were not contrary to clearly established Federal law under AEDPA.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The same conclusion applies here.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is
Reversed.

09-1272|"KENTUCKY v. KING
certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky
No. 091272.Argued January 12, 2011Decided May 16, 2011
Police officers in Lexington, Kentucky, followed a suspected drug dealer to an apartment complex.  They smelled marijuana outside an apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence.  As soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises coming from the apartment; the officers believed that these noises were consistent with the destruction of evidence.  The officers announced their intent to enter the apartment, kicked in the door, and found respondent and others.  They saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent search.  The Circuit Court denied respondents motion to suppress the evidence, holding that exigent circumstancesthe need to prevent destruction of evidencejustified the warrantless entry.  Respondent entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed.  The court assumed that exigent circumstances existed, but it nonetheless invalidated the search.  The exigent circumstances rule did not apply, the court held, because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. 
Held: 
1.The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.516.


(a)The Fourth Amendment expressly imposes two requirements: All searches and seizures must be reasonable; and a warrant may not be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope of the authorized search is set out with particularity.  Although searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable, Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403, this presumption may be overcome when the exigencies of the situationmake the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394.  One such exigency is the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.  Brigham City, supra, at 403.  Pp.56.


(b)Under the police-created exigency doctrine, which lower courts have developed as an exception to the exigent circumstances rule, exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when the exigency was created or manufactured by the conduct of the police.  The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for determining when police impermissibly create an exigency.  Pp.78.


(c)The proper test follows from the principle that permits warrantless searches: warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.  Thus, a warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct violating the Fourth Amendment.  A similar approach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.  For example, officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made, see Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128, 136140; and they may seek consent-based encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs, see INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 217, n.5.  Pp.810.


(d)Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have imposed additional requirementsasking whether officers deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement, 302 S.W.3d 649, 656 (case below); reasoning that police may not rely on an exigency if it was reasonably foreseeable that [their] investigative tactics  would create the exigent circumstances,ibid.; faulting officers for knocking on a door when they had sufficient evidence to seek a warrant but did not do so; and finding that officers created or manufactured an exigency when their investigation was contrary to standard or good law enforcement practices.  Such requirements are unsound and are thus rejected.  Pp.1014.


(e)Respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly created when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable, but that approach is also flawed.  The ability of officers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such subtleties as the officers tone of voice in announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks.  A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.  Respondents test would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock without running afoul of the police-created exigency rule.  And in most cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed.  Pp. 1415.


2.Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment.  Pp.1619.


(a)Any question about whether an exigency existed here is better addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand.  P.17.


(b)Assuming an exigency did exist, the officers conductbanging on the door and announcing their presencewas entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.  Respondent has pointed to no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort of demand to enter the apartment, much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment.  If there is contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Courts attention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.  Finally, the record makes clear that the officers announcement that they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency arose.  Pp.1719.
302 S.W. 3d 649, reversed and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

10-188|"SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. KIRK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 10188.Argued March 1, 2011Decided May 16, 2011
The public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally forecloses private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media.  31 U. S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).  Respondent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, petitioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its federal contracts.  To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S.C. 552.  Granting Schindlers motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded, inter alia, that the FCAs public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdiction over Kirks allegations that were based on information disclosed in a Government report or investigation.  The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agencys response to a FOIA request is neither a report nor an investigation.
Held:A federal agencys written response to a FOIA request for records constitutes a report within the meaning of the FCAs public disclosure bar.  Pp. 414.
(a)[R]eport in this context carries its ordinary meaning.  Pp. 48.


(1)Because the FCA does not define report, the Court looks first to the words ordinary meaning.  See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___.  Dictionaries define report as, for example, something that gives information.  This ordinary meaning is consistent with the public disclosure bars generally broad scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the other sources of public disclosure in 3730(e)(4)(A), especially news media.  Pp. 46.


(2)Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of report.  The Second Circuit committed the very error this Court reversed in Graham County.  In applying the noscitur a sociis canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for report was mandated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclosure listed in the statutein particular, the reference to news media.  See 559 U. S., at ___.  Applying the ordinary meaning of report also does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in 3730(e)(4)(A).  Pp. 68.


(b)The DOLs three written FOIA responses in this case, along with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are reports within the public disclosure bars ordinary meaning.  FOIA requires each agency receiving a request to notify the person making such request of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.  5 U. S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted FOIA regulations mandating a written response.  Such agency responses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of report as, e.g., something that gives information.  Moreover, any records produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report.  Pp. 89. 


(c)This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.  Pp. 914.


(1)The Courts holding is not inconsistent with the public disclosure bars drafting history.  If anything, the drafting history supports this Courts holding.  Kirks case seems a classic example of the opportunistic litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.  Id., at ___.  Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA.  Pp. 911.


(2)Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.  Kirk argues that the Courts ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator possessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents by way of a FOIA request.  Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unrequested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the Court is not troubled by the different treatment.  By its plain terms, the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others.  See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bars scope and some did not.  Moreover, Kirks assertion that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA request for incriminating documents is pure speculation.  Cf. id., at ___.  There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA responses are reports within the public disclosure bars meaning.  Pp. 1113.


(3)Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted, Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define report to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documentse.g., the Justice Departments annual report of FOIA statisticsthat are indisputably reports.  Pp. 1314.


(d)Whether Kirks suit is based upon  allegations or transactions disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on remand.  P. 14.  
601 F.3d 94, reversed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

The public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally forecloses private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media.  31 U. S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).  Respondent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, petitioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its federal contracts.  To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S.C. 552.  Granting Schindlers motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded, inter alia, that the FCAs public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdiction over Kirks allegations that were based on information disclosed in a Government report or investigation.  The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agencys response to a FOIA request is neither a report nor an investigation.
Held:A federal agencys written response to a FOIA request for records constitutes a report within the meaning of the FCAs public disclosure bar.  Pp. 414.
(a)[R]eport in this context carries its ordinary meaning.  Pp. 48.


(1)Because the FCA does not define report, the Court looks first to the words ordinary meaning.  See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___.  Dictionaries define report as, for example, something that gives information.  This ordinary meaning is consistent with the public disclosure bars generally broad scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the other sources of public disclosure in 3730(e)(4)(A), especially news media.  Pp. 46.


(2)Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of report.  The Second Circuit committed the very error this Court reversed in Graham County.  In applying the noscitur a sociis canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for report was mandated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclosure listed in the statutein particular, the reference to news media.  See 559 U. S., at ___.  Applying the ordinary meaning of report also does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in 3730(e)(4)(A).  Pp. 68.


(b)The DOLs three written FOIA responses in this case, along with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are reports within the public disclosure bars ordinary meaning.  FOIA requires each agency receiving a request to notify the person making such request of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.  5 U. S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted FOIA regulations mandating a written response.  Such agency responses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of report as, e.g., something that gives information.  Moreover, any records produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report.  Pp. 89. 


(c)This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.  Pp. 914.


(1)The Courts holding is not inconsistent with the public disclosure bars drafting history.  If anything, the drafting history supports this Courts holding.  Kirks case seems a classic example of the opportunistic litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.  Id., at ___.  Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA.  Pp. 911.


(2)Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.  Kirk argues that the Courts ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator possessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents by way of a FOIA request.  Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unrequested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the Court is not troubled by the different treatment.  By its plain terms, the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others.  See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bars scope and some did not.  Moreover, Kirks assertion that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA request for incriminating documents is pure speculation.  Cf. id., at ___.  There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA responses are reports within the public disclosure bars meaning.  Pp. 1113.


(3)Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted, Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define report to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documentse.g., the Justice Departments annual report of FOIA statisticsthat are indisputably reports.  Pp. 1314.


(d)Whether Kirks suit is based upon  allegations or transactions disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on remand.  P. 14.  
601 F.3d 94, reversed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case."|"
			Respondent filed an action under the False Claims Act (""FCA""), 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A), alleging that his former employer had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its federal contracts. At issue was whether a federal agency's written response to a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA""), 5 U.S.C. 552, constituted a ""report"" within the meaning of the public disclosure bar. The Court held that a federal agency's written response to a FOIA request for records constituted a ""report"" within the meaning of the FCA's public disclosure bar where a ""report,"" in this context, carried its ordinary meaning; where the Labor Department's three written responses in this case, along with the accompanying records produced to respondent's wife, were ""reports"" within the public disclosure bar's ordinary meaning; where the Court was not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses; and whether respondent's suit was ""based upon... allegations or transactions"" disclosed in the reports at issue was a question to be resolved on remand.

09-1088|"CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN v. PINHOLSTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 091088.Argued November 9, 2010Decided April 4, 2011
A California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first-degree murder.  At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prosecution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholsters history of threatening and violent behavior.  Pinholsters trial counsel, who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice under California law, called only Pinholsters mother.  Counsel did not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg, who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sentenced to death.  Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the California Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase.  He introduced additional evidence to support his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure disorders, and who criticized Dr. Stalbergs report.  Each time, the State Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the merits.  Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28 U. S.C. 2254.  Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the State Supreme Courts decision involved an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, 2254(d)(1).
Held:
1.Review under 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.  Pp.814.


(a)As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 2254 sets several limits on a federal courts power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner.  As relevant here, a claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings, shall not be granted  unless the adjudication (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  2254(d).  This difficult to meet, Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___, and highly deferential standard  demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt, Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24.  Section 2254(d)(1)s backward-looking languageresulted in and involvedrequires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.  It follows that the record under review is also limited to the record in existence at that same timei.e., the state-court record.  This understanding is compelled by the broader context of the statute as a whole, which demonstrates Congress intent to channel prisoners claims first to state courts.  Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341.  It is also consistent with this Courts precedents, which emphasize that 2254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did.  See, e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 7172.  Moreover, it is consistent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained that a federal habeas court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing when the state-court record precludes habeas relief under 2254(d)s limitations.  The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649, as supporting the contrary view.  Pp.812.


(b)This holding does not render superfluous 2254(e)(2)which limits the federal habeas courts discretion to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.  At a minimum, 2254(e)(2) still restricts their discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court.  Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPAs statutory scheme is designed to strongly discourage them from doing so.  Pp.1314.


(c)Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here, because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone.  P.14.


2.On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled to federal habeas relief.  Pp.1431.


(a)To satisfy 2254(d)(1)s unreasonable application prong, he must show that there was no reasonable basis for the State Supreme Courts summary decision.  Richter, supra, at ___.  Pp.1516.


(b)Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, provides the clearly established federal law here.  To overcome the strong presumption that counsel has acted competently, id., at 690, a defendant must show that counsel failed to act reasonabl[y] considering all the circumstances, id., at 688, and must prove the reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different, id., at 694.  Review here is thus doubly deferential, Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___, requiring a highly deferential look at counsels performance, Strickland, supra, at 689, through 2254(d)s deferential lens, Mirzayance, supra, at ___, n.2.  Pp.1618. 


(c)Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Courts decision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of federal law.  Pp.1826.


(1)The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel acted strategically to get the prosecutions aggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a mitigation witness.  Billing records show that they spent time investigating mitigating evidence.  The record also shows that they had an unsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history during the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.  In addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no significant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholsters medical and social history.  Given these impediments, it would have been a reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for Pinholsters mother.  Pinholster has responded with only a handful of post-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers.  Pp.1823.


(2)The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from this Courts recent cases a constitutional duty to investigate and a principle that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an investigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholsters background.  Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, specific guidelines are not appropriate under Strickland.  466 U. S., at 688.  Nor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of competence mandated by Strickland.  Pp.2326.


(d)Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster also has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have unreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced.  Pp. 2631.


(1)To determine whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer  would have concluded that death was not warranted, Strickland, supra, at 695, the aggravating evidence is reweighed against the totality of available mitigating evidence, Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534.  Here, the State presented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty phases.  The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty-phase testimony of Pinholsters mother and guilt-phase testimony given by his brother.  After considering the evidence, the jury returned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found supported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence.  Pp.2629.


(2)There is no reasonable probability that the additional evidence presented at Pinholsters state proceedings would have changed the verdict.  The new evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence of his mother and brother at trial.  To the extent that there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of questionable mitigating value.  Dr. Woods testimony would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to Pinholsters substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation.  The remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse.  Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Courts determination was unreasonable.  Pp.2930.


(3)Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, those cases lack the important doubly deferential standard of Strickland and AEDPA, and thus offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking.  Pp.3031.

09-846|"UNITED STATES v. TOHONO OODHAM NATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 09846.Argued November 1, 2010Decided April 26, 2011
Respondent Tohono Oodham Nation (Nation) filed suit in Federal District Court against federal officials who managed tribal assets held in trust by the Federal Government, alleging violations of fiduciary duty and requesting equitable relief.  The next day, the Nation filed this action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), alleging almost identical violations and requesting money damages.  The CFC case was dismissed under 28 U. S.C. 1500, which bars CFC jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim pending against the United States or its agents in another court.  The Federal Circuit reversed, finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim because, although they shared operative facts, they did not seek overlapping relief.
Held: 
1.Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim, precluding CFC jurisdiction, if they are based on substantially the same operative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.  Pp.29.


(a)Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the CFC and its predecessors when related actions are pending elsewhere.  Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212, held that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts , at least if there [is] some overlap in the relief requested, but it reserved the question whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same operative facts do not seek overlapping relief.  The rule now codified in 1500 was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the Confederacy who, in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the Federal Government, sued the Government in the Court of Claims and, at the same time, sued federal officials in other courts, seeking tort relief for the same actions.  Section 1500s robust response to this problem bars CFC jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an identical claim elsewhere, but also if the other action is related but not identical.  The phrase in respect to does not resolve all doubt as to the bars scope, but it suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of whether claim carries a special or limited meaning.  Pp.24.


(b)Keene permits two constructions of for or in respect to the same claim, one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus remedial overlap.  The former is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the statutes use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only with factual overlap.  The CFC bar applies where the other action is against a person who,  when the cause of action  arose, was, in respect thereto, acting under color of federal law.  But at the time that a cause of action arose, the person could not act in respect to the relief requested, for no complaint was yet filed.  Although the phrase at issue involves a claim rather than a cause of action, there is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to relief.  As Keene explained, claim is used here synonymously with cause of action, 508 U. S., at 210.  And if the phrase that uses cause of action, the more technical term, does not embrace the concept of remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.  Pp.45.


(c)This reading also makes sense in light of the CFCs unique remedial powers.  Because the CFC is the only judicial forum for most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the United States and because it has no general power to provide equitable relief against the Government or its officers, a statute aimed at precluding duplicate CFC suits would be unlikely to require remedial overlap.  Remedial overlap was even more unusual when 1500s rule was first enacted in 1868.  The Federal Circuit could identify no purpose the statute served in light of that courts precedent.  But courts should not render statutes nugatory through construction.  The statutes purpose is clear from its originsthe need to save the Government from redundant litigationand the conclusion that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim.  Concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of claim preclusion, or res judicata.  The Nation errs in arguing that this Courts interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose between partial remedies available in different courts.  The Nation could have recovered any losses in the CFC alone.  Even if some hardship were shown, this Court enjoy[s] no liberty to add an exception  to remove apparent hardship.  Keene, supra, at 217218.  Pp.59.


2.The substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nations District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC.  Both actions allege that the United States holds the same assets in trust for the Nations benefit, and they describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty.  Pp.910.

Respondent Tohono Oodham Nation (Nation) filed suit in Federal District Court against federal officials who managed tribal assets held in trust by the Federal Government, alleging violations of fiduciary duty and requesting equitable relief.  The next day, the Nation filed this action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), alleging almost identical violations and requesting money damages.  The CFC case was dismissed under 28 U. S.C. 1500, which bars CFC jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim pending against the United States or its agents in another court.  The Federal Circuit reversed, finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim because, although they shared operative facts, they did not seek overlapping relief.
Held: 
1.Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim, precluding CFC jurisdiction, if they are based on substantially the same operative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.  Pp.29.


(a)Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the CFC and its predecessors when related actions are pending elsewhere.  Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212, held that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts , at least if there [is] some overlap in the relief requested, but it reserved the question whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same operative facts do not seek overlapping relief.  The rule now codified in 1500 was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the Confederacy who, in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the Federal Government, sued the Government in the Court of Claims and, at the same time, sued federal officials in other courts, seeking tort relief for the same actions.  Section 1500s robust response to this problem bars CFC jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an identical claim elsewhere, but also if the other action is related but not identical.  The phrase in respect to does not resolve all doubt as to the bars scope, but it suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of whether claim carries a special or limited meaning.  Pp.24.


(b)Keene permits two constructions of for or in respect to the same claim, one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus remedial overlap.  The former is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the statutes use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only with factual overlap.  The CFC bar applies where the other action is against a person who,  when the cause of action  arose, was, in respect thereto, acting under color of federal law.  But at the time that a cause of action arose, the person could not act in respect to the relief requested, for no complaint was yet filed.  Although the phrase at issue involves a claim rather than a cause of action, there is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to relief.  As Keene explained, claim is used here synonymously with cause of action, 508 U. S., at 210.  And if the phrase that uses cause of action, the more technical term, does not embrace the concept of remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.  Pp.45.


(c)This reading also makes sense in light of the CFCs unique remedial powers.  Because the CFC is the only judicial forum for most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the United States and because it has no general power to provide equitable relief against the Government or its officers, a statute aimed at precluding duplicate CFC suits would be unlikely to require remedial overlap.  Remedial overlap was even more unusual when 1500s rule was first enacted in 1868.  The Federal Circuit could identify no purpose the statute served in light of that courts precedent.  But courts should not render statutes nugatory through construction.  The statutes purpose is clear from its originsthe need to save the Government from redundant litigationand the conclusion that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim.  Concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of claim preclusion, or res judicata.  The Nation errs in arguing that this Courts interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose between partial remedies available in different courts.  The Nation could have recovered any losses in the CFC alone.  Even if some hardship were shown, this Court enjoy[s] no liberty to add an exception  to remove apparent hardship.  Keene, supra, at 217218.  Pp.59.


2.The substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nations District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC.  Both actions allege that the United States holds the same assets in trust for the Nations benefit, and they describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty.  Pp.910.
559 F.3d 1284, reversed and remanded.

09-893|"AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09893.Argued November 9, 2010Decided April 27, 2011
The cellular telephone contract between respondents (Concepcions) and petitioner (AT&T) provided for arbitration of all disputes, but did not permit classwide arbitration.  After the Concepcions were charged sales tax on the retail value of phones provided free under their service contract, they sued AT&T in a California Federal District Court.  Their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging, inter alia, that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on free phones.  The District Court denied AT&Ts motion to compel arbitration under the Concepcions contract.  Relying on the California Supreme Courts Discover Bank decision, it found the arbitration provision unconscionable because it disallowed classwide proceedings.  The Ninth Circuit agreed that the provision was unconscionable under California law and held that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which makes arbitration agreements valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract, 9 U. S.C. 2, did not preempt its ruling.  
Held:Because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67, Californias Discover Bank rule is pre-empted by the FAA.  Pp.418.
(a)Section 2 reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24, and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract, Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____, ____.  Thus, courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and enforce them according to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478.  Section 2s saving clause permits agreements to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses, but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.  Doctors Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687.  Pp.45.


(b)In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court held that class waivers in consumer arbitration agreements are unconscionable if the agreement is in an adhesion contract, disputes between the parties are likely to involve small amounts of damages, and the party with inferior bargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to defraud.  Pp.56.


(c)The Concepcions claim that the Discover Bank rule is a ground that exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract under FAA 2.  When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule.  But the inquiry is more complex when a generally applicable doctrine is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes with arbitration.  Although 2s saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAAs objectives.  Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 872.  The FAAs overarching purpose is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate informal, streamlined proceedings.  Parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628, to arbitrate according to specific rules, Volt, supra, at 479, and to limit with whom they will arbitrate, Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at ___.  Pp.612.


(d)Class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by Discover Bank rather than consensual, interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration.  The switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices arbitrations informality and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.  And class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.  The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected.  That risk of error may become unacceptable when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are aggregated and decided at once.  Arbitration is poorly suited to these higher stakes.  In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification decision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S.C. 10 limits the grounds on which courts can vacate arbitral awards.  Pp.1218.
584 F.3d 849, reversed and remanded.

09-529|"VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY v. STEWART, COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA
DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 09529.Argued December 1, 2010Decided April 19, 2011
Together, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness.  As a condition of funding, a State must establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system to protect and advocate [those individuals] rights.  42 U. S.C. 15043(a)(1).  A participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system, but if a state agency it must have authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agencies or officers.  Virginia has appointed an independent state agency, petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), authorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals rights, free of executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginias attorney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.


While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental hospitals, VOPA asked respondentsstate officials in charge of those hospitalsto produce relevant patient records.  Respondents refused, asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclosure.  VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that respondents refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to produce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with VOPAs right of access.  Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not apply because the suit was brought by a state agency.
Held:Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same State.  Pp.413.
(a)Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a private persons suit against a State.  Pp.45. 


(b)The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89.  It rests on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes.  It does not apply when the state is the  party in interest. Id., at 101.  Pp.56.


(c)Entertaining VOPAs action is consistent with precedent and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity.  Pp.613.


(1)Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 535 U. S. 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrines applicability, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.   Id., at 645.  VOPAs suit satisfies that inquiry.  Respondents concede that the action would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a state agency.  The general criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought, Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit.  This Court applied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur dAlene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would extinguish [Idahos] control over  lands and waters long deemed  an integral part of its territory.  Id., at 282.  Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of Virginias sovereignty.  Pp.79.


(2)Respondents claim that a States dignity is diminished when a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components.  But a States stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own agency sues to enforce its officers compliance with federal law than when a private person does so.  Moreover, VOPAs power to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginias own decision to establish a public P&A system.  Not every offense to a States dignity constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity.  The specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit happens to be brought by another state agency.  Pp.911.


(3)The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence of past constitutional doubts.  In order to invoke the Ex parte Young exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such conditions rarely coincide.  In any event, the principles undergirding the Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.  Pp.1213.
568 F.3d 110, reversed and remanded.

08-1438|"SOSSAMON v. TEXAS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 081438.Argued November 2, 2010Decided April 20, 2011
After this Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments because it exceeded Congress power under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.  RLUIPA targets two areas of state and local action: landuse regulation, RLUIPA 2, 42 U. S.C. 2000cc, and restrictions on the religious exercise of institutionalized persons, RLUIPA 3, 2000cc1.  It also provides an express private cause of action for appropriate relief against a government, 2000cc2(a), including, inter alia, States, their instrumentalities and officers, and persons acting under color of state law, 2000cc5(4)(A).


Petitioner Sossamon, a Texas prison inmate, sued respondents, the State and prison officials, seeking injunctive and monetary relief under RLUIPA for prison policies that prevented inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions and that barred use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  Granting respondents summary judgment, the District Court held that sovereign immunity barred Sossamons claims for monetary relief.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the statutory phrase appropriate relief against a government did not unambiguously notify Texas that its acceptance of federal funds was conditioned on a waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for monetary relief.
Held:States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA.  Pp.414.
(a)Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important constitutional limitation on the power of the federal courts.  See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98.  This Court has consistently made clear that federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.  Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54.  A State, however, may choose to waive its immunity.  Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447448.  The test for determining whether [it has done so] is a stringent one.  College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675.  The States consent to suit must be unequivocally expressed in the relevant statutes text.  Pennhurst, supra, at 99.  A waiver will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.  Lane v. Pe&nacute;a, 518 U. S. 187, 192.  Pp.46.


(b)RLUIPAs authorization of appropriate relief against a government, is not an unequivocal expression of state consent.  Pp.610.


(1)Appropriate relief is open-ended and ambiguous about the relief it includes.  Appropriate is inherently context-dependent.  And the context herewhere the defendant is a sovereignsuggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not suitable or proper.  See Federal Maritime Commn v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 765.  Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity.  Sossamons and Texas conflicting plausible arguments about whether immunity is preserved here demonstrate that appropriate relief in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that the Court may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their immunity.  Pp.69.


(2)The Courts use of the phrase appropriate relief in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, does not compel a contrary conclusion.  In those cases, where there was no express congressional intent to limit remedies available against municipal entities under an implied right of action, the Court presumed that compensatory damages were available.  Franklin, supra, at 73.  But that presumption is irrelevant to construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity, where the question is not whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has given clear direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.  Pp.910.


(c)Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress enactment of RLUIPA 3 pursuant to the Spending Clause put the States on notice that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available for a breach of contract.  While acknowledging the contract-law analogy, this Court has been clear not [to] imply  that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise, Barnes, supra, at 188, n.2, or to rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against the States.  Applying ordinary contract principles here would also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique: They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance.  More fundamentally, Sossamons implied-contract remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant statutes text.  Pp.1012.


(d)Sossamon also errs in arguing that Texas was put on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, which expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance, 42 U. S.C. 2000d7.  Even if such a residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, RLUIPA 3which prohibits substantial burden[s] on religious exerciseis not unequivocally a statute prohibiting discrimination within 1003s meaning.  All the statutory provisions enumerated in 1003 explicitly prohibit discrimination; a State might reasonably conclude that the residual clause, strictly construed, covers only provisions using the term discrimination.

			"|"SOSSAMON v. TEXAS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 081438.Argued November 2, 2010Decided April 20, 2011
After this Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments because it exceeded Congress power under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.  RLUIPA targets two areas of state and local action: landuse regulation, RLUIPA 2, 42 U. S.C. 2000cc, and restrictions on the religious exercise of institutionalized persons, RLUIPA 3, 2000cc1.  It also provides an express private cause of action for appropriate relief against a government, 2000cc2(a), including, inter alia, States, their instrumentalities and officers, and persons acting under color of state law, 2000cc5(4)(A).


Petitioner Sossamon, a Texas prison inmate, sued respondents, the State and prison officials, seeking injunctive and monetary relief under RLUIPA for prison policies that prevented inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions and that barred use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  Granting respondents summary judgment, the District Court held that sovereign immunity barred Sossamons claims for monetary relief.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the statutory phrase appropriate relief against a government did not unambiguously notify Texas that its acceptance of federal funds was conditioned on a waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for monetary relief.
Held:States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA.  Pp.414.
(a)Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important constitutional limitation on the power of the federal courts.  See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98.  This Court has consistently made clear that federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.  Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54.  A State, however, may choose to waive its immunity.  Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447448.  The test for determining whether [it has done so] is a stringent one.  College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675.  The States consent to suit must be unequivocally expressed in the relevant statutes text.  Pennhurst, supra, at 99.  A waiver will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.  Lane v. Pe&nacute;a, 518 U. S. 187, 192.  Pp.46.


(b)RLUIPAs authorization of appropriate relief against a government, is not an unequivocal expression of state consent.  Pp.610.


(1)Appropriate relief is open-ended and ambiguous about the relief it includes.  Appropriate is inherently context-dependent.  And the context herewhere the defendant is a sovereignsuggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not suitable or proper.  See Federal Maritime Commn v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 765.  Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity.

09-987|"ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v. WINN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09987.Argued November 3, 2010Decided April 4, 2011
Respondents, Arizona taxpayers, sued petitioner Director of the State Department of Revenue, challenging Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 431089 on Establishment Clause grounds.  The Arizona law gives tax credits for contributions to school tuition organizations, or STOs, which then use the contributions to provide scholarships to students attending private schools, including religious schools.  Petitioner Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization and others later intervened.  The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents had standing as taxpayers under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, and had stated an Establishment Clause claim.
Held:Because respondents challenge a tax credit as opposed to a governmental expenditure, they lack Article III standing under Flast v. Cohen, supra.  Pp.419.
(a)Article III vests in the Federal Judiciary the Power to resolve Cases and Controversies.  That language limits the Federal Judiciary to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts: redressing injuries resulting from a specific legal dispute.  To obtain a ruling on the merits in federal court a plaintiff must assert more than just the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance.  Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 217.  Instead the plaintiff must establish standing, which requires an injury in fact; a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and a conclusion that it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561.  Pp.46.


(b)In general, the mere fact that someone is a taxpayer does not provide standing to seek relief in federal court.  The typical assertion of taxpayer standing rests on unjustifiable economic and political speculation.  See Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447; Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429.  When a government expends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily suffer.  Even assuming the States coffers are depleted, finding injury would require a court to speculate that elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiffs tax bill to make up a deficit.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 344.  And to find redressability a court must assume that, were the taxpayers remedy allowed, legislators [would] pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.  Ibid.  These conclusions apply to the present cases.  The costs of education may be a significant portion of Arizonas annual budget, but the tax credit, by facilitating the operation of both religious and secular private schools, could relieve the burden on public schools and provide cost savings to the State.  Even if the tax credit had an adverse effect on Arizonas budget, causation and redressability problems would remain.  To find a particular injury in fact would require speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by increasing respondents tax liability.  A causation finding would depend on the additional assumption that any tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credit.  And respondents have not established that an injunction against the credits application would prompt Arizona legislators to pass along [any] increased revenue [as] tax reductions.  Ibid.  Pp.610.


(c)Respondents suit does not fall within the narrow exception to the rule against taxpayer standing established in Flast v. Cohen, supra.  There, federal taxpayers had standing to mount an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal statute providing General Treasury funds to support, inter alia, textbook purchases for religious schools.  To have standing under Flast, taxpayers must show (1) a logical link between the plaintiffs taxpayer status and the type of legislative enactment attacked, and (2) a nexus between such taxpayer status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.  392 U. S., at 102.  Considering the two requirements together, Flast explained that individuals suffer a particular injury when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of the taxing and spending power, their property is transferred through the Governments Treasury to a sectarian entity.  Id., at 105106.  The taxpayers allegation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.  Id., at 106.  The STO tax credit does not visit the injury identified in Flast.  When the Government spends funds from the General Treasury, dissenting taxpayers know that they have been made to contribute to an establishment in violation of conscience.  In contrast, a tax credit allows dissenting taxpayers to use their own funds in accordance with their own consciences.  Here, the STO tax credit does not extrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious dissenters funds in service of an establishment, 392 U. S.em>., at 106, or force a citizen to contribute to a sectarian organization, id., at 103.  Rather, taxpayers are free to pay their own tax bills without contributing to an STO, to contribute to a religious or secular STO of their choice, or to contribute to other charitable organizations.  Because the STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax, respondents have not alleged an injury for standing purposes.  Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability.  When the government collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth; the resulting subsidy of religious activity is, under Flast, traceable to the governments expenditures; and an injunction against those expenditures would address taxpayer-plaintiffs objections of conscience.  Here, by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds.  Private citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs.  Any injury the objectors may suffer are not fairly traceable to the government.  And, while an injunction most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.  Pp.1016.


(d)Respondents contrary positionthat Arizonans benefiting from the tax credit in effect are paying their state income tax to STOsassumes that all income is government property, even if it has not come into the tax collectors hands.  That premise finds no basis in standing jurisprudence.  This Court has sometimes reached the merits in Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits as opposed to governmental expenditures.  See Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388; Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U. S. 1; Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734; Walz v. Tax Commn of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664.  But those cases did not mention standing and so do not stand for the proposition that no jurisdictional defects existed.  Moreover, it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio standing determinations in those cases depended on Flast, as there are other ways of establishing standing in Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits.  Pp.1618.
562 F.3d 1002, reversed.

09-1273|"ASTRA USA, INC., etal. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 091273.Argued January 19, 2011Decided March 29, 2011
Section 340B of the Public Health Services Act imposes ceilings on prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to specified health care facilities (340B or covered entities), dominantly, local providers of medical care for the poor.  The 340B ceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs.  To qualify for participation in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on their Medicaid drug purchases.  The amount of the rebates depends on a manufacturers average and best prices, as defined by legislation and regulation.  The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism.  The 340B Program also draws on the larger schemes pricing methodology.  In the 340B Programs contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the average and best prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate Program.


HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered entity to reimburse that entity.  HRSA may also terminate the manufacturers PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturers eligibility for Medicaid coverage of its drugs.  Currently, HRSA handles overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secretary to develop formal procedures.  Once those procedures are in place, HRSA will reach an administrative resolution, which will be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  In addition to authorizing compensation awards to overcharged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary penalties payable to the Government.


Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical companies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in violation of the PPAs.  Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs intended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for breach of contract.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B entities.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.
Held: Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incompatible with the statutory regime.  As the County has conceded, covered entities have no right of action under 340B itself.  Congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.  Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts enforceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries.  This argument overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufacturers agreement to abide by them.  The agreements have no negotiable terms.  Like the Medicaid Rebate Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme.  A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself.  Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the 340B ceiling price, not that they violated an independent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.
The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the Countys would spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the Government.  But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the interdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program.  Suits by 340B entities would undermine the agencys efforts to administer these two programs harmoniously and uniformly.  Notably, the Medicaid Rebate Programs statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for its drugs.  Had Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely would not have barred them from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.  


The Ninth Circuit noted that HHSs Office of the Inspector General has reported on HRSAs inadequate enforcement authority.  But Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits.  Instead, Congress opted to strengthen and formalize HRSAs enforcement authority, to make the new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities complaints, and to render the agencys resolution of those complaints binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs.  To qualify for participation in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on their Medicaid drug purchases.  The amount of the rebates depends on a manufacturers average and best prices, as defined by legislation and regulation.  The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism.  The 340B Program also draws on the larger schemes pricing methodology.  In the 340B Programs contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the average and best prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate Program.


HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered entity to reimburse that entity.  HRSA may also terminate the manufacturers PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturers eligibility for Medicaid coverage of its drugs.  Currently, HRSA handles overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secretary to develop formal procedures.  Once those procedures are in place, HRSA will reach an administrative resolution, which will be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  In addition to authorizing compensation awards to overcharged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary penalties payable to the Government.


Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical companies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in violation of the PPAs.  Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs intended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for breach of contract.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B entities.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.
Held: Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incompatible with the statutory regime.  As the County has conceded, covered entities have no right of action under 340B itself.  Congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.  Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts enforceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries.  This argument overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufacturers agreement to abide by them.  The agreements have no negotiable terms.  Like the Medicaid Rebate Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme.  A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself.  Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the 340B ceiling price, not that they violated an independent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.
The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the Countys would spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the Government.  But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the interdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program.  Suits by 340B entities would undermine the agencys efforts to administer these two programs harmoniously and uniformly.  Notably, the Medicaid Rebate Programs statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for its drugs.  Had Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely would not have barred them from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.  


The Ninth Circuit noted that HHSs Office of the Inspector General has reported on HRSAs inadequate enforcement authority.  But Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits.  Instead, Congress opted to strengthen and formalize HRSAs enforcement authority, to make the new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities complaints, and to render the agencys resolution of those complaints binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

10-797|"T. FELKNER v. STEVEN FRANK JACKSON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10797.Decided March 21, 2011
Per Curiam.

A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank Jackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his attack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment complex.  Jackson raised a Batson claim, asserting that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude black prospective jurors on the basis of their race.  See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).  Two of three black jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4950.


Jacksons counsel did not object when the prosecutor struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S.  Counsel later explained that he did not make a motion at that time because he thought the excusal of Juror S was a close call.  After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second juror, Juror J, Jacksons counsel made the Batson motion challenging both strikes.  Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 7677 (hereinafter Document 7).


The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by California police officers becausein his viewof his race and age.  As the prosecutor put it, Whether or not he still harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll the dice with.  Id., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 5758, 98100 (hereinafter Document 10).


The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because she had a masters degree in social work, and had interned at the county jail, probably in the psych unit as a sociologist of some sort.  The prosecutor explained that he dismissed her based on her educational background, stating that he does not like to keep social workers.  Document 7, at 7879; Document 10, at 188189; App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.


Jacksons counsel expressly disagreed only with the prosecutors explanation for the strike of Juror J, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 2223, 47, arguing that removing her on the basis of her educational background was itself invidious discrimination.  The prosecutor responded that he was not aware that social workers were a protected class.  As for Juror S, Jacksons counsel explained that he let [Juror S] slide because he anticipated the prosecutors response and, in any event, he only need[ed] one to establish the grounds for a Batson motion.  After listening to each sides arguments, the trial court denied Jacksons motion.  Document 7, at 7880.


Jackson renewed his Batson claim on direct appeal, arguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that the prosecutors explanations were pretextual.  With respect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a non-black jurorJuror 8also had negative experiences with law enforcement but remained on the jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4748.  Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years earlier as part of what he believed to be a scam by Illinois police targeting drivers with California license plates.  Juror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by the failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the burglary of his car.  Document 10, at 2627, 5657, 9597.


With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prosecutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors when he was concerned about their educational backgrounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any questions about her degree in social work.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.


The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial courts denial of the Batson motion and affirmed Jacksons convictions.  The appellate court explained that [t]he trial courts ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial evidence, App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation marks omitted), which the California courts have characterized as equivalent to the clear error standard employed by federal courts, see, e.g., People v. Alvarez, 14 Cal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P.2d 365, 389 (1996).  With respect to whether the prosecutors stated reasons were pretextual, the court explained that it give[s] great deference to the trial courts ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.


After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded that Juror 8s negative experience out of state and the car burglary is not comparable to [Juror Ss] 14 years of perceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on race.  Id., at 48.  As for Juror J, the court recognized that the prosecutors dismissal was based on her social services backgrounda proper race-neutral reasonand that this explained his different treatment of jurors with backgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental engineering.  The court also noted that the prosecutor focused on [Juror Js] internship experience at the county jail.  Id., at 49.


After the California Supreme Court denied Jacksons petition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief.  The Federal District Court properly recognized that review of Jacksons claim was governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  That law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2).  After considering the state Court of Appeal decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District Court held that the California Court of Appeals findings were not unreasonable.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24.  The District Court therefore denied Jacksons petition.


The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion.  389 Fed. Appx. 640 (2010).  In so doing, the court did not discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the other three courts that had rejected Jacksons claim.  Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Appeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its decision:
The prosecutors proffered race-neutral bases for peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purposeful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of three prospective African-American jurors were stricken, and the record reflected different treatment of comparably situated jurors.  Id., at 641.

That decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained.  It is reversed.


The Batson issue before us turns largely on an evaluation of credibility.  476 U. S., at 98, n. 21.  The trial courts determination is entitled to great deference, ibid., and must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous, Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (2008).


That is the standard on direct review.  On federal habeas review, AEDPA imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.  Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here the trial court credited the prosecutors race-neutral explanations, and the California Court of Appeal carefully reviewed the record at some length in upholding the trial courts findings.  The state appellate courts decision was plainly not unreasonable.  There was simply no basis for the Ninth Circuit to reach the opposite conclusion, particularly in such a dismissive manner.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

09-1163|"MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 091163.Argued December 1, 2010Decided March 7, 2011
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to make Government records available to the public, subject to nine exemptions.  This case concerns Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure material related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.  5 U. S.C.552(b)(2).  This provision replaced an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) exemption for any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency, 5 U. S.C. 1002 (1964 ed.).  Congress believed that the sweep of the phrase internal management had led to excessive withholding, and drafted Exemption 2 to have a narrower reach.  Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362363.


In Rose, the Court found that Exemption 2 could not be invoked to withhold Air Force Academy honor and ethics hearing summaries.  The exemption, the Court suggested, primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources.  But the Court stated a possible caveat: That understanding of the provisions coverage governed at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.  Id., at 369.  The D.C. Circuit subsequently converted this caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2s scope, finding that the exemption also covered any predominantly internal materials whose disclosure would significantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulation or statutes.  Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F.2d 1051, 10561057, 1074.  Courts now use the term Low 2 for human resources and employee relations records and High 2 for records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.  


Petitioner Milner submitted FOIA requests for explosives data and maps used by respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Government) in storing munitions at a naval base in Washington State.  Stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community, the Navy invoked Exemption 2 and refused to release the data.  The District Court granted the Navy summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2 interpretation.
Held:Because Exemption 2 encompasses only records relating to employee relations and human resources issues, the explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption.  Pp.619.
(a)Exemption 2 shields only those records relating to personnel rules and practices.  When used as an adjective in this manner, the key statutory word personnel refers to human resources matters.  For example, a personnel department deals with employee problems and interviews applicants for jobs.  FOIA Exemption 6 provides another example, protecting certain personnel  files from disclosure.  552(b)(6).  [T]he common and congressional meaning of  personnel file is a file maintained by a human resources office collecting personal information about employees, such as examination results and work performance evaluations.  Rose, supra, at 377.  Exemption 2 uses personnel in the exact same way.  An agencys personnel rules and practices all share a critical feature: They concern conditions of employment in federal agenciessuch matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.  These items currently fall within the so-called Low 2 exemption.  And under this Courts construction of the statutory language, Low 2 is all of 2.


FOIAs purpose reinforces this reading.  The statutes goal is broad disclosure, and the exemptions must be given a narrow compass.  Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151.  A narrow construction stands on especially firm footing with respect to Exemption 2, which was intended to hem in the expansive withholding that occurred under the prior APA exemption for internal management records.


Exemption 2, as interpreted here, does not reach the requested explosives information.  The data and maps, which calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations, in no way relate to personnel rules and practices, as that term is most naturally understood.  Pp.610.


(b)The Governments two alternative readings of Exemption 2 cannot be squared with the statute.  Pp.1017.


(c)While the Navy has a strong security interest in shielding the explosives data and maps from public disclosure, the Government has other tools at hand to protect such information: FOIA Exemption 1 prevents access to classified documents; Exemption 3 applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure; and Exemption 7 protects information compiled for law enforcement purposes if its release, inter alia, could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual, 552(b)(7)(F).  The Navys argument that the explosives information is exempt under Exemption 7 remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.  And if these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would threaten the Nations vital interests, the Government may of course seek relief from Congress.  Pp.1718.
 575 F.3d 959, reversed and remanded.

09-834|"KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE
PLASTICS CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 09834.Argued October 13, 2010Decided March 22, 2011
Petitioner Kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former employer, respondent (Saint-Gobain), under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act), which provides minimum wage, maximum hour, and overtime pay rules; and which forbids employers to discharge  any employee because such employee has filed any complaint alleging a violation of the Act, 29 U. S.C. 215(a)(3).  In a related suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing work-related protective gear.  In this suit Kasten claims that he was discharged because he orally complained to company officials about the timeclocks.  The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary judgment, concluding that the Acts antiretaliation provision did not cover oral complaints.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:The scope of statutory term filed any complaint includes oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.415.
(a)The interpretation of the statutory phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the [statutes] purpose and context  , and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.  Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486.  The text, taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer here.  Some dictionary definitions of filed contemplate a writing while others permit using file in conjunction with oral material.  In addition to dictionary definitions, state statutes and federal regulations sometimes contemplate oral filings, and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Acts passage.  Even if filed, considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings, any complaint suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.  Thus, the three-word phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question.  The Acts other references to filed also do not resolve the linguistic question.  Some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually always in writing; others specifically require a writing, and the remainder, like the provision here, leave the oral/written question unresolved.  Since filed any complaint lends itself linguistically to the broader, oral interpretation, the use of broader language in other statutes antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether Congress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.  Because the text, taken alone, might, or might not, encompass oral complaints, the Court must look further.  Pp.48.


(b)Several functional considerations indicate that Congress intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.814.


(1)A narrow interpretation would undermine the Acts basic objective, which is to prohibit labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers, 29 U. S.C. 202(a).  The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on information and complaints received from employees, Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292, and its antiretaliation provision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing fear of economic retaliation from inducing workers quietly to accept substandard conditions, ibid.  Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement schemes effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Acts complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers who were most in need of the Acts help at the time of passage?  Limiting the provisions scope to written complaints could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods to receive complaints.  And insofar as the provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.  The National Labor Relations Acts antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting workers who simply participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board investigation.  NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123.  The similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad interpretation of complaint.  The Acts requirement that an employer receive fair notice of an employees complaint can be met by oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.812.


(2)Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies, their views about the meaning of the phrase should be given a degree of weight.  The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view that filed any complaint covers both oral and written complaints.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in multiple briefs.  These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.  And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not post hoc rationalizatio[n].  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 50.  Pp.1213.


(3)After engaging in traditional statutory interpretation methods, the statute does not remain sufficiently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of lenity.  Pp.1314.


(c)This Court will not consider Saint-Gobains alternative claim that the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the Government, since that claim was not raised in the certiorari briefs and since its resolution is not a predicate to an intelligent resolution of the oral/written question at issue, Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n.13.  Pp.1415.
570 F.3d 834, vacated and remanded.

S.C. 202(a).  The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on information and complaints received from employees, Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292, and its antiretaliation provision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing fear of economic retaliation from inducing workers quietly to accept substandard conditions, ibid.  Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement schemes effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Acts complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers who were most in need of the Acts help at the time of passage?  Limiting the provisions scope to written complaints could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods to receive complaints.  And insofar as the provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.  The National Labor Relations Acts antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting workers who simply participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board investigation.  NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123.  The similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad interpretation of complaint.  The Acts requirement that an employer receive fair notice of an employees complaint can be met by oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.812.


(2)Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies, their views about the meaning of the phrase should be given a degree of weight.  The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view that filed any complaint covers both oral and written complaints.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in multiple briefs.  These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.  And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not post hoc rationalizatio[n].  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 50.  Pp.1213.


(3)After engaging in traditional statutory interpretation methods, the statute does not remain sufficiently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of lenity.  Pp.1314.


(c)This Court will not consider Saint-Gobains alternative claim that the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the Government, since that claim was not raised in the certiorari briefs and since its resolution is not a predicate to an intelligent resolution of the oral/written question at issue, Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n.13.  Pp.1415.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 09868.Argued November 29, 2010Decided March 7, 2011
Respondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.  His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996.  In addition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions.  One, a May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied.  The State Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998.  The second, a state postconviction relief motion, was also denied.  That decision was affirmed on December 14, 2006.  When respondent filed his federal habeas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) generally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), but a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review tolls that period, 2244(d)(2).  Respondents postconviction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule 35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas petition to be timely.  The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely, adopting the Magistrate Judges conclusion that the Rule 35 motion was not a properly filed application for  collateral review under 2244(d)(2).  The First Circuit reversed.
Held:
1.The phrase collateral review in 2244(d)(2) means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.  Pp.48.


(a)The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a motion to reduce sentence is an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review turns on the meaning of collateral review, but they disagree about what that meaning should be.  Pp.
45.  


(b)Because collateral review is not defined in AEDPA, the Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase.  By definition, collateral describes something that is indirect, not direct.  3 Oxford English Dictionary 473.  This suggests that collateral review is not part of direct review.  This conclusion is supported by the definition of the related phrase collateral attack and by the Courts prior use of the term collateral to describe proceedings that are separate from the direct review process.  Pp.57. 


(c)The term review is best understood as a judicial reexamination.  Websters Third New International Dictionary 1944.  Pp.
78. 


2.A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is an application for collateral review that triggers AEDPAs tolling provision.  Pp.815.


(a)Rhode Islands Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as relevant here, to reduce any sentence, and it is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice.  Under the limited review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justices decision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses.  Pp.89. 


(b)Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is collateral.  The parties agree that the motion is not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old Federal Rule 35 as invoking a collateral remedy.  Therefore, it is not difficult to conclude that Rhode Islands motion to reduce sentence is collateral.  A Rule 35 motion also calls for review of the sentence within 2244(d)(2)s meaning.  The decision to reduce a sentence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.  The trial justice is guided by several sentencing factors in making that decision.  And those factors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial justices justifications for the sentence.  Pp.911.


(c)Rhode Islands arguments in support of its opposing view that collateral review includes only legal challenges to a conviction or sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence reduction, are unpersuasive.  Nor does collateral review turn on whether a motion is part of the same criminal case.  Pp.1115.

09-6822|"PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 096822.Argued December 6, 2010Decided March 2, 2011
After pleading guilty to drug charges, petitioner Pepper was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to 24 months imprisonment, a nearly 75 percent downward departure from the low end of the Guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance, followed by five years of supervised release.  In Pepper I, the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of, inter alia, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220.  Pepper, who had begun serving his supervised release, testified at his resentencing hearing that he was no longer a drug addict, having completed a 500-hour drug treatment program while in prison; that he was enrolled in community college and had achieved very good grades; and that he was working part time.  Peppers father testified that he and his son were no longer estranged, and Peppers probation officer testified that a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Peppers substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low recidivism risk.  The District Court again sentenced Pepper to 24 months, granting a 40 percent downward departure based on Peppers substantial assistance and a further downward variance based on, inter alia, Peppers rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.  In Pepper II, the Eighth Circuit again reversed and remanded for resentencing, concluding that Peppers postsentencing rehabilitation could not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance, and directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge.  After this Court vacated and remanded the Pepper II judgment in light of Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, the Eighth Circuit, in Pepper III, reversed and remanded once more.  At the second resentencing hearing, Pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in school, was about to be promoted at his job, and had married and was supporting his new family.  Noting the nearly identical remand language of Pepper II and Pepper III, the court observed that it was not bound to reduce Peppers range by 40 percent for substantial assistance.  Instead, it found him entitled to a 20 percent reduction and refused to grant a further downward variance for, inter alia, postsentencing rehabilitation.  It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12 months of supervised release.  In Pepper IV, the Eighth Circuit once again rejected Peppers postsentencing rehabilitation argument.  It also rejected his claim that the law of the case from Pepper II and Pepper III required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40 percent.  
Held:
1.When a defendants sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendants postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guidelines range.  Pp.927.


(a)Consistent with the principle that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime, Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law, id., at 246, particularly the fullest information possible concerning the defendants life and characteristics, id., at 247.  That principle is codified at 18 U. S.C. 3661, which provides that [n]o limitation shall be placed on the information a sentencing court may consider concerning the [defendants] background, character, and conduct, and at 3553(a), which specifies that sentencing courts must consider, among other things, a defendants history and characteristics, 3553(a)(1).  The Guidelines, which Booker made effectively advisory, 543 U. S., at 245, should be the starting point and the initial benchmark, but district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the 3553(a) factors, subject to appellate review for reasonableness, Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 4951.  This sentencing framework applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal.  Pp.912.


(b)Postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.  The plain language of 3661 makes clear that there is [n]o limitation  on  background, character, and conduct information, and it makes no distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing.  In addition, postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be highly relevant to several 3553(a) factors that district courts are required to consider at sentencing.  The extensive evidence of Peppers rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence here.  Most fundamentally, that evidence provides the most up-to-date picture of his history and characteristics.  3553(a)(1).  At the time of his initial sentencing, he was an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family and sold drugs.  By his second resentencing, he had been drug-free for nearly five years, was attending college, was a top employee slated for promotion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and was married and supporting a family.  His postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must consider.  See 3553(a)(2)(B)(C).  Pp.1215.


(c)The contrary arguments advanced by amicus appointed to defend the judgment are unpersuasive.  Pp.1526. 


(1)While 3742(g)(2)which prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencingeffectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision is invalid after Booker.  Like the provisions invalidated in Booker3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)3742(g)(2) requires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases.  Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the provision.  While applying 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a partial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively mandatory in some cases and advisory in others.  The fact that 3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.  And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in 3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating 3742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.  Pp.1520.


(2)This Court finds unpersuasive amicus arguments focusing on Congress sentencing objectives under 3553(a).  Contrary to amicus contention, 3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.  Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Courts analysis of whether 3553(a) permits consideration of such evidence.  Nor is the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the sentencing factor in 3553(a)(5)which directs sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statement of the Sentencing Commissionparticularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant sentencing statutes.  Consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is also not inconsistent with 3553(a)(6)which requires courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conductas any disparity arises only from the normal trial and sentencing process.  The differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of unwarranted sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under 3553(a)(6).  Pp. 2126.


(d)On remand, the District Court should consider and give appropriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning Peppers conduct since his last sentencing.  Pp. 2627.


2.Because the Eighth Circuit in Pepper III set aside Peppers entire sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing, the District Court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the same 40 percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.  To avoid undermining a district courts original sentencing intent, an appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence may vacate the entire sentence  so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan  to satisfy [3553(a)s] sentencing factors.  Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 253.  That is what the Eighth Circuit did here.  Pp. 2730.

It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12 months of supervised release.  In Pepper IV, the Eighth Circuit once again rejected Peppers postsentencing rehabilitation argument.  It also rejected his claim that the law of the case from Pepper II and Pepper III required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40 percent.  
Held:
1.When a defendants sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendants postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guidelines range.  Pp.927.

(b)Postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.

His postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must consider.  See 3553(a)(2)(B)(C).  Pp.1215.

(1)While 3742(g)(2)which prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencingeffectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision is invalid after Booker.  Like the provisions invalidated in Booker3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)3742(g)(2) requires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases.  Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the provision.  While applying 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a partial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively mandatory in some cases and advisory in others.  The fact that 3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.  And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in 3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating 3742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.  Pp.1520.


(2)This Court finds unpersuasive amicus arguments focusing on Congress sentencing objectives under 3553(a).  Contrary to amicus contention, 3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.  Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Courts analysis of whether 3553(a) permits consideration of such evidence.  Nor is the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the sentencing factor in 3553(a)(5)which directs sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statement of the Sentencing Commissionparticularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant sentencing statutes.

S.C. 1983 or may assert the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.C. 2254.


A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons.  He claimed that a potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriends uncle as the likely perpetrator.  In preparation for trial, the State tested some of the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and certain hair samples.  More than six years later, Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.  Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested biological evidence.  Both motions were denied.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article 64.03(a)(2), that he would not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing.  The CCA affirmed the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previously tested through no fault on his part.


Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under 1983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to have tested.  Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA testing he requested.  The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postconviction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not under 1983.  Adopting that recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinners suit.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.
Held:There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinners complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under 1983.  Pp.715.
(a)Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a plausible short and plain statement of the plaintiffs claim, not an exposition of his legal argument.  Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleging that the States refusal to release the biological evidence for testing  deprived [him] of his liberty interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . His counsel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutors conduct or the CCAs decisions; instead, he challenges Texas postconviction DNA statute as construed by the Texas courts.  Pp.78.


(b)The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinners suit.  This Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it takes its name, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462.  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280.  Given the narrow ground the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has confined Rooker-Feldman to cases  brought by state-court losers  inviting district court review and rejection of [a state courts] judgments.  Ibid.  Skinners complaint encounters no Rooker-Feldman shoal.  If a federal plaintiff present[s] [an] independent claim, it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the same or a related question was earlier aired between the parties in state court.  Id., at 292293.  A state-court decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action.  See, e.g., Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487.  Because Skinners federal casewhich challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute they authoritatively construedfalls within the latter category, there was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.  Pp.810.


(c)Measured against this Courts prior holdings, Skinner has properly invoked 1983.  This Court has several times considered when a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pursue a civil rights claim under 1983, and when habeas corpus is the prisoners sole remedy.  The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a 1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.  This Court held that 1983 was not an available remedy because any award in the plaintiffs favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.  See id., at 487.  In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held that prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under 1983, for they sought no injunction ordering  immediate or speedier release into the community, id., at 82, and a favorable judgment [would] not necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s], ibid.  Here, success in Skinners suit for DNA testing would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.  Test results might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevitable, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.  Switzer argues that, although Skinners immediate aim is DNA testing, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought would not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce the custody level.  Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in the Circuits that currently allow 1983 claims for DNA testing, there has been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evidence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment.  The projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims.  More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits in order to prevent sportive federal-court filings.  Nor is there cause for concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.  Brady, which announced a constitutional requirement addressed to the prosecutions conduct pretrial, proscribes withholding evidence favorable to an accused and material to [his] guilt or to punishment.  Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or inconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evidence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of 1983.  Pp.1014.


(d)Switzers several arguments why Skinners complaint should fail for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for consideration on remand.  P. 14.

09-1036|"HENDERSON, authorized representative of HENDERSON, DECEASED v. SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 091036.Argued December 6, 2010Decided March 1, 2011
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for adjudicating veterans benefits claims for service-connected disabilities: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review in the Board of Veterans Appeals.  Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further review, but the Veterans Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribunal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans.  A veteran must file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date when the Boards final decision is properly mailed.  38 U. S.C. 7266(a).


After the VA denied David Hendersons claim for supplemental disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court, missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  Henderson argued that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable tolling principles.  While his appeal was pending, this Court decided Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, which held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case is jurisdictional, so that a partys failure to file within that period could not be excused.  The Veterans Court concluded that Bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed Hendersons untimely appeal.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional consequences.  Pp.413.
(a)Branding a procedural rule as going to a courts subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.  Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  Jurisdictional rules may also cause a waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since objections may be raised at any time, even after trial.  Because of these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a courts adjudicatory capacity, i.e., its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.  E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Among the rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are claim-processing rules, which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.  Although filing deadlines are quintessential claim-processing rules, Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, applied a readily administrable bright line rule to determine whether Congress has done so: There must be a clear indication that Congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional.  Id., at 515516.  [C]ontext, including this Courts interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant, Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___, to whether Congress has spoken clearly on this point.  Pp.46.


(b)Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline here be jurisdictional.  Pp.712.


(1)None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here.  All of the cases they citee.g., Bowles, supra; Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386; and Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467involved review by Article III courts.  This case, by contrast, involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme.  Instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions, this Court attempts to ascertain Congress intent regarding the particular type of review at issue.  Pp.78.  


(2)Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant to be jurisdictional.  The terms of 7266(a), which sets the deadline, provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences.  It neither speaks in jurisdictional terms nor refers in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court], Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394.  Nor does 7266s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication.  Its placement in a subchapter entitled Procedure, and not in the subchapter entitled Organization and Jurisdiction, suggests that Congress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule.  Most telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans benefits claims.  Congress longstanding solicitude for veterans, United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veterans favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions.  The contrast between ordinary civil litigationwhich provided the context in Bowlesand the system Congress created for veterans is dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be commenced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adversarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  By contrast, a veteran need not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA proceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veterans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence.  A veteran who loses before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a Board decision in the veterans favor is final.  And a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply with this scheme.  Particularly in light of the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries favor, King v. St. Vincents Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 220221, n.9, this Court sees no clear indication that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag.  Contrary to the Governments argument, the lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help in interpreting 7266(a).  Section 7266(a) was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.  Pp.812.

09-400|"STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 09400.Argued November 2, 2010Decided March 1, 2011
While employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army Reserve.  Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulallys supervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations.  Mulally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive requiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were completed.  After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had violated the Corrective Action, Proctors vice president of human resources (Buck) reviewed Staubs personnel file and decided to fire him.  Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision.  Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to deny employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment based on a persons membership in or obligation to perform service in a uniformed service, 38 U. S.C. 4311(a), and provides that liability is established if the persons membership  is a motivating factor in the employers action, 4311(c).  He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostility to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were, and that their actions influenced Bucks decision.  A jury found Proctor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulallys and Korenchuks advice in making her decision.  
Held:
1.If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.  In construing the phrase motivating factor in the employers action, this Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.  See, e.g., Burlington N. & S. F.R.Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Intentional torts such as the one here generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act, not simply the act itself.  Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 6162.  However, Proctor errs in contending that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is motivated by discriminatory animus.  So long as the earlier agent intended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required for USERRA liability.  Moreover, it is axiomatic under tort law that the decisionmakers exercise of judgment does not prevent the earlier agents action from being the proximate cause of the harm.  See Hemi Group, LLC v.

			"|"STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 09400.Argued November 2, 2010Decided March 1, 2011
While employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army Reserve.  Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulallys supervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations.  Mulally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive requiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were completed.  After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had violated the Corrective Action, Proctors vice president of human resources (Buck) reviewed Staubs personnel file and decided to fire him.  Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision.  Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to deny employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment based on a persons membership in or obligation to perform service in a uniformed service, 38 U. S.C. 4311(a), and provides that liability is established if the persons membership  is a motivating factor in the employers action, 4311(c).  He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostility to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were, and that their actions influenced Bucks decision.  A jury found Proctor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulallys and Korenchuks advice in making her decision.  
Held:
1.If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.  In construing the phrase motivating factor in the employers action, this Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.  See, e.g., Burlington N. & S. F.R.Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Intentional torts such as the one here generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act, not simply the act itself.  Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 6162.  However, Proctor errs in contending that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is motivated by discriminatory animus.  So long as the earlier agent intended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required for USERRA liability.  Moreover, it is axiomatic under tort law that the decisionmakers exercise of judgment does not prevent the earlier agents action from being the proximate cause of the harm.  See Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U. S. 1, ___.  Nor can the ultimate decisionmakers judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm.  See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837.  Proctors approach would have an improbable consequence: If an employer isolates a personnel official from its supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employees personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce the adverse action.  Proctor also errs in arguing that a decisionmakers independent investigation, and rejection, of an employees discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the prior discrimination.

09-751|"SNYDER v. PHELPS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 09751.Argued October 6, 2010Decided March 2, 2011
For the past 20 years, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that God hates the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in Americas military.  The churchs picketing has also condemned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy.  Fred Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishioners (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in the line of duty.  The picketing took place on public land approximately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in accordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers.  The picketers peacefully displayed their signsstating, e.g., Thank God for Dead Soldiers, Fags Doom Nations, America is Doomed, Priests Rape Boys, and Youre Going to Hellfor about 30 minutes before the funeral began.  Matthew Snyders father (Snyder), petitioner here, saw the tops of the picketers signs when driving to the funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watching a news broadcast later that night.  


Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughterswho participated in the picketingand the church (collectively Westboro) alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy.  A jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.  Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly excessive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the First Amendment fully protected its speech.  The District Court reduced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise intact.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboros statements were entitled to First Amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.
Held:The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.  Pp.515.
(a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment can serve as a defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 50-51.  Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of the case.  [S]peech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values and is entitled to special protection.  Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145.  Although the boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern are not well defined, this Court has said that speech is of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, id., at 146, or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public, San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 8384.  A statements arguably inappropriate or controversial character  is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.  Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387.  Pp.57.


To determine whether speech is of public or private concern, this Court must independently examine the content, form, and context, of the speech as revealed by the whole record.  Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 761.    In considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech.  Pp.78.


The content of Westboros signs plainly relates to public, rather than private, matters.  The placards highlighted issues of public importthe political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergyand Westboro conveyed its views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public audience as possible.  Even if a few of the signs were viewed as containing messages related to a particular individual, that would not change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboros demonstration spoke to broader public issues.  P.8.


The context of the speechits connection with Matthew Snyders funeralcannot by itself transform the nature of Westboros speech.  The signs reflected Westboros condemnation of much in modern society, and it cannot be argued that Westboros use of speech on public issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on Snyder from liability.  Westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the picketing did not represent Westboros honestly held beliefs on public issues.  Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase publicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly hurtful to Snyder.  That does not mean that its speech should be afforded less than full First Amendment protection under the circumstances of this case.  Pp.810.


That said, [e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.  Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 479.  Westboros choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the Governments regulatory reachit is subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions.  Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293.  The facts here are quite different, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited situations where the Court has concluded that the location of targeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed content neutral.  Frisby, supra, at 477; Madsen v. Womens Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 768, distinguished.  Maryland now has a law restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the time of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider whether that law is a reasonable time, place, or manner restrictio[n] under the standards announced by this Court.  Clark, supra, at 293.  Pp.1012.


The special protection afforded to what Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous for purposes of applying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish Westboro for its views on matters of public concern.  For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.  Pp.1213.


(b)Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion.  He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his sons funeral, but the captive audience doctrinewhich has been applied sparingly, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736738; Frisby, supra, at 484485should not be expanded to the circumstances here.  Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers signs, and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself.  Pp.1314.


(c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusionthe allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accomplishSnyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.  P.14.


(d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.  It did not disrupt Mathew Snyders funeral, and its choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.  Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled, Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this case.  Pp.1415.
580 F.3d 206, affirmed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

09-1279|"FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION etal. v. AT&T INC. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 091279.Argued January 19, 2011Decided March 1, 2011
The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make records and documents publicly available upon request, subject to several statutory exemptions.  One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C), covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  5 U. S.C. 552(b)(7)(C).  CompTel, a trade association, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&T had provided to the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau during an investigation of that company.  The Bureau found that Exemption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&Ts submissions but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not have personal privacy interests as required by the exemption.  The FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit did not.  It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the personal privacy of corporations, reasoning that personal is the adjective form of the term person, which Congress has defined, as applicable here, to include corporations, 551(2).
Held:Corporations do not have personal privacy for the purposes of Exemption 7(C).  Pp.312.
(a)AT&T argues that the word personal in Exemption 7(C) incorporates the statutory definition of person, which includes corporations, 551(2).  But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns.  Person is a defined term in the statute; personal is not.  When a statute does not define a term, the Court typically give[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.  Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Personal ordinarily refers to individuals.  People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspondence of corporations.  In fact, personal is often used to mean precisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a companys view.  Dictionary definitions also suggest that personal does not ordinarily relate to artificial persons like corporations.


AT&T contends that its reading of personal is supported by the common legal usage of the word person.  Yet while person, in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&Ts effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to personal again elides the difference between person and personal.  AT&T provides scant support for the proposition that personal denotes corporations, even in a legal context.


Regardless of whether personal can carry a legal meaning apart from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed in light of the terms surrounding it.  Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.  Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word personal, but to the term personal privacy.  Personal in that phrase conveys more than just of a person; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human concernsnot the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&T.  AT&T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly referred to a corporations personal privacy.  Nor does it identify any other statute that does so.  While AT&T argues that this Court has recognized privacy interests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for the Court to pass on the scope of a corporations privacy interests as a matter of constitutional or common law.  AT&T contends that the FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase personal privacy necessarily excludes corporations privacy.  But construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining the outer limits of [a words] definitional possibilities, Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.  Pp.39.


(b)The meaning of personal privacy in Exemption 7(C) is further clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions.  Exemption 6, which Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  552(b)(6).  This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as involving an individuals right of privacy, Department of State v. Ray, 502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same phrasepersonal privacyused in Exemption 6.  In contrast, FOIA Exemption 4, which protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, 552(b)(4), clearly applies to corporations.  Congress did not use any language similar to that in Exemption 4 in Exemption 7(C).  Pp.911.
582 F.3d 490, reversed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Kagan, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

S. 481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.  Pp.39.


(b)The meaning of personal privacy in Exemption 7(C) is further clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions.  Exemption 6, which Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  552(b)(6).  This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as involving an individuals right of privacy, Department of State v. Ray, 502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same phrasepersonal privacyused in Exemption 6.  In contrast, FOIA Exemption 4, which protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, 552(b)(4), clearly applies to corporations.  Congress did not use any language similar to that in Exemption 4 in Exemption 7(C).  Pp.911.

09-150|"MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
certiorari to the supreme court of michigan
No. 09150.Argued October 5, 2010Decided February 28, 2011
Michigan police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found Anthony Covington mortally wounded.  Covington told them that he had been shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryants house and had then driven himself to the lot.  At trial, which occurred before Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, were decided, the officers testified about what Covington said.  Bryant was found guilty of, inter alia, second-degree murder.  Ultimately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding that the Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause, as explained in Crawford and Davis, rendered Covingtons statements inadmissible testimonial hearsay. 
Held: Covingtons identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they had a primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  Davis, 547 U. S., at 822.  Therefore, their admission at Bryants trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.532.
(a)In Crawford, this Court held that in order for testimonial evidence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment demands  unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  541 U. S., at 68.  Crawford did not spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial, but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among other things, police interrogations.  Ibid.  Thus, Sylvia Crawfords statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the accused, had no opportunity for cross-examination due to spousal privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation.  In Davis and Hammon, both domestic violence cases, the Court explained that [s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [interrogations] primary purpose  is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, but they are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the [interrogations] primary purpose is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. 547 U. S., at 822.  Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in Davis, where the victims elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve [the ongoing] emergency, and the statements were not formal.  Id., at 827.  But the statements in Hammon were testimonial, where the victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her husband and deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning the past events.  Id., at 830.  Here, the context is a nondomestic dispute, with the ongoing emergency extending beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public.  This context requires additional clarification of what Davis meant by the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  Id., at 822.  Pp.512.


(b)To make the primary purpose determination, the Court must objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter between the individual and the police occurs and the parties statements and actions.  Pp.1223.


(1)The primary purpose inquiry is objective.  The circumstances in which an encounter occurse.g., at or near a crime scene versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwardsare clearly matters of objective fact.  And the relevant inquiry into the parties statements and actions is not the subjective or actual purpose of the particular parties, but the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the parties statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.  P.13.


(2)The existence of an ongoing emergency at the time of the encounter is among the most important circumstances informing the interrogations primary purpose.  See, e.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 828830.  An emergency focuses the participants not on prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution, id., at 822, but on end[ing] a threatening situation, id., at 832.  The Michigan Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.  An assessment of whether an emergency threatening the police and public is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public may continue.  The State Supreme Court also did not appreciate that an emergencys duration and scope may depend in part on the type of weapon involved; the court below relied on Davis and Hammon, where the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an emergency involving a gun.  A victims medical condition is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the victims ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a testimonial one.  It also provides important context for first responders to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the victim, themselves, and the public.  This does not mean that an emergency lasts the entire time that a perpetrator is on the loose, but trial courts can determine in the first instance when an interrogation transitions from nontestimonial to testimonial.  Finally, whether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor informing the ultimate inquiry regarding an interrogations primary purpose.  Another is the encounters informality.  Formality suggests the absence of an emergency, but informality does not necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent.  The facts herethe questioning occurred in an exposed, public area, before emergency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashiondistinguish this case from Crawfords formal station-house interrogation.  Pp.1420.


(3)The statements and actions of both the declarant and interrogators also provide objective evidence of the interrogations primary purpose. Looking to the contents of both the questions and the answers ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to one participant, since both interrogators and declarants may have mixed motives.  Police officers dual responsibilities as both first responders and criminal investigators may lead them to act with different motives simultaneously or in quick succession.  And during an ongoing emergency, victims may want the threat to end, but may not envision prosecution.  Alternatively, a severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in answering questions.  Taking into account such injuries does not make the inquiry subjective.  The inquiry still focuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the actual victims circumstances, which prominently include the victims physical state.  Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all participants is also consistent with this Courts prior holdings.  E.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822823, n.1.  Pp.2023. 


(c)Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the statements and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate that the interrogations primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, 547 U. S., at 822.  The circumstances of the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown and who had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where police found Covington.  Unlike the emergencies in Davis and Hammon, this disputes potential scope and thus the emergency encompassed a potential threat to the police and the public.  And since this case involved a gun, the physical separation that was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was not necessarily sufficient to end the threat here.  Informed by the circumstances of the ongoing emergency, the Court now turns to determining the primary purpose of the interrogation as evidenced by the statements and actions of Covington and the police.  The circumstances of the encounter provide important context for understanding Covingtons statements to the police.  When he responded to their questions, he was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound, and his answers were punctuated with questions about when emergency medical services would arrive.  Thus, this Court cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a primary purpose to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.  Ibid.  For their part, the police responded to a call that a man had been shot.  They did not know why, where, or when the shooting had occurred; the shooters location; or anything else about the crime.  They asked exactly the type of questions necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing emergency.  Ibid.  Nothing in Covingtons responses indicated to the police that there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended.  Finally, this situation is more similar to the informal, harried 911 call in Davis than to the structured, station-house interview in Crawford.  The officers all arrived at different times; asked, upon arrival, what had happened; and generally did not conduct a structured interrogation.  The informality suggests that their primary purpose was to address what they considered to be an ongoing emergency, and the circumstances lacked a formality that would have alerted Covington to or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.  Pp. 2332.

No. 09150.Argued October 5, 2010Decided February 28, 2011
Michigan police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found Anthony Covington mortally wounded.  Covington told them that he had been shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryants house and had then driven himself to the lot.  At trial, which occurred before Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.

Ultimately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding that the Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause, as explained in Crawford and Davis, rendered Covingtons statements inadmissible testimonial hearsay. 
Held: Covingtons identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they had a primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.

(a)In Crawford, this Court held that in order for testimonial evidence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment demands  unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  541 U. S., at 68.  Crawford did not spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial, but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among other things, police interrogations.  Ibid.  Thus, Sylvia Crawfords statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the accused, had no opportunity for cross-examination due to spousal privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation.  In Davis and Hammon, both domestic violence cases, the Court explained that [s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [interrogations] primary purpose  is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, but they are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the [interrogations] primary purpose is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. 547 U.

Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in Davis, where the victims elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve [the ongoing] emergency, and the statements were not formal.  Id., at 827.  But the statements in Hammon were testimonial, where the victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her husband and deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning the past events.

This context requires additional clarification of what Davis meant by the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  Id., at 822.  Pp.512.


(b)To make the primary purpose determination, the Court must objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter between the individual and the police occurs and the parties statements and actions.  Pp.1223.


(1)The primary purpose inquiry is objective.  The circumstances in which an encounter occurse.g., at or near a crime scene versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwardsare clearly matters of objective fact.

(c)Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the statements and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate that the interrogations primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, 547 U.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09996.Argued November 29, 2010Decided February 23, 2011
While most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief applications, California courts appl[y] a general reasonableness standard to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed, Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 222.  Under that standard, a [habeas] petition should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow  , Inre Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n.5, 855 P.2d 729, 738, n.5.  Three decisions, Clark, Inre Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P.2d 311, and Inre Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P.2d 290, describe Californias timeliness requirement.  A prisoner must seek habeas relief without substantial delay, e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P.3d, at 317, as measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasonably should have known, of the information offered in support of the claim and the legal basis of the claim, id., at 787, 959 P.2d, at 322.  All California courts have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings.  Cal. Const., Art.VI, 10.  Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Supreme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas petitions each year.  A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means that the petition is rejected as untimely.  California courts, however, have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily reject the petition for want of merit.  


Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  After the California Supreme Court denied Martins first state habeas petition, he filed a federal habeas petition.  The District Court ordered a stay to permit Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims he had not previously aired.  Martin raised those claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court, but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final.  The California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Robbins.  Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an amended federal habeas petition.  The District Court dismissed his belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law.  The Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to determine the adequacy of the States time bar.  Again rejecting Martins petition, the District Court found Californias bar an adequate state ground for denying Martins new pleas.  Concluding that the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martins claims.  
Held:Californias timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.  Pp.713.
(a)Absent showings of cause and prejudice, see Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 8485, federal habeas relief will be unavailable when (1) a state court [has] declined to address a prisoners federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement, and (2) the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds, Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729730.  P.7.


(b)A rule can be firmly established and regularly followed, and therefore adequate, even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.  Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___.  Californias time rule, although discretionary, meets this firmly established criterion.  The California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of cases, instructing habeas petitioners to alleg[e] with specificity the absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to the time bar.  Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P.2d, at 299.  And Californias case law made it plain that Martins nearly five-year delay was substantial.  See, e.g., id., at 829831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P.2d, at 293294, 299, and n.13.  The Court finds unpersuasive Martins argument that the terms reasonable time period and substantial delay make Californias rule too vague to be regarded as firmly established.  While indeterminate language is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particular circumstances can supply the requisite clarity.  Congressional statutes and this Courts decisions have employed time limitations that are not stated in precise, numerical terms.  For example, current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one year.  The clock runs from the date on which the [supporting] facts  could have been discovered through  due diligence.  28 U. S.C. 2255(f)(4).  Although due diligence is an inexact measure of how much delay is too much, Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S. 295, 309, n. 7, use of an imprecise standard is no justification for depriving [a rules] language of any meaning, ibid.  Nor is Californias time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins.  Contrary to Martins argument, Californias time bar is not infirm simply because a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case.  Discretion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an unyielding rule.  A state ground may be found inadequate when a court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner, but Martin makes no such contention here.  Pp.712.


(c)This decision leaves unaltered the Courts repeated recognition that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural requirements to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against claims of federal rights.  See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala., 338 U. S. 294, 298299.  On the record here, however, there is no basis for concluding that Californias rule operates in such a discriminatory manner.  P.13.

Contrary to Martins argument, Californias time bar is not infirm simply because a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case.  Discretion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an unyielding rule.  A state ground may be found inadequate when a court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner, but Martin makes no such contention here.  Pp.712.


(c)This decision leaves unaltered the Courts repeated recognition that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural requirements to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against claims of federal rights.  See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala., 338 U. S. 294, 298299.  On the record here, however, there is no basis for concluding that Californias rule operates in such a discriminatory manner.

08-1314|"WILLIAMSON etal. v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC., etal.
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, fourth appellate district, division three
No. 081314.Argued November 3, 2010Decided February 23, 2011
The 1989 version of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208) requires, as relevant here, auto manufacturers to install seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles.  They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicles doors or frames, but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear inner seats, e.g., those next to a minivans aisle.


The Williamson family and Thanh Williamsons estate brought this California tort suit, claiming that Thanh died in an accident because the rear aisle seat of the Mazda minivan in which she was riding had a lap belt instead of lap-and-shoulder belts.  The state trial court dismissed their claim on the pleadings.  The State Court of Appeal affirmed, relying on Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, in which this Court found that an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS 208which required installation of passive restraint devicespre-empted a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to install airbags.
Held:FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, instead of lap belts, on rear inner seats.  Pp.312. 
(a)Because this case involves (1) the same statute as Geier, (2) a later version of the same regulation, and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation, the answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in Geier apply directly here.  Thus, the statutes express pre-emption clause cannot pre-empt the common-law tort action here; but neither can its saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption principles.  The Court consequently turns to Geiers third subsidiary question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.  Pp.35.


(b)Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a federal law is pre-empted.  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67.  In Geier, the state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant federal regulatory objective, namely, giving manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint systems.  This conclusion was supported by the regulations history, the agencys contemporaneous explanation, and the Governments current understanding of the regulation.  The history showed that the Department of Transportation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufacturers with a choice of systems.  DOTs contemporaneous explanation of the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an important means for achieving DOTs basic objectives.  It phased in passive restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and develop better systems; it worried that requiring airbags would cause a public backlash; and it was concerned about airbag safety and cost.  Finally, the Governments current understanding was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objectives.  529 U. S.em>., at 883.  Pp.58.


(c)Like the regulation in Geier, the instant regulation leaves the manufacturer with a choice, and the tort suit here would restrict that choice.  But in contrast to Geier, the choice here is not a significant regulatory objective.  The regulations history resembles the history of airbags to some degree.  DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats in 1984.  But by 1989, changed circumstances led DOT to require manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer choice for rear inner seats.  Its reasons for doing so differed considerably from its 1984 reasons for permitting a choice of passive restraint.  It was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it thought that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety and did not pose additional safety risks; and it was not seeking to use the regulation to spur development of alternative safety devices.  Instead, DOT thought that the requirement would not be cost effective.  That fact alone cannot show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits.  For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.  For another, many federal safety regulations embody a cost-effectiveness judgment.  To infer pre-emptive intent from the mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment would eliminate the possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum standard.  Finally, the Solicitor General represents that DOTs regulation does not pre-empt this tort suit.  As in Geier, the agencys own views should make a difference, 529 U. S., at 883, and DOT has not expressed inconsistent views on this subject.  Pp.812.

09-520|"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 09520.Argued November 10, 2010Decided February 22, 2011
Petitioner (CSX) is an interstate rail carrier that operates, and pays taxes, in Alabama.  The State imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts their main competitorsinterstate motor and water carriers.  CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama), claiming that this tax scheme discriminates against railroads in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4R Act or Act), which bars four forms of discriminatory taxation, 49 U. S.C. 11501(b).  Three of the delineated prohibitions deal with property taxes, 11501(b)(1)(3), and the fourth is a catch-all provision that forbids a State to [i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, 11501(b)(4).  The District Court dismissed CSXs suit as not cognizable under the 4R Act on the basis of this Courts decision in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:CSX may challenge Alabamas sales and use taxes under 11501(b)(4).  Pp.519.
(a)CSX is challenging another tax within subsection (b)(4)s plain meaning.  The Act does not define tax.  Thus, this Court looks to the words ordinary definition, which is expansive.  A State seeking to raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxation on property, income, transactions, or activities.  [A]nother tax is thus best understood to encompass any tax a State might impose, on any asset or transaction, except the property taxes already addressed in subsections (b)(1)(3).  There is no reason to interpret subsection (b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes that some States imposed in lieu of property taxes at the time of the Acts passage.  Moreover, CSXs complaint, contrary to the Eleventh Circuits apparent view, does protest Alabamas imposition of taxes on its fuel.  The exemptions the State has given may play a central role in CSXs argument, but the complaints essential subject remains the taxes imposed.


The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be said to discriminate against a railroad under subsection (b)(4) where the State has granted exemptions from the tax to other entities (here, the railroads competitors).  Because the statute does not define discriminates, the Court again looks to the terms ordinary meaning, which is to fail to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.  To charge one group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4% rate, if the groups are the same in all relevant respects, is to discriminate against the latter.  That discrimination continues if the favored groups rate goes down to 0%, which is all an exemption is.  To say that such a tax does not discriminate is to adopt a definition at odds with the words natural meaning.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that tax schemes with exemptions may be discriminatory.  See, e.g., Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803.  And even Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, on which the Eleventh Circuit heavily relied in dismissing CSXs suit, made clear that tax exemptions could be a variant of tax discrimination.  Id., at 343.  In addition, the statutes prohibition of discrimination applies regardless whether the favored entities are interstate or local.  The distinctions drawn in the statute are not between interstate and local actors, as Alabama suggests, but between railroads and all other actors, whether interstate or local.  Pp.510.


(b)ACF Industries does not require a different result.  There, the Court held that railroads could not contest property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4), reasoning that it would be illogical to permit such a challenge when subsections (b)(1)(3)the 11501 provisions specifically addressing property taxespermitted States to grant property tax exemptions.  Such a reading would subvert the statutory plan and contravene the elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.  510 U. S., at 340.  Contrary to Alabamas argument, this structural analysis does not apply here.  Subsections (b)(1)(3) specifically allow property tax exemptions, but neither they nor any other provision of the Act speaks to non-property exemptions like those at issue here.  Because Congress has expressed no intent to allo[w] the States to grant non-property exemptions, id., at 343, reading subsection (b)(4) to encompass them poses no danger of nullify[ing] a congressional policy choice or otherwise subverting the statutory plan, id., at 340, 343.  Alabamas other efforts to borrow from ACF Industries analysis similarly fail.  Also unavailing is Alabamas argument that, even if ACF Industries reasoning is limited to property tax exemptions, its holding must extend to non-property tax exemptions in order to prevent inconsistent or anomalous results in the treatment of property and non-property taxes.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 09152.Argued October 12, 2010Decided February 22, 2011
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) created a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing legitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult.  The Act provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a petition for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the claimant can then decide whether to accept the courts judgment or reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.  Awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.  As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability protections.  Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability for a vaccines unavoidable, adverse side effects.


Hannah Bruesewitzs parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled after receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent Wyeth).  After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, alleging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederles DTP vaccine caused Hannahs disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania common law.  Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court.  It granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Pennsylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S.C. 300aa22(b)(1), which provides that [n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.  The Third Circuit affirmed.
Held:The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccines side effects.  Pp.719.
(a)Section 300aa22(b)(1)s text suggests that a vaccines design is not open to question in a tort action.  If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design, the even though clause would do no work.  A vaccine side effect could always have been avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful element.  The language of the provision thus suggests the design is not subject to question in a tort action.  What the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with respect to the particular design.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law establishes three grounds for liabilitydefective manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and defective designthe Act mentions only manufacture and warnings.  It thus seems that the Acts failure to mention design-defect liability is by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.  Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.  Pp.78.


(b)Contrary to petitioners argument, there is no reason to believe that 300aa22(b)(1)s term unavoidable is a term of art incorporating Restatement (Second) of Torts 402A, Comment k, which exempts from strict liability rules unavoidably unsafe products.  Unavoidable is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k attach special significance only to the term unavoidably unsafe products, not the word unavoidable standing alone.  Moreover, reading the phrase side effects that were unavoidable to exempt injuries caused by flawed design would require treating even though as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause weakens or qualifies the other.  The canon against superfluity does not undermine this Courts interpretation because petitioners competing interpretation has superfluity problems of its own.  Pp.812.


(c)The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what 300aa22(b)(1)s text suggests.  Design defects do not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Administration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufacturing process.  This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically mentioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.  The Acts mandates lead to the same conclusion.  It provides for federal agency improvement of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation, which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of design-defect tortsprompting the development of improved designs, and providing compensation for inflicted injuries.  The Acts structural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion.  The vaccine manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.  Taxing their product to fund the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the market.  Pp.1316.

Moreover, reading the phrase side effects that were unavoidable to exempt injuries caused by flawed design would require treating even though as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause weakens or qualifies the other.  The canon against superfluity does not undermine this Courts interpretation because petitioners competing interpretation has superfluity problems of its own.  Pp.812.


(c)The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what 300aa22(b)(1)s text suggests.  Design defects do not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Administration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufacturing process.  This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically mentioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.  The Acts mandates lead to the same conclusion.  It provides for federal agency improvement of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation, which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of design-defect tortsprompting the development of improved designs, and providing compensation for inflicted injuries.  The Acts structural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion.  The vaccine manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.  Taxing their product to fund the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the market.  Pp.1316.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09329.Argued December 8, 2010Decided January 24, 2011
Regulation Zpromulgated by the Federal Reserve Board (Board) pursuant to its authority under the Truth in Lending Actrequires credit card issuers to disclose certain information to cardholders.  The version of the regulation in effect at the time this dispute arose obliges issuers to provide to cardholders an [i]nitial disclosure statement, 12 CFR 226.6, specifying each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge, 226.6(a)(2).  It also imposes [s]ubsequent disclosure requirements, 226.9, including notice to cardholders [w]henever any term required to be disclosed under 226.6 is changed, 226.9(c)(1).  When a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumers delinquency or default, notice must be given before the effective date of the change.  Ibid. 


At the time respondent McCoy filed suit, he was the holder of a credit card issued by petitioner Chase Bank.  The cardholder agreement provided, in relevant part, that McCoy was eligible for Preferred rates as long as he met certain conditions.  If any of those conditions were not met, Chase reserved the right to raise the rate, up to a pre-set maximum, and to apply the change to both existing and new balances.  McCoy alleges that Chase increased his interest rate due to his delinquency or default and applied that increase retroactively, and that this action violated Regulation Z because Chase did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect.  The District Court dismissed his complaint, holding that because the increase did not constitute a change in terms under 226.9(c), Chase was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that Regulation Z requires issuers to provide notice of an interest-rate increase prior to its effective date.  
Held:At the time of the transactions at issue, Regulation Z did not require Chase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice before implementing the agreement term allowing it to raise his interest rate, up to a pre-set maximum, following delinquency or default.  Pp.719.
(a)This case requires the Court to determine the meaning of a regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory authority.  However, Regulation Zs text is unclear with respect to the crucial interpretive question at issue: whether a change to an interest rate, pursuant to previously-disclosed contractual provision, constitutes a change to a term required to be disclosed under 226.6 requiring a subsequent disclosure under 226.9(c)(1).  Because of this ambiguity, the Court must look to the Boards own interpretation of the regulation for guidance in deciding this case.  Pp.712.


(b)The Board has made clear in its amicus brief to this Court that, in its view, Chase was not required to give McCoy notice of the interest rate increase under the applicable version of Regulation Z.  This Court defers to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation, advanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In Auer, the Court deferred to the Secretary of Labors interpretation of his own regulation, presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at the Courts invitation.  The Court held that the fact that the interpretation came in a legal brief did not, in the circumstances of th[at] case, make it unworthy of deference.  Id., at 462.  The interpretation was in no sense a post hoc rationalization advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack, ibid. (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted), and there was no reason to suspect that the interpretation [did] not reflect the agencys fair and considered judgment on the matter in question, ibid.  The brief submitted by the Board here, at the Courts invitation, is no different.  As in Auer, there is no reason to believe that the Boards interpretation is a post hoc rationalization taken as a litigation position, for the Board is not a party to this case.  And its interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the indeterminate text of Regulation Z.  Thus, there is no reason to suspect that the Boards position in its amicus brief reflects anything other than its fair and considered judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute arose.  That Congress and the Board may currently hold a different view does not mean that deference is not warranted to the Boards understanding of what the applicable version of Regulation Z required.  Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the interpretation in the agency amicus brief is warranted.  Pp.1216.


(c)McCoy errs in arguing that deference to a legal brief is inappropriate because the interpretation of Regulation Z in the Official Staff Commentary commands a different result.  While Commentary promulgated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z may warrant deference as a general matter, the Commentary explaining the requirements at issue in this case largely replicates the ambiguity present in the regulatory text, and therefore offers no reason to disregard the interpretation advanced in the Boards amicus brief.  Pp.1619.

09-737|"ORTIZ v. JORDAN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 09737.Argued November 1, 2010Decided January 24, 2011
Petitioner Ortiz, a former inmate in an Ohio reformatory, brought a civil rights action under 42 U. S.C. 1983 seeking a judgment for damages against superintending prison officers.  On two consecutive nights during her incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer.  Although she promptly reported the first assault, she further alleged, respondent Jordan, a case manager in her living unit, did nothing to ward off the second sexual assault, despite Jordans awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence.  Ortiz further charged that respondent Bright, a prison investigator, retaliated against Ortiz for her accusations by placing her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets.  The responses of both officers, she said, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from violence while in custody.


Jordan and Bright moved for summary judgment on pleas of qualified immunity.  The District Court, noting factual disputes material to Ortizs claims and the officers qualified immunity defenses, denied the summary judgment motion.  The officers did not appeal that ruling.  The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict against Jordan and Bright.  They sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), both at the close of Ortizs evidence and at the close of their own presentation.  But they did not contest the jurys liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b), their request for judgment as a matter of law.  Nor did they request a new trial under Rule 59(a).  The District Court entered judgment for Ortiz.  On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged, inter alia, that the District Court should have granted their motion for summary judgment based on their qualified immunity defense.  The Sixth Circuit agreed and reversed the judgment entered on the jurys verdict, holding that both defendants were sheltered from Ortizs suit by qualified immunity.
Held:A party may not appeal a denial of summary judgment after a district court has conducted a full trial on the merits.  A qualified immunity plea, not upheld at the summary judgment stage, may be pursued at trial, but at that stage, the plea must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.  Ordinarily, orders denying summary judgment are interlocutory and do not qualify as final decisions subject to appeal under 28 U. S.C. 1291.  Because a qualified immunity plea can spare an official not only from liability but from trial, this Court has recognized a limited exception to the categorization of summary judgment denials as nonappealable orders.  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525526.  The exception permits an immediate appeal when summary judgment is denied to a defendant who urges that qualified immunity shelters her from suit.  Id., at 527.  Such an immediate appeal is not available, however, when the district court determines that factual issues genuinely in dispute preclude summary adjudication.  Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 313.  Here, Jordan and Bright sought no immediate appeal from the denial of their summary judgment motion.  Nor did they avail themselves of Rule 50(b), which permits the entry of judgment, postverdict, for the verdict loser if the court finds the evidence legally insufficient to sustain the verdict.  Absent such a motion, an appellate court is powerless to review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial.  Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. 394, 405.  This Court need not address the officers argument that a qualified immunity plea raising a purely legal issue is preserved for appeal by an unsuccessful summary judgment motion even if the plea is not reiterated in a Rule 50(b) motion.  Cases fitting that bill typically involve disputes about the substance and clarity of pre-existing law.  In this case, however, what was controverted was not the pre-existing law, but the facts that could render Jordan and Bright answerable under 1983, e.g., whether Jordan was adequately informed, after the first assault, of the assailants identity and of Ortizs fear of a further assault.  Because the dispositive facts were disputed, the officers qualified immunity defenses did not present neat abstract issues of law.  Johnson, 515 U. S., at 317.  To the extent that Jordan and Bright urge Ortiz has not proved her case, they were, by their own account, obliged to raise that sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue by postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b).  They did not do so.  The Sixth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to upset the jurys decision on their liability.  Pp.611.

10-333|"GARY SWARTHOUT, WARDEN v. DAMON COOKE


MATTHEW CATE, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION v. ELIJAH CLAY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 10333.Decided January 24, 2011
Per Curiam.
I

Californias parole statute provides that the Board of Prison Terms shall set a release date unless it determines that  consideration of the public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. 3041(b) (West Supp. 2010).  If the Board denies parole, the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas petition.  The California Supreme Court has explained that the standard of review properly is characterized as whether some evidence supports the conclusion that the inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently is dangerous.  Inre Lawrence, 44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190 P.3d 535, 539 (2008).  See also Inre Shaputis, 44 Cal. 4th 1241, 12531254, 190 P.3d 573, 580 (2008); Inre Rosenkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 625626, 59 P.3d 174, 183 (2002).
A

Respondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted first-degree murder in 1991, and a California court sentenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life in prison with the possibility of parole.  In November 2002, the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for parole, basing its decision on the especially cruel and callous manner of his commitment offense, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilitative programs; his failure to develop marketable skills; and three incidents of misconduct while in prison.  The board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psychological report, but it dismissed the report as not credible because it included several inconsistent and erroneous statements.
Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court.  The court denied his petition.  The record indicates, it said, that there was some evidence, including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to support the boards denial.  Id., at 42a.  Cooke subsequently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California Supreme Court.  Both were denied.


In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U. S.C. 2254 challenging the parole boards determination.  The District Court denied his petition.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Californias parole statute created a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, and that Californias some evidence requirement was a component of that federally protected liberty interest.  Cooke v. Solis, 606 F.3d 1206, 1213 (2010).  It then concluded that the state court had made an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence under 2254(d)(2) by finding any evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public safety if released.  Id., at 1215.
B

Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree murder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of parole.  In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole, but the Governor exercised his authority to review the case and found Clay unsuitable for parole.  See Cal. Const., Art. 5, 8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. 3041.2 (West 2000).  The Governor cited the gravity of Clays crime;
his extensive criminal history, which reflected the culmination of a life of crime, App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;
his failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being paroled.  Regarding the last factor, the Governor concluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given his propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable means of employment.
Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court.  That court denied Clays petition, as did the California Court of Appeal.  The California Supreme Court denied review.


Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court granted.  The District Court concluded that the Governors reliance on the nature of Clays long-past commitment offense vio-lated Clays right to due process, and dismissed each of
the other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the record.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Courts conclusion that the Governors decision was an unreasonable application of Californias some evidence rule and was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.  Clay v. Kane, 384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).
II

In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that the state courts had misapplied Californias some evidence rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the States some evidence standard is required by the federal Due Process Clause.  Neither assumption is correct.
As to the first: The habeas statute unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.  Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S.C. 2254(a)).  We have stated many times that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).


As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the
procedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient.  Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U. S. 454, 460 (1989).  Here, the Ninth Circuit held that California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606 F.3d, at 1213.  While we have no need to review that holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.  See Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 373381 (1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979).


Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state interest created by California law.  There is no right under the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners.  Id., at 7.  When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindicationand federal courts will review the application of those constitutionally required procedures.  In the context of parole, we have held that the procedures required are minimal.  In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject to a parole statute similar to Californias received adequate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why parole was denied.  442 U. S., at 16.  The Constitution, we held, does not require more.  Ibid.  Cooke and Clay received at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied.  606 F.3d, at 12081212; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. 3041, 3041.5 (West Supp. 2010).


That should have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts inquiry into whether Cooke and Clay received due process.  Instead, however, the Court of Appeals reviewed the state courts decisions on the merits and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the facts in light of the evidence.  See 606 F.3d, at 12131216; 384 Fed. Appx., at 545546.  Other Ninth Circuit cases have done the same.  See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F.3d 606, 611 (2010).  No opinion of ours supports converting Californias some evidence rule into a substantive federal requirement.  The liberty interest at issue here is the interest in receiving parole when the California standards for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures adequate for due-process protection of that interest are those set forth in Greenholtz.*  See Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F.3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc).  Greenholtz did not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that the evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern here whether Californias some evidence rule of judicial review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution demands) was correctly applied.


It will not do to pronounce Californias some evidence rule to be a component of the liberty interest, 606 F.3d, at 1213.  Such reasoning would subject to federal-court merits review the application of all state-prescribed procedures in cases involving liberty or property interests, including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions.  That has never been the law.  To the contrary, we have long recognized that a mere error of state law is not a denial of due process.  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n.21 (1982); see also Estelle, 502 U. S., at 6768.  Because the only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly.


The Ninth Circuits questionable finding that there was no evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as 2254(a) requires.  See id., at 67.  The short of the matter is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing Californias parole system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth Circuits business.


The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.


The judgments below are
Reversed.
*Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the revocation of good-time credits should apply, citing Inre Rosenkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 657658, 59 P.3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Supreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S. 445 (1985).  But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Californias parole system with good-time credits.  It cites Hill twice.  The first citation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier opinion adopting the some evidence test for decisions to revoke parole that had previously been granted.  29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P.3d, at 204.  The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discussing the need for some evidence review in parole decisions, simply borrows language from Hill to support the proposition that [r]equiring a modicum of evidence can help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.  29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P.3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U. S., at 455).  In any event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one of federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes close to addressing that question.  Any doubt on that score is resolved by a subsequent footnote stating that the courts decision is premised only on state law.  29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n.12, 59 P.3d, at 205, n.12.

09-291|"THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 09291.Argued December 7, 2010Decided January 24, 2011
After petitioner Thompsons fiance, Miriam Regalado, filed a sex discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against their employer, respondent North American Stainless (NAS), NAS fired Thompson.  He filed his own charge and a subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.  The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination against an employee because he has made a [Title VII] charge, 42 U. S.C. 2000e3(a), and which permits, inter alia, a person claiming to be aggrieved  by [an] alleged employment practice to file a civil action, 2000e5(f)(1).  The en banc Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Thompson was not entitled to sue NAS for retaliation because he had not engaged in any activity protected by the statute.
Held:
1.If the facts Thompson alleges are true, his firing by NAS constituted unlawful retaliation.  Title VIIs antiretaliation provision must be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct.  Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53.  It prohibits any employer action that well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a [discrimination] charge, id., at 68.  That test must be applied in an objective fashion, to avoi[d] the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiffs unusual subjective feelings.  Id., at 6869.  A reasonable worker obviously might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc would be fired.  Pp. 24.  


2.Title VII grants Thompson a cause of action.  Pp.47.


(a)For Title VII standing purposes, the term person aggrieved must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.  Dictum in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205, suggesting that Title VIIs aggrievement requirement reaches as far as Article III permits, is too expansive and the Court declines to follow it.  At the other extreme, limiting person aggrieved to the person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially narrow reading.  A common usage of the term person aggrieved avoids both of these extremes.  The Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any person  adversely affected or aggrieved  within the meaning of a relevant statute, 5 U. S.C. 702, establishes a regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint, Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883.  Title VIIs term aggrieved incorporates that test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to be protected by the statutes, National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495, while excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III sense but whose interests are unrelated to Title VIIs statutory prohibitions.  Pp.47.


(b)Applying that test here, Thompson falls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII.  He was an employee of NAS, and Title VIIs purpose is to protect employees from their employers unlawful actions.  Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation.  Hurting him was the unlawful act by which NAS punished Regalado.  Thus, Thompson is a person aggrieved with standing to sue under Title VII.  P.7.
567 F.3d 804, reversed and remanded.

09-587|"HARRINGTON, WARDEN v. RICHTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09587.Argued October 12, 2010Decided January 19, 2011
In 1994, deputies called to drug dealer Johnsons California home found Johnson wounded and Klein fatally wounded.  Johnson claimed that he was shot in his bedroom by respondent Richters codefendant, Branscombe; that he found Klein on the living room couch; and that his gun safe, a pistol, and cash were missing.  His account was corroborated by evidence at the scene, including, relevant here, spent shell casings, blood spatters, and blood pooled in the bedroom doorway.  Investigators took a blood sample from a wall near the bedroom door, but not from the blood pool.  A search of Richters home turned up the safe and ammunition matching evidence at the scene.  After his arrest on murder and other charges, Richter initially denied his involvement, but later admitted disposing of Johnsons and Branscombes guns.  The prosecution initially built its case on Johnsons testimony and the circumstantial evidence, but it adjusted its approach after Richters counsel, in his opening statement, outlined the theory that Branscombe shot Johnson in self-defense and that Klein was killed in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway, and stressed the lack of forensic support for the prosecutions case.  The prosecution then decided to call an expert in blood pattern evidence, who testified that it was unlikely that Klein had been shot outside the living room and then moved to the couch, and a serologist, who testified that the blood sample taken near the blood pool could be Johnsons but not Kleins.  Under cross-examination, she conceded that she had not tested the sample for cross-contamination and that a degraded sample would make it difficult to tell if it had blood of Kleins type.  Defense counsel called Richter to tell his conflicting version of events and called other witnesses to corroborate Richters version.  Richter was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.  He later sought habeas relief from the California Supreme Court, asserting, inter alia, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, when he failed to present expert testimony on blood evidence, because it could have disclosed the blood pools source and bolstered Richters theory.  He also offered affidavits from forensics experts to support his claim.  The court denied the petition in a one-sentence summary order.  Subsequently, he reasserted his state claims in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court denied his petition.  A Ninth Circuit panel affirmed, but the en banc court reversed.  Initially it questioned whether 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)which, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), limits the availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously adjudicated on the merits in state courtapplied to Richters petition, since the State Supreme Court issued only a summary denial.  But it found the state-court decision unreasonable anyway.  In its view, trial counsel was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in planning a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prosecution mightand later didoffer.  
Held: 
1.Section 2254(d) applies to Richters petition, even though the state courts order was unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the courts reasoning.  Pp.710.


(a)By its terms, 2254(d) bars relitigation of a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless, among other exceptions, the earlier state-court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by this Court, 2254(d)(1).  Nothing in its textwhich refers only to a decision resulting from an adjudicationrequires a statement of reasons.  Where the state-court decision has no explanation, the habeas petitioner must still show there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.  There is no merit to the assertion that applying 2254(d) when state courts issue summary rulings will encourage those courts to withhold explanations.  The issuance of summary dispositions can enable state judiciaries to concentrate resources where most needed.  Pp.79.


(b)Nor is there merit to Richters argument that 2254(d) does not apply because the California Supreme Court did not say it was adjudicating his claim on the merits.  When a state court has denied relief, adjudication on the merits can be presumed absent any contrary indication or state-law procedural principles.  The presumption may be overcome by a more likely explanation for the state courts decision, but Richter does not make that showing here.  Pp.910.


2.Richter was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth Circuit.  Pp.1024.


(a)That court failed to accord the required deference to the decision of a state court adjudicating the same claims later presented in the federal habeas petition.  Its opinion shows an improper understanding of 2254(d)s unreasonableness standard and operation in the context of a Strickland claim.  Asking whether the state courts application of Stricklands standard was unreasonable is different from asking whether defense counsels performance fell below that standard.  Under AEDPA, a state court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation in a case involving direct review under Strickland.  A state courts determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fair-minded jurists could disagree on the correctness of that decision.  Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664.  And the more general the rule being considered, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.  Ibid.  The Ninth Circuit explicitly conducted a de novo review and found a Strickland violation; it then declared without further explanation that the state courts contrary decision was unreasonable.  But 2254(d) requires a habeas court to determine what arguments or theories supported, or could have supported, the state-court decision; and then to ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with a prior decision of this Court.  AEDPAs unreasonableness standard is not a test of the confidence of a federal habeas court in the conclusion it would reach as a de novo matter.  Even a strong case for relief does not make the state courts contrary conclusion unreasonable.  Section 2254(d) is designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions.  Pp.1014. 


(b)The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that Richter demonstrated an unreasonable application of Strickland by the state court.  Pp.1423.


(1)Richter could have secured relief in state court only by showing both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that prejudice resulted.  To be deficient, counsels representation must have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness, Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688; and there is a strong presumption that counsels representation is within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, id., at 689.  The question is whether counsel made errors so fundamental that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  Prejudice requires demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Id., at 694.  Surmounting Stricklands high bar is never  easy.  Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S.___, ___.  Strickland can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture.  The question is whether an attorneys representation amounted to incompetence under prevailing professional norms, not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.  Establishing that a state courts application of Strickland was unreasonable under 2254(d) is even more difficult, since both standards are highly deferential, 466 U. S. at 689, and since Stricklands general standard has a substantial range of reasonable applications.  The question under 2254(d) is not whether counsels actions were reasonable, but whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Stricklands deferential standard.  Pp.1416.


(2)The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that because Richters attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert evidence, the State Supreme Court could not reasonably have concluded counsel provided adequate representation.  


A state court could reasonably conclude that a competent attorney could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence experts.  Rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys will be limited to any one technique or approach.  There were any number of experts whose insight might have been useful to the defense.  Counsel is entitled to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics and strategies.  In finding otherwise the Ninth Circuit failed to reconstruct the circumstances of counsels challenged conduct and evaluate the conduct from counsels perspective at the time.  Strickland, supra, at 689.  Given the many factual differences between the prosecution and defense versions of events, it was far from evident at the time of trial that the blood source was central to Richters case.  And relying on the harsh light of hindsight to cast doubt on a trial that took place over 15 years ago is precisely what Strickland and AEDPA seek to prevent.  See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702.  Even had the value of expert testimony been apparent, it would be reasonable to conclude that a competent attorney might elect not to use it here, where counsel had reason to question the truth of his clients account.  Making blood evidence a central issue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert analysis, possibly destroying Richters case, or distracted the jury with esoteric questions of forensic science.  Defense counsels opening statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evidence, but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out as well as hoped.  In light of the record here there was no basis to rule that the state courts determination was unreasonable.  


The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inaccurate account of counsels actual thinking, since Strickland examined only the objective reasonableness of counsels actions.  As to whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing expert testimony as a response to the prosecutions, an attorney may not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to prepare for remote possibilities.  Here, even if counsel was mistaken, the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic testimony until the eve of trial.  Thus, it is at least debatable whether counsels error was so fundamental as to call the trials fairness into doubt.  Even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecutions tactic, Richter would still need to show it was indisputable that Strickland required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on cross-examination to discredit the witnesses, but Strickland imposes no such requirement.  And while it is possible an isolated error can constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious, it is difficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsels overall performance reflects active and capable advocacy.  Pp.1622.


(3)The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that Richter had established prejudice under Strickland, which asks whether it is reasonably likely the verdict would have been different, 466 U. S., at 696, not whether a court can be certain counsels performance had no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been established had counsel acted differently.  There must be a substantial likelihood of a different result.   The State Supreme Court could have reasonably concluded that Richters prejudice evidence fell short of this standard.  His expert serology evidence established only a theoretical possibility of Kleins blood being in the blood pool; and at trial, defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prosecutions expert.  It was also reasonable to find Richter had not established prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other conclusions of the prosecutions experts, e.g., that the blood sample matched Johnsons blood type.  There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to Richters guilt, including, e.g., the items found at his home.  Pp. 2223. 
578 F.3d 944, reversed and remanded.

Making blood evidence a central issue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert analysis, possibly destroying Richters case, or distracted the jury with esoteric questions of forensic science.  Defense counsels opening statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evidence, but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out as well as hoped.  In light of the record here there was no basis to rule that the state courts determination was unreasonable.  


The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inaccurate account of counsels actual thinking, since Strickland examined only the objective reasonableness of counsels actions.  As to whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing expert testimony as a response to the prosecutions, an attorney may not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to prepare for remote possibilities.  Here, even if counsel was mistaken, the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic testimony until the eve of trial.  Thus, it is at least debatable whether counsels error was so fundamental as to call the trials fairness into doubt.  Even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecutions tactic, Richter would still need to show it was indisputable that Strickland required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on cross-examination to discredit the witnesses, but Strickland imposes no such requirement.  And while it is possible an isolated error can constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious, it is difficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsels overall performance reflects active and capable advocacy.  Pp.1622.


(3)The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that Richter had established prejudice under Strickland, which asks whether it is reasonably likely the verdict would have been different, 466 U. S., at 696, not whether a court can be certain counsels performance had no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been established had counsel acted differently.  There must be a substantial likelihood of a different result.   The State Supreme Court could have reasonably concluded that Richters prejudice evidence fell short of this standard.  His expert serology evidence established only a theoretical possibility of Kleins blood being in the blood pool; and at trial, defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prosecutions expert.  It was also reasonable to find Richter had not established prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other conclusions of the prosecutions experts, e.g., that the blood sample matched Johnsons blood type.  There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to Richters guilt, including, e.g., the items found at his home.  Pp. 2223.

PENITENTIARY v. MOORE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09658.Argued October 12, 2010Decided January 19, 2011
Respondent Moore and two accomplices attacked and bloodied Kenneth Rogers, tied him up, and threw him in the trunk of a car before driving into the Oregon countryside, where Moore fatally shot him.  Afterwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moores brother and the accomplices girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that Moore had accidentally shot him.  Moore and the accomplice repeated this account to the police.  On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sentence for that offense.  He later sought postconviction relief in state court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.  He complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his confession to police in advance of the lawyers advice that Moore considered before accepting the plea offer.  The court concluded the suppression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moores other admissible confession to two witnesses.  Counsel gave that as his reason for not making the motion.  He added that he had advised Moore that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore could be charged with aggravated murder.  That crime was punishable by death or life in prison without parole.  These facts led the state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.  Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective-assistance claim.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state courts conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of Strickland and was contrary to Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279. 
Held:Moore was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth Circuit.  Pp.417.
(a)Under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d), federal habeas relief may not be granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state-court decision denying relief involves an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by this Court.  The relevant federal law is the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland, which requires a showing of both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice.  Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.46.


(b)The state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of either part of the Strickland rule.  Pp.616.


(1)The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept as a justification for counsels action that suppression would have been futile in light of Moores other admissible confession to two witnesses.  This explanation confirms that counsels representation was adequate under Strickland, so it is unnecessary to consider the reasonableness of his other justificationthat a suppression motion would have failed.  Plea bargains involve complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty, and defense counsel must make strategic choices in balancing opportunitiespleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a lesser sentenceand risksthat the plea bargain might come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not stronger.  Failure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can create at least two problems.  First, the potential for distortions and imbalance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too real; and habeas courts must be mindful of their limited role, to assess deficiency in light of information then available to counsel.  Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may      bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect because prosecutors must have assurances that a plea will not be undone in court years later.  In applying and defining the Strickland standardreasonable competence in representing the accusedsubstantial deference must be accorded to counsels judgment.  The absence of a developed and extensive record and well-defined prosecution or defense case creates a particular risk at the early plea stage.  Here, Moores prospects at trial were anything but certain.  Counsel knew that the two witnesses presented a serious strategic concern and that delaying the plea for further proceedings might allow the State to uncover additional incriminating evidence in support of a capital prosecution.  Under these circumstances, counsel made a reasonable choice.  At the very least, the state court would not have been unreasonable to so conclude.  The Court of Appeals relied further on Fulminante, but a state-court adjudication of counsels performance under the Sixth Amendment cannot be contrary to Fulminante, for Fulminantewhich involved the admission of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendmentsays nothing about Stricklands effectiveness standard.  Pp.612.


(2)The state court also reasonably could have concluded that Moore was not prejudiced by counsels actions.  To prevail in state court, he had to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsels errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59.  Deference to the state courts prejudice determination is significant, given the uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations.  That court reasonably could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.  The States case was already formidable with two witnesses to an admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the investigation continued.  Moore also faced the possibility of grave punishments.  Counsels bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the confession may have been essential to securing that agreement.  Again, the state courts finding could not be contrary to Fulminante, which does not speak to Stricklands prejudice standard or contemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.  To the extent Fulminantes harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that the state courts prejudice determination was reasonable.  Pp.1216.

09-907|"RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N.A., fka MBNA AMERICA BANK, N.A.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09907.Argued October 4, 2010Decided January 11, 2011
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as the means test to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.  The means test instructs a debtor to determine his disposable incomethe amount he has available to reimburse creditorsby deducting from his current monthly income amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for, inter alia, maintenance or support.  11 U. S.C. 1325(b)(2)(A)(i).  For a debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which expenses qualify as amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.  As relevant here, the statute provides that [t]he debtors monthly expenses shall be the debtors applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtors actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.  707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).


The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers ability to pay overdue taxes.  The IRS also creates supplemental guidelines known as the Collection Financial Standards, which describe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them mean.  The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation expenses, divided into vehicle Ownership Costs and vehicle Operating Costs.  The Collection Financial Standards explain that Ownership Costs cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automobile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car financing data.  The Collection Financial Standards further state that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance for ownership costs.


When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor.  Among his assets, Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt.  In determining his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduction of $471, the full amount specified in the Ownership Costs table, as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs.  Based on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt.  FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct all of Ransoms disposable income to unsecured creditors.  FIA contended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership allowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.  Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.  The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the car-ownership deduction.  Pp.618.
(a)This Courts interpretation begins with the language of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only applicable expense amounts listed in the Standards.  Because the Code does not define the key word applicable, the term carries its ordinary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.  What makes an expense amount applicable in this sense is most naturally understood to be its correspondence to an individual debtors financial circumstances.  Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if that deduction is appropriate for him.  And a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the table during the life of the plan.  Had Congress not wanted to separate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it could have omitted the term applicable altogether.  Without that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the Standards.  Interpreting the statute to require a threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that applicable carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.


This reading draws support from the statutes context and purpose.  The Code initially defines a debtors disposable income as his current monthly income  less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.  1325(b)(2).  It then instructs that such reasonably necessary amounts shall be determined in accordance with the means test.  1325(b)(3).  Because Congress intended the means test to approximate the debtors reasonable expenditures on essential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category.  Further, the statutes purposeto ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can affordis best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with the statutory text, to reflect a debtors ability to afford repayment.  Pp.69.


(b)The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car loan or lease.  The expense amount listed ($471) is the average monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a car.  Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate Operating Costs deduction.  A person who owns a car free and clear is entitled to the Operating Costs deduction for all driving-related expenses.  But such a person may not claim the Ownership Costs deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car loan or lease.  The IRS Collection Financial Standards reinforce this conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduction.  Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no expense in the Ownership Costs category, and that expense amount is therefore not applicable to him.  Pp.911.


(c)Ransoms arguments to the contraryan alternative interpretation of the key word applicable, an objection to the Courts view of the scope of the Ownership Costs category, and a criticism of the policy implications of the Courts approachare unpersuasive.  Pp.1118.

09-530|"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION etal. v. NELSON etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09530.Argued October 5, 2010Decided January 19, 2011
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract employees.  Respondents are contract employees at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech).  Respondents were not subject to Government background checks at the time they were hired, but that changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identification standards for both federal civil servants and contractor employees.  The Department of Commerce mandated that contract employees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI), by October 2007.  NASA modified its contract with Cal Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that employees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be denied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.


The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form 85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF85)).  SF85 asks whether an employee has used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs in the last year.  If so, the employee must provide details, including information about treatment or counseling received.  The employee must also sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers, and others during its investigation.  Once SF85 is completed, the Government sends the employees references a questionnaire (Form 42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have any reason to question the employees honesty or trustworthiness, or have adverse information concerning a variety of other matters.  All SF85 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the Privacy Act.


With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near, respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check process violates a constitutional right to informational privacy.  The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that SF85s inquiries into recent drug involvement furthered the Governments interest in combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug treatment or counseling question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held unconstitutional.  It also held that Form 42s open-ended questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Governments interests in verifying contractors identities and ensuring JPLs security, and thus also likely violated respondents informational-privacy rights.
Held: 
1.In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred broadly to a constitutional privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600; Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457.  In Whalen, the Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the statutes security provisions, which protected against public disclosure of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600601, were sufficient to protect a privacy interest arguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution, id., at 605.  In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at issue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against undue dissemination of private materials.  433 U. S. at 458.  Since Nixon, the Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to informational privacy.  Pp.810.


2.Assuming, without deciding, that the Governments challenged inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance, that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF85 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject to the Privacy Acts safeguards against public disclosure.  Pp.1024.


(a)The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake.  Pp.1119.


(1)Judicial review of the forms must take into account the context in which the Governments challenged inquiries arise.  When the Government acts in its capacity as proprietor and manager of its internal operation, Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to citizens generally.  The questions respondents challenge are part of a standard background check of the sort used by millions of private employers.  The Government has been conducting employment investigations since the Republics earliest days, and the President has had statutory authority to assess an applicants fitness for the civil service since 1871.  Standard background investigations similar to those at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates in 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees.  This history shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic background checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and to employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the peoples business.  The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents are contract employees.  There are no meaningful distinctions in the duties of NASAs civil-service and contractor employees, especially at JPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASAs mission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer investment.  Pp.1215. 


(2)The challenged questions on SF85 and Form 42 are reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Governments interests in managing its internal operations.  SF85s treatment or counseling question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry about illegal-drug use.  In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue, seeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.  Thus, it uses responses to the drug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor credentialing decisions.  The Court rejects the argument that the Government has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its employment background questions are necessary or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests.  So exacting a standard runs directly contrary to Whalen.  See 429 U. S., at 596597.  Pp.1618.


(3)Like SF85s drug-treatment question, Form 42s open-ended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Governments business.  Asking an applicants designated references broad questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones.  The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private sectors.  Pp.1819.


(b)In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake, SF85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial protections against disclosure to the public.  Whalen and Nixon recognized that a statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures generally allays privacy concerns created by government accumulation of personal information for public purposes.  Whalen, supra, at 605.  Respondents attack only the Governments collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the information collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclosure.  The Privacy Actwhich allows the Government to maintain only those records relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose authorized by law, 5 U. S.C. 552a(e)(1); requires written consent before the Government may disclose an individuals records, 552a(b); and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure obligations, 552a(i)(1)evidence[s] a proper concern for individual privacy.  Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458459.  Respondents claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Acts disclosure bar, see 552a(b)(1)(12), leave its protections too porous to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures.  But that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and the Privacy Act.  Pp.1923.

			"|"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION etal. v. NELSON etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 09530.Argued October 5, 2010Decided January 19, 2011
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract employees.  Respondents are contract employees at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech).  Respondents were not subject to Government background checks at the time they were hired, but that changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identification standards for both federal civil servants and contractor employees.  The Department of Commerce mandated that contract employees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI), by October 2007.  NASA modified its contract with Cal Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that employees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be denied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.


The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form 85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF85)).  SF85 asks whether an employee has used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs in the last year.  If so, the employee must provide details, including information about treatment or counseling received.  The employee must also sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers, and others during its investigation.  Once SF85 is completed, the Government sends the employees references a questionnaire (Form 42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have any reason to question the employees honesty or trustworthiness, or have adverse information concerning a variety of other matters.  All SF85 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the Privacy Act.


With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near, respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check process violates a constitutional right to informational privacy.  The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that SF85s inquiries into recent drug involvement furthered the Governments interest in combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug treatment or counseling question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held unconstitutional.  It also held that Form 42s open-ended questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Governments interests in verifying contractors identities and ensuring JPLs security, and thus also likely violated respondents informational-privacy rights.
Held: 
1.In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred broadly to a constitutional privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600; Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457.  In Whalen, the Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the statutes security provisions, which protected against public disclosure of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600601, were sufficient to protect a privacy interest arguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution, id., at 605.  In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at issue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against undue dissemination of private materials.  433 U. S. at 458.  Since Nixon, the Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to informational privacy.  Pp.810.


2.Assuming, without deciding, that the Governments challenged inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance, that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF85 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject to the Privacy Acts safeguards against public disclosure.  Pp.1024.


(a)The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake.  Pp.1119.


(1)Judicial review of the forms must take into account the context in which the Governments challenged inquiries arise.  When the Government acts in its capacity as proprietor and manager of its internal operation, Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to citizens generally.  The questions respondents challenge are part of a standard background check of the sort used by millions of private employers.  The Government has been conducting employment investigations since the Republics earliest days, and the President has had statutory authority to assess an applicants fitness for the civil service since 1871.  Standard background investigations similar to those at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates in 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees.  This history shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic background checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and to employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the peoples business.  The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents are contract employees.  There are no meaningful distinctions in the duties of NASAs civil-service and contractor employees, especially at JPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASAs mission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer investment.  Pp.1215. 


(2)The challenged questions on SF85 and Form 42 are reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Governments interests in managing its internal operations.  SF85s treatment or counseling question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry about illegal-drug use.  In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue, seeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.  Thus, it uses responses to the drug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor credentialing decisions.  The Court rejects the argument that the Government has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its employment background questions are necessary or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests.  So exacting a standard runs directly contrary to Whalen.  See 429 U. S., at 596597.  Pp.1618.


(3)Like SF85s drug-treatment question, Form 42s open-ended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Governments business.  Asking an applicants designated references broad questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones.  The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private sectors.  Pp.1819.


(b)In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake, SF85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial protections against disclosure to the public.  Whalen and Nixon recognized that a statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures generally allays privacy concerns created by government accumulation of personal information for public purposes.  Whalen, supra, at 605.  Respondents attack only the Governments collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the information collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclosure.  The Privacy Actwhich allows the Government to maintain only those records relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose authorized by law, 5 U. S.C. 552a(e)(1); requires written consent before the Government may disclose an individuals records, 552a(b); and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure obligations, 552a(i)(1)evidence[s] a proper concern for individual privacy.  Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458459.  Respondents claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Acts disclosure bar, see 552a(b)(1)(12), leave its protections too porous to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures.  But that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and the Privacy Act.  Pp.1923.

10-72|"MADISON COUNTY, NEW YORK et al. v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF NEW YORK
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 1072.Decided January 10, 2011
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari, 562 U. S.___(2010), on the questions whether tribal sovereign immunity from suit, to the extent it should continue to be recognized, bars taxing authorities from foreclosing to collect lawfully imposed property taxes and whether the ancient Oneida reservation in New York was disestablished or diminished.  Pet. for Cert. i.  Counsel for respondent Oneida Indian Nation advised the Court through a letter on November 30, 2010, that the Nation had, on November 29, 2010, passed a tribal declaration and ordinance waiving its sovereign immunity to enforcement of real property taxation through foreclosure by state, county and local governments within and throughout the United States.  Oneida Indian Nation, Ordinance No. O&nbhyph;101 (2010).  Petitioners Madison and Oneida Counties responded in a December 1, 2010 letter, questioning the validity, scope, and permanence of that waiver; the Nation addressed those concerns in a December 2, 2010 letter.


We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  That court should address, in the first instance, whether to revisit its ruling on sovereign immunity in light of this new factual development, andif necessaryproceed to address other questions in the case consistent with its sovereign immunity ruling.  See Kiyemba v. Obama, 559 U. S. ___ (2010) (per curiam).


Petitioners are awarded costs in this Court pursuant to this Courts Rule 43.2.
It is so ordered.
Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
