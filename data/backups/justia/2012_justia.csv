				KLOECKNER v. SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
			

				No. 11184.Argued October 2, 2012Decided December 10, 2012
			

				The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) permits a federal employee subjected to a particularly serious personnel action such as a discharge or demotion to appeal her agencys decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board).  Such an appeal may allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the CSRA itself; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by a federal statute.  See 

5 U.S.C. 7702(a)(1).  When an employee alleges that a personnel action appealable to the MSPB was based on discrimination, her case is known as a mixed case.  See 29 CFR 1614.302.  Mixed cases are governed by special procedures set out in the CSRA and regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
			

				
				
				
				
				Under those procedures, an employee may initiate a mixed case by filing a discrimination complaint with the agency.  If the agency decides against the employee, she may either appeal the agencys decision to the MSPB or sue the agency in district court.  Alternatively, the employee can bypass the agency and bring her mixed case directly to the MSPB.  If the MSPB upholds the personnel action, whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so, the employee is entitled to seek judicial review.
			

				
				
				
				
				Section 7703(b)(1) of the CSRA provides that petitions for review of MSPB decisions shall be filed in the ... Federal Circuit, except as provided in 7703(b)(2).  Section 7703(b)(2) instructs that [c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [7702] shall be filed under [the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute].  Those enforcement provisions all authorize suit in federal district court.  The cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of 7702 are those in which an employee (A) has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB], and (B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by a listed federal statute; in other words, mixed cases.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2005, while an employee of the Department of Labor (DOL or agency), petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner filed a complaint with the agencys civil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in unlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work environment.  Following applicable EEOC regulations, DOL completed an internal investigation and report, and Kloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge.  While the EEOC case was pending, Kloeckner was fired.  Because Kloeckner believed that DOLs decision to fire her was based on unlawful discrimination, she now had a mixed case.  Kloeckner originally brought her mixed case directly to the MSPB.  Concerned about duplicative discovery expenses between her EEOC and MSPB cases, she moved to amend her EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward.  Both motions were granted.  In September 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal without prejudice to her right to refile by January 18, 2007.  The EEOC case, however, continued until April 2007, when the EEOC judge terminated the proceeding as a sanction for Kloeckners bad-faith discovery conduct and returned the case to DOL for a final decision.  In October, DOL ruled against Kloeckner on all of her claims.  Kloeckner appealed to the Board in November 2007.  The Board dismissed Kloeckners appeal as untimely, viewing it as an effort to reopen her old MSPB case months after the January 18 deadline.
			

				
				
				
				
				Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination.  The court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  It held that, because the MSPB dismissed Kloeckners claims on procedural grounds, she should have sought review in the Federal Circuit under 7703(b)(1); in the courts view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to 7703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in 7702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not the Federal Circuit, regardless whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural grounds or on the merits.  Pp.714.
			

				
				
				(a)Two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeckner to district court.  Begin with  7703, which governs judicial review of MSPB rulings.  Section 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Boards final decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  Section 7703(b)(2) then provides that [c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [7702] shall be filed under the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute.  Each of the referenced enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.  Thus, [c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [7702] shall be filed in district court.  Turn next to 7702, which provides that the cases subject to [its] provisions are cases in which a federal employee has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB], and alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by a listed federal statute.  The cases of discrimination subject to 7702 are therefore mixed cases.  Putting 7703 and 7702 together, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.  That is where Kloeckners case should have been, and indeed was, filed.  Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or threw it out as untimely, she brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes to district court.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				(b)The Governments alternative viewthat the CSRA directs the MSPBs merits decisions to district court, while channeling its procedural rulings to the Federal Circuitis not supported by the statute.  According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not specifically prescribed in the CSRA, lies hidden in the statutes timing requirements.  But the Government cannot explain why Congress would have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.  And taking the Governments analysis one step at a time makes it no more plausible.  Pp.813.
			

				639 F.3d 834, reversed and remanded.

			The Civil Service Reform Act permits federal employees, subjected to serious personnel actions, to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, 5 U. S. C. 7701. Mixed cases, based on discrimination, are governed by the CSRA and MSPB and EEOC regulations. An employee may initiate a mixed case with the agency-employer or  directly with the MSPB. The CSRA provides that review of MSPB decisions shall be filed in the ... Federal Circuit, except that discrimination cases may be filed in district court. Kloeckner, a Department of Labor employee, filed a hostile work environment complaint with the DOL civil rights office. Following EEOC regulations, DOL completed an internal investigation; Kloeckner requested an EEOC hearing. While the EEOC case was pending, Kloeckner was fired and brought her mixed case directly to the MSPB. Concerned about duplicative expenses, she successfully moved to amend her EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and asked the MSPB to dismiss without prejudice. The MSPB granted a right to refile by January 18, 2007. The EEOC case continued until April 2007, when it was terminated as a sanction for Kloeckners discovery conduct and returned to DOL, which ruled against Kloeckner. The MSPB dismissed Kloeckners appeal as untimely. The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that the only discrimination cases that could go to district court under 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. Each referenced enforcement provision authorizes action in federal district court. Regardless of whether the MSPB dismissed on the merits or threw it out as untimely, Kloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes to district court.

				ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMMISSION v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 11597.Argued October 3, 2012Decided December 4, 2012
			

				Petitioner, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (Commission), owns and manages the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area (Management Area or Area), which comprises 23,000 acres along the Black River that are forested with multiple hardwood oak species and serve as a venue for recreation and hunting.  In 1948, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructed the Clearwater Dam (Dam) upstream from the Management Area and adopted a plan known as the Water Control Manual (Manual), which sets seasonally varying rates for the release of water from the Dam.  Periodically from 1993 until 2000, the Corps, at the request of farmers, authorized deviations from the Manual that extended flooding into the Management Areas peak timber growing season.  The Commission objected to the deviations on the ground that they adversely impacted the Management Area, and opposed the Corps proposal to make the temporary deviations part of the Manuals permanent water-release plan.  After testing the effect of the deviations, the Corps abandoned the proposed Manual revision and ceased its temporary deviations.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Commission sued the United States, alleging that the temporary deviations constituted a taking of property that entitled the Commission to compensation.  The Commission maintained that the deviations caused sustained flooding during tree-growing season, and that the cumulative impact of the flooding caused the destruction of timber in the Area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain, necessitating costly reclamation measures.  The Court of Federal Claims judgment in favor of the Commission was reversed by the Federal Circuit.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking.  It held, however, that government-induced flooding can give rise to a taking claim only if the flooding is permanent or inevitably recurring.  The Federal Circuit understood this conclusion to be dictated by Sanguinetti v. United States, 

264 U.S. 146
, and United States v. Cress, 

243 U.S. 316
.
			

				Held:Government-induced flooding temporary in duration gains no automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection.  Pp.615.
			

				
				
				(a)No magic formula enables a court to judge, in every case, whether a given government interference with property is a taking.  This Court has drawn some bright lines, but in the main, takings claims turn on situation-specific factual inquiries.  See Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 

438 U.S. 104
.
			

				
				
				As to the question whether temporary flooding can ever give rise to a takings claim, this Court has ruled that government-induced flooding, Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, and seasonally recurring flooding, Cress, 243 U.S., at 328, can constitute takings.  The Court has also ruled that takings temporary in duration can be compensable.  E.g., United States v. Causby, 

328 U.S. 256
.  This Courts precedent thus indicates that government-induced flooding of limited duration may be compensable.  None of the Courts decisions authorizes a blanket temporary-flooding exception to the Courts Takings Clause jurisprudence, and the Court declines to create such an exception in this case.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(b)In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Government relies primarily on Sanguinetti, 

264 U.S. 146
, which held that no taking occurred when a government-constructed canal overflowed onto the claimants land.  In its opinion, the Court summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the proposition that in order to create an enforceable liability against the Government, it is, at least, necessary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and constitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.  Id., at 149.  The Government urges the Court to extract from the quoted words a definitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods.  But the Court does not read the passing reference to permanence in Sanguinetti as having done so much work.  Sanguinetti was decided in 1924, well before the World War II-era cases and First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 

482 U.S. 304
, in which the Court first homed in on the matter of compensation for temporary takings.  There is no suggestion in Sanguinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of takings claims.
			

				
				
				The Court thus finds no solid grounding in precedent for setting flooding apart from other government intrusions on property.  And the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.  Its primary argument is that reversing the Federal Circuits decision risks disrupting public works dedicated to flood control.  While the public interests here are important, they are not categorically different from the interests at stake in myriad other Takings Clause cases in which this Court has rejected similar arguments when deployed to urge blanket exemptions from the 
 
Fifth Amendments instruction.
			

				
				
				The Government argues in the alternative that damage to downstream property, however foreseeable, is collateral or incidental; it is not aimed at any particular landowner and therefore is not compensable under the Takings Clause.  The Court expresses no opinion on this claim, which was first tendered at oral argument and not aired in the courts below.  For the same reason, the Court declines to address the bearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(c)When regulation or temporary physical invasion by government interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the existence velnon of a compensable taking.  See, e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 

458 U.S. 419
, n.12.  Also relevant to the takings inquiry is the degree to which the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action.  See, e.g., John Horstmann Co. v. United States, 

257 U.S. 138
.  So, too, are the character of the land at issue and the owners reasonable investment-backed expectations regarding the lands use, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 

533 U.S. 606
, as well as the severity of the interference, see, e.g., Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 130131.  In concluding that the flooding was foreseeable in this case, the Court of Federal Claims noted the Commissions repeated complaints to the Corps about the destructive impact of the successive planned deviations and determined that the interference with the Commissions property was severe.  The Government, however, challenged several of the trial courts factfindings, including those relating to causation, foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of damages.  Because the Federal Circuit rested its decision entirely on the temporary duration of the flooding, it did not address those challenges, which remain open for consideration on remand.  Pp.1415.

			Arkansas Game and Fish Commission owns and manages the Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area, 23,000 acres with multiple hardwood species and used for recreation and hunting.

The Claims Court judgment ($5,778,757) in favor of the Commission was reversed by the Federal Circuit, which held that government-induced flooding can support a taking claim only if permanent or inevitably recurring. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. Government-induced flooding of limited duration may be compensable. There is no blanket temporary-flooding exception to Takings Clause jurisprudence and no reason to treat flooding differently than other government intrusions. While the public interests are important, they are not categorically different from interests at stake in other takings cases. When regulation or temporary physical invasion by government interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the existence of a compensable taking, as are the degree to which the invasion is intended or the foreseeable result of authorized government action, the character of the land, the owners reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the severity of the interference.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L.L.C. v. EDDIE LEE HOWARD etal.
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of oklahoma
			

				No. 111377.Decided November 26, 2012
			

				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				State courts rather than federal courts are most frequently called upon to apply the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 

9 U.S.C. 1 etseq., including the Acts national policy favoring arbitration.  It is a matter of great importance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a correct interpretation of the legislation.  Here, the Oklahoma Supreme Court failed to do so.  By declaring the noncompetition agreements in two employment contracts null and void, rather than leaving that determination to the arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored a basic tenet of the Acts substantive arbitration law.  The decision must be vacated.
			

				***
			

				
				
				This dispute arises from a contract between petitioner Nitro-Lift Technologies, L.L.C., and two of its former employees.  Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and gas wells to provide services that enhance production. Respondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider entered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement with Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration clause:
			

				Any dispute, difference or unresolved question between Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the Disputing Parties) shall be settled by arbitration by a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disputing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in Houston, Texas in accordance with the rules existing at the date hereof of the American Arbitration Association.  Pet. for Cert. 5.
			

				After working for Nitro-Lift on wells in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, respondents quit and began working for one of Nitro-Lifts competitors.  Claiming that respondents had breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift served them with a demand for arbitration.  Respondents then filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County, Oklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition agreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement.  The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the contracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an arbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties disagreement.
			

				
				
				The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents appeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the matter should not be resolved by application of Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, 219A (West 2011), which limits the enforceability of noncompetition agreements.  Nitro-Lift argued that any dispute as to the contracts enforceability was a question for the arbitrator.  It relied for support as it had done before the trial courtupon several of this Courts cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that under Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 

546 U.S. 440, 
446 (2006)
, this arbitration law applies in both state and federal courts.  Record in No. 109,003 (Okla.), p. 273.
			

				
				
				The Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded.  It held that despite the [U.S.] Supreme Court cases on which the employers rely, the existence of an arbitration agreement in an employment contract does not prohibit judicial review of the underlying agreement.  2011 OK 98, 15, n.20, 16, 273 P.3d 20, 26, n.20, 27.  For that proposition, the court relied on the exhaustive overview of the United States Supreme Court decisions construing the Federal Arbitration Act in Bruner v. Timberlane Manor Ltd. Partnership, 2006 OK 90, 155 P.3d 16, which found Supreme Court jurisprudence not to inhibit our review of the underlying contracts validity.  273 P.3d, at 26.  Finding the arbitration clauses no obstacle to its review, the court held that the noncompetition agreements were void and unenforceable as against Oklahomas public policy, expressed in Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, 219A.  273 P.3d, at 27.
			

				
				
				The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision rests on adequate and independent state grounds.  Id., at 2324, n.5.  If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction over this case.  See Michigan v. Long, 

463 U.S. 1032
1044 (1983).  It is not so, however, because the courts reliance on Oklahoma law was not independentit necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal claim, which was both properly presented to and addressed by the state court.  Howell v. Mississippi, 

543 U.S. 440, 
443 (2005)
 (per curiam) (quoting Adams v. Robertson, 

520 U.S. 83, 
86 (1997)
 (per curiam)).  Nitro-Lift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the contracts validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that claim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the FAA.  [A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief ... by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds ....  Howell, supra, at 444 (quoting Baldwin v. Reese, 

541 U.S. 27, 
32 (2004)
; emphasis added).  The Oklahoma Supreme Court acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied, as well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount these controlling decisions.  Its conclusion that, despite this Courts jurisprudence, the underlying contracts validity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter-mination is all the more reason for this Court to assert jurisdiction.
			

				
				
				The Oklahoma Supreme Courts decision disregards this Courts precedents on the FAA.  That Act, which declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration, Southland Corp. v. Keating, 

465 U.S. 1, 
10 (1984)
, provides that a written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.  

9 U.S.C. 2.  It is well settled that  the substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state and federal courts.  Southland Corp., supra, at 12; see also Buckeye, supra, at 446.  And when parties commit to arbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Acts substantive law that attacks on the validity of the contract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbitration clause itself, are to be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.  Preston v. Ferrer, 

552 U.S. 346, 
349 (2008)
; see also Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 

388 U.S. 395 (1967)
.  For these purposes, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract, Buckeye, supra, at 445, and its validity is subject to initial court determination; but the validity of the remainder of the contract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the arbitrator to decide.
			

				
				
				This principle requires that the decision below be va-cated.  The trial court found that the contract contained a valid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court did not hold otherwise.  It nonetheless assumed the arbitrators role by declaring the noncompetition agreements null and void.  The state court insisted that its [own] jurisprudence controls this issue and permits review of a contract submitted to arbitration where one party assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and unenforceable.  273 P.3d, at 26.  But the Oklahoma Supreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is the supreme Law of the Land, U.S. Const., Art.VI, cl.2, and by the opinions of this Court interpreting that law.  It is this Courts responsibility to say what a statute means, and once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to respect that understanding of the governing rule of law.  Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 

511 U.S. 298, 
312 (1994)
.  Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses precisely this type of judicial hostility towards arbitration. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).
			

				
				
				The state court reasoned that Oklahomas statute addressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must govern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.  273 P.3d, at 26, n.21.  But the ancient interpretive principle that the specific governs the general (generalia specialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between laws of equivalent dignity.  Where a specific statute, for example, conflicts with a general constitutional provision, the latter governs.  And the same is true where a specific state statute conflicts with a general federal statute.  There is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. Art.VI, cl.2.  [W]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.  Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. ___, ______ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 34) (quoting AT&T Mobility LLC, supra, at ______ (slip op., at 67)).  Hence, it is for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance whether the covenants not to compete are valid as a matter of applicable state law.  See Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 445446.
			

				
				
				For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				STEVEN LEFEMINE, dba COLUMBIA CHRISTIANS FOR LIFE v. DAN WIDEMAN et al.
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
			

				No. 12168.Decided November 5, 2012
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				This case concerns the award of attorneys fees in a suit alleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction but no monetary damages was not a prevailing party under 

42 U.S.C. 1988, and so could not receive fees.  That was error.  Because the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir- cuits decision and remand for further proceedings.
			

				***
			

				
				
				Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia Christians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in which they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the availability of abortions.  On November 3, 2005, Lefemine and about 20 other CCL members conducted such a demonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood County, South Carolina.  Citing complaints about the graphic signs, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefemine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be ticketed for breach of the peace.  Lefemine objected, asserting that the officer was violating his 
 
First Amendment rights, but the threat eventually caused him to disband the protest.  See Lefemine v. Davis, 732 F.Supp. 2d 614, 617619 (SC 2010).
			

				
				
				A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to Dan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, informing him that the group intended to return to the same site with the disputed signs.  The letter cautioned that further interference would cause Lefemine to pursue all avail- able legal remedies.  Id., at 619.  Chief Deputy Mike Frederick responded that the police had not previously violated Lefemines rights, and warned that should we observe any protester or demonstrator committing the same act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the same manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal sanctions.  Ibid.  Out of fear of those sanctions, the group chose not to protest in the county for the next two years.  See ibid.
			

				
				
				On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under 

42 U.S.C. 1983 against several Greenwood County police officers alleging violations of his 
 
First Amendment rights.  Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorneys fees.  See 732 F.Supp. 2d, at 620.  Ruling on the parties dueling motions for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the defendants had infringed Lefemines rights.  See id., at 620625.  The court therefore permanently enjoined the defendants from engaging in content-based restrictions on [Lefemines] display of graphic signs under similar circumstances.  Id., at 627.  The court, however, refused Lefemines request for nominal damages, finding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the illegality of their conduct was not clearly established at the time.  See ibid.  The court as well denied Lefemines request for attorneys fees under 1988, stating that [u]nder the totality of the facts in this case the award of attorneys fees is not warranted.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorneys fees on the ground that the District Courts judgment did not make Lefemine a prevailing party under 1988.  672 F.3d 292, 302303 (2012).
				[
					1
				]
				  The court reasoned that the relief awarded did not alte[r] the relative positions of the parties: The injunction prohibited only unlawful, but not legitimate, conduct by the defendant[s], and merely ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law and safeguard [Lefemines] constitutional rights in the future.  No other damages were awarded.  Ibid.  Lefemine sought a writ of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuits determination that he was not a prevailing party under 1988.
			

				
				
				The Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act of 1976, 

90Stat.
2641, 

42 U. S. C. 1988, allows the prevailing party in certain civil rights actions, including suits brought under 1983, to recover a reasonable attorneys fee.  A plaintiff prevails, we have held, when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendants behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.  Farrar v. Hobby, 

506 U.S. 103
112 (1992).  And we have repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory judgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that test.  See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, 

488 U.S. 1, 
4 (1988)
 (per curiam).
			

				
				
				Under these established standards, Lefemine was a prevailing party.  Lefemine desired to conduct demonstrations in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant police officers had told him he could not carry.  He brought this suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself from the defendants standing threat of sanctions.  And he succeeded in removing that threat.  The District Court held that the defendants had violated Lefemines rights and enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the future.  Contrary to the Fourth Circuits view, that ruling worked the requisite material alteration in the parties relationship.  Before the ruling, the police intended to stop Lefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling, the police could not prevent him from demonstrating in that manner.  So when the District Court ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law, 672 F.3d, at 303, the relief givenas in the usual case involving such an injunctionsupported the award of attorneys fees.
			

				
				
				Because Lefemine is a prevailing party, he should ordinarily recover an attorneys fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 

461 U.S. 424, 
429 (1983)
 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither of the courts below addressed whether any special circumstances exist in this case, and we do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on which the police officers could contest liability for fees is not a question before us.  Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

				NATALIE E. TENNANT, WEST VIRGINIA SECRETARY OF STATE, etal. v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION, etal.
			

				on appeal from the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia
			

				No. 111184.Decided September 25, 2012
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Plaintiffs in this case claim that West Virginias 2011 congressional redistricting plan violates the one person, one vote principle that we have held to be embodied in ArticleI, 2, of the United States Constitution.  A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia agreed, declaring the plan null and void and enjoining West Virginias Secretary of State from implementing it.  App. to Juris. Statement 4.  The state defendants appealed directly to this Court.  See 

28 U.S.C. 1253.  Because the District Court misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v. Daggett, 

462 U.S. 725 (1983)
, and failed to afford appropriate deference to West Virginias reasonable exercise of its political judgment, we reverse.
			

				***
			

				
				
				Article I, 2, of the United States Constitution requires that Members of the House of Representatives be ap- portioned among the several States ... according to their respective Numbers and chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.  In Wesberry v. Sanders, 

376 U.S. 1 (1964)
, we held that these commands require that as nearly as is practicable one mans vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as anothers.  Id., at 78.  We have since explained that the as nearly as is practicable standard does not require that congressional districts be drawn with precise mathematical equality, but instead that the State justify population differences between districts that could have been avoided by a good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality.  Karcher, supra, at 730 (quoting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 

394 U.S. 526
531 (1969); internal quotation marks omitted).
			

				
				
				Karcher set out a two-prong test to determine whether a States congressional redistricting plan meets this standard.  First, the parties challenging the plan bear the burden of proving the existence of population differences that could practicably be avoided.  462 U.S., at 734.  If they do so, the burden shifts to the State to show with some specificity that the population differences were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.  Id., at 741, 740.  This burden is a flexible one, which depend[s] on the size of the deviations, the importance of the States interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alterna- tives that might substantially vindicate those interests yet approximate population equality more closely.  Id., at 741.  As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment.  Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4).  [W]e are willing to defer to [such] state legislative policies, so long as they are consistent with constitutional norms, even if they require small differences in the population of congressional districts.  Karcher, supra, at 740.
			

				
				
				In this case, plaintiffs claim that West Virginias redistricting plan, adopted following the 2010 decennial United States census, violates ArticleI, 2, of the United States Constitution and, separately, the West Virginia Constitution.  The 2010 census did not alter West Virginias allocation of three congressional seats.  But due to popula- tion shifts within the State, West Virginia nonetheless began redistricting to comply with the requirements in our precedents.
			

				
				
				In August 2011, the West Virginia Legislature convened an extraordinary session, and the State Senate formed a 17-member Select Committee on Redistricting.  The committee first considered a redistricting plan championed by its chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed the Perfect Plan because it achieved a population difference of a single person between the largest and smallest districts.  That appears, however, to have been the only perfect aspect of the Perfect Plan.  State legislators expressed concern that the plan contravened the States longstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two incumbents residences in the same district, and moved one-third of the States population from one district to another.
			

				
				
				The following day, members of the Redistricting Committee introduced seven additional plans.  The committee eventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal, referred to as S. B. 1008.  The full Senate rejected a ninth proposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted S. B. 1008 by a vote of 27 to 4.  The House of Delegates approved the bill without debate by a vote of 90 to 5.  Governor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August 18, 2011.
			

				
				
				S. B. 1008, codified at W.Va. Code Ann. 123 (Lexis 2012 Supp.), does not split county lines, redistrict incumbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts in the population of the current districts.  Indeed, S. B. 1008s chief selling point was that it required very little change to the existing districts: It moved just one county, representing 1.5% of the States population, from one district to another.  This was the smallest shift of any plan considered by the legislature.  S. B. 1008, however, has a population variance of 0.79%, the second highest variance of the plans the legislature considered.  That is, the population difference between the largest and smallest districts in S. B. 1008 equals 0.79% of the population of the average district.
			

				
				
				The Jefferson County Commission and two of its county commissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing S. B. 1008.  At trial, the State conceded that it could have adopted a plan with lower population variations.  The State argued, however, that legitimate state policies justified the slightly higher variances in S. B. 1008, citing this Courts statement from Karcher that [a]ny number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, making districts com- pact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.  462 U.S., at 740.  The State noted Karchers approving reference to a District Court opinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting plan with a population variance of 0.78%virtually identical to the variance in S. B. 1008.  See id., at 740741 (citing West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller, 336 F.Supp. 395 (SD W.Va. 1972)).
			

				
				
				The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction, holding that the States asserted objectives did not justify the population variance.  With respect to the objective of not splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged that West Virginia had never in its history divided a county between two or more congressional districts.  The court speculated, however, that the practice of other States dividing counties between districts may portend the eventual deletion of respecting such boundaries as a potentially legitimate justification for population variances.  App. to Juris. Statement 15, n.6.  The court also faulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing to create a contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B. 1008s entire 4,871-person varianceor even a discrete, numerically precise portion thereofwas attributable to the States interest in respecting county boundaries and noted that several other plans under consideration also did not split counties.  Id., at 15, 16.
			

				
				
				The court further questioned the States assertion that S. B. 1008 best preserved the core of existing districts.  Preserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, involved respecting the [s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area, id., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, 207 F.Supp. 2d 1280, 1286 (Kan. 2002)), not a dogged insistence that change be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi- zenry, App. to Juris. Statement 20.  The District Court concluded that although acclimating to a new congressional district and Congressperson may give rise to a modicum of anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discomfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized in Karcher as capable of legitimizing a variance.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				With respect to preventing contests between incumbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for failing to build a record linking all or a specific part of the variance to that asserted interest.  Id., at 22.  And the District Court found that although 0.79% was a minor variation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of achieving smaller variances due to improved technology meant that the same variance must now be considered major.  Because the District Court concluded that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional under ArticleI, 2, it did not reach plaintiffs challenges under the West Virginia Constitution.
			

				
				
				Chief Judge Bailey dissented.  He argued that the record demonstrated the legitimacy of the States concerns, and that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well as S. B. 1008.  He also took issue with the majoritys disregard for Karchers characterization of 0.78% as an acceptable disparity.  App. to Juris. Statement 39.
			

				
				
				We stayed the District Courts order pending appeal to this Court, 565 U.S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.
			

				
				
				Given the States concession that it could achieve smaller population variations, the remaining question under Kar- cher is whether the State can demonstrate that the population deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.  462 U.S., at 740.  Considering, as Karcher instructs, the size of the deviations, the importance of the States interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alternatives that might substan- tially vindicate those interests, id., at 741, it is clear that West Virginia has carried its burden.
			

				
				
				As an initial matter, the District Court erred in concluding that improved technology has converted a minor variation in Karcher into a major variation today.  Nothing about technological advances in redistricting and mapping software has, for example, decreased population variations between a States counties.  See id., at 733, n.5.  Thus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will inevitably have population variations between districts reflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un- evenly populated counties.  Despite technological advances, a variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilution today than in 1983, when this Court said that such a minor harm could be justified by legitimate state objectives.
			

				
				
				Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding contests between incumbents and not splitting political subdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.  See, e.g., id., at 740.  The majority cited no precedent for requiring legislative findings on the discrete, numerically precise portion of the variance attributable to each factor, and we are aware of none.
			

				
				
				The District Court dismissed the States interest in limiting the shift of population between old and new districts as ham-handed, id., at 19, because the State considered only discrete bounds of geography, rather than [s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area. Id., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286).  According to the District Court, that did not qualify as preserving the cores of prior districts under Karcher, 462 U.S., at 740741.
			

				
				
				Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher, however, our opinion made clear that its list of possible justifications for population variations was not exclusive.  See id., at 740 (Any number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, . . .).  The desire to minimize population shifts between districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.  See, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, 784 F. Supp. 585, 588589 (ED Ark. 1991), summarily affd, 

504 U. S. 952 (1992)
.  S.B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts than the alternative plansmore than four times lower than the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower than others.
			

				
				
				None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating all three of the States legitimate objectives while achieving a lower variance.  All other plans failed to serve at least one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were worse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan failed as to all three of the States objectives.  See App. to Juris. Statement 4345.  This is not to say that anytime a State must choose between serving an additional le- gitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may choose the former.  But here, given the small size of the deviations, as balanced against the importance of the States interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the lack of available alternatives that might substantially vindicate those in- terests yet approximate population equality more closely, Karcher, supra, at 741, S. B. 1008 is justified by the States legitimate objectives.
			

				
				
				Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs claims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue has not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the District Court to address the remaining claims in the first instance.  The judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

			Plaintiffs claimed that West Virginia's 2011 congressional redistricting plan violated the ""one person, one vote"" principle that the Court held to be embodied in Article I, section 2, of the United States Constitution. A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia agreed, declaring the plan ""null and void"" and enjoining West Virginia's Secretary of State from implementing it. The state defendants appealed directly to the Court. Because the District Court misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v. Daggett, and failed to afford appropriate deference to West Virginia's reasonable exercise of its political judgment, the Court reversed.

				UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11210.Argued February 22, 2012Decided June 28, 2012
			

				The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the Congressional Medal of Honor is involved.  18 U.S.C. 704 (b), (c).  Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his claim that the Act is unconstitutional.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the Act invalid under the 
 
First Amendment.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.318.
			

				617 F. 3d 1198, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded that the Act infringes upon speech protected by the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp.318.
			

				
				
				(a)The Constitution demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed invalid ... and that the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.  Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 

542 U.S. 656
.
			

				
				
				Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called fighting words, child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to prevent.
			

				
				
				Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false statements.  The Government argues that cases such as Hustler Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 

485 U.S. 46
, support its claim that false statements have no value and hence no 
 
First Amendment protection.  But all the Governments quotations derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement.  In those decisions the falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Courts analysis, but neither was it determinative.  These prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.
			

				
				
				Even when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the 
 
First Amendment; the statement must be a knowing and reckless falsehood.  See New York Times v. Sullivan, 

376 U.S. 254
.  Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.
			

				
				
				The Governments three examples of false-speech regulation that courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous 
 
First Amendment scrutiny.  The criminal prohibition of a false statement made to Government officials in communications concerning official matters, 

18 U.S.C. 1001, does not lead to the broader proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at any time, in any context.  As for perjury statutes, perjured statements lack 
 
First Amendment protection not simply because they are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments.  Finally, there are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government officer.  These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.
			

				
				
				While there may exist some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but that the Court has not yet specifically identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should constitute a new category.  Pp.310.
			

				
				
				(b)The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.  Permitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.  That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				(c)The Court applies the most exacting scrutiny in assessing content-based restrictions on protected speech.  Turner Broadcasting System Inc. v. FCC, 

512 U.S. 622
.  The Act does not satisfy that scrutiny.  While the Governments interest in protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the 
 
First Amendment requires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented.  Here, that link has not been shown.  The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim that the publics general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims such as those made by respondent.  And it has not shown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule respondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to achieve its interest.
			

				
				
				In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the restriction must be the least restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S., at 666.  Here, the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible and searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have already done.  Pp.1218.
			

				
				
				Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kagan, concluded that because the Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate constitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp. 110.
			

				
				
				(a)In determining whether a statute violates the 
 
First Amendment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit between statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature and importance of the provisions countervailing objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive alternatives.  Intermediate scrutiny describes this approach.  Since false factual statements are less likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good reason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten speech-related harm, such an approach is applied here.  Pp.13.
			

				
				
				(b)The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual statements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that they be taken as true.  Although the Court has frequently said or implied that false factual statements enjoy little 
 
First Amendment protection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 

418 U.S. 323
, those statements cannot be read to mean no protection at all.  False factual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.  Moreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby chilling a kind of speech that lies at the 
 
First Amendments heart.  See id., at 340341.  And the pervasiveness of false factual statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to prosecute falsity without more.  Those who are unpopular may fear that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.
			

				
				
				Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines making the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims.  The Act lacks any such limiting features.  Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it creates a significant risk of 
 
First Amendment harm.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(c)The Act nonetheless has substantial justification.  It seeks to protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life for their country by seeking to preserve intact the countrys recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors.  P.8.
			

				
				
				(d)It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Governments objective in less burdensome ways.  The 
 
First Amendment risks flowing from the Acts breadth of coverage could be diminished or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where such lies are likely to cause harm.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Ginsburg and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

			The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the Congressional Medal of Honor is involved, 18 U. S. C. 704 (b),(c). After pleading guilty to falsely claiming that he had received the Medal of Honor, Alvarez challenged the Act as unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit held that the Act is invalid under the First Amendment.  The Supreme Court affirmed. Characterizing the law as a content-based restriction on protected speech, the Court applied the most exacting scrutiny. Falsity alone does not take speech outside the First Amendment.  While the governments interest in protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the First Amendment requires a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented; that link was not established. The government had no evidence that the publics general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims or that counter-speech, such as the ridicule Alvarez received online and in the press, would not suffice to achieve its interest. The law does not represent the least restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.  The government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible and searchable.  Dissenting Justices Alito, Scalia, and Thomas viewed the Act as significantly limited and necessary to the important governmental objective.

				In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.  One key provision is the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage.  

26 U.S.C. 5000A.  For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.  Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a [s]hared responsibility payment to the Federal Government.  5000A(b)(1).  The Act provides that this penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individuals taxes, and shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as tax penalties.  5000A(c), (g)(1).
			

				
				
				
				
				Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion.  The current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  

42 U.S.C. 1396d(a).  The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover.  For example, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all.  1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act increases federal funding to cover the States costs in expanding Medicaid coverage.  1396d(y)(1).  But if a State does not comply with the Acts new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.  1396c.
			

				
				
				
				
				Twenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federation of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congresss spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the individual mandate.  Finding the mandate severable from the Acts other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act intact.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
			

				648 F.3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
			

				
				
				1.Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar this suit.
			

				
				
				The Anti-Injunction Act provides that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, 

26 U.S.C. 7421(a), so that those subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund.  The present challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsibility payment from those who do not comply with the individual mandate.  But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Affordable Care Act describes the payment as a penalty, not a tax.  That label cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Constitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit.  Pp.1115.
			

				
				
				2.Chief Justice Roberts concluded in Part IIIA that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congresss power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Pp.1630.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate Commerce.  Art.I, 8, cl.3 (emphasis added).  The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.  This Courts precedent reflects this understanding: As expansive as this Courts cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching activity.  E.g., United States v. Lopez, 

514 U.S. 549
.  The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity.  It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.
			

				
				
				Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority.  Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.  Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do.  The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing.  They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it.  Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers.  The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congresss power to regulate Commerce.  Pp.1627.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care Acts other reforms.  Each of this Courts prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power.  E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. ___.  The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope those who would otherwise be outside of it.  Even if the individual mandate is necessary to the Affordable Care Acts other reforms, such an expansion of federal power is not a proper means for making those reforms effective.  Pp.2730.
			

				
				
				3.Chief Justice Roberts concluded in Part IIIB that the individual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do not have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.
			

				
				
				The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.  But, for the reasons explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.  It is therefore necessary to turn to the Governments alternative argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congresss power to lay and collect Taxes.  Art.I, 8, cl.1.  In pressing its taxing power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product.  Because every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality, Hooper v. California, 

155 U.S. 648
, the question is whether it is fairly possible to interpret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 

285 U.S. 22
.  Pp.3132.
			

				
				
				4.Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part IIIC, concluding that the individual mandate may be upheld as within Congresss power under the Taxing Clause.  Pp.3344.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The Affordable Care Act describes the [s]hared responsibility payment as a penalty, not a tax.  That label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act.  It does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congresss power to tax.  In answering that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach, [d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.  United States v. Constantine, 

296 U.S. 287
.  Pp.3335.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax.  The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation.  Cf. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 

259 U.S. 20
37.  None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance.  But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.  Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.  And Congresss choice of languagestating that individuals shall obtain insurance or pay a penaltydoes not require reading 5000A as punishing unlawful conduct.  It may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance.  See New York v. United States, 

505 U.S. 144
174.  Pp.3540.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides: No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.  Art.I, 9, cl.4.  A tax on going without health insurance is not like a capitation or other direct tax under this Courts precedents.  It therefore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population.  Pp.4041.
			

				
				
				5.Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.  Pp.4558.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The Spending Clause grants Congress the power to pay the Debts and provide for the ... general Welfare of the United States.  Art.I, 8, cl.1.  Congress may use this power to establish cooperative state-federal Spending Clause programs.  The legitimacy of Spending Clause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of such programs.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 

451 U.S. 1
.  [T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.  New York v. United States, 

505 U.S. 144
.  When Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressuring the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation runs counter to this Nations system of federalism.  Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 

483 U.S. 203
.  Pp.4551.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.  

42 U.S.C. 1396c.  The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a States overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.  The Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a modification of the existing program, and that this modification is permissible because Congress reserved the right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of Medicaid.  1304.  But the expansion accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.  The original program was designed to cover medical services for particular categories of vulnerable individuals.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level.  A State could hardly anticipate that Congresss reservation of the right to alter or amend the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.  The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.  Pp.5155.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding the Secretary from applying 1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion.  See 1303.  The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act are not affected.  Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the Medicaid expansion.  Pp.5558.
			

				
				
				6.Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, is of the view that the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from withholding Medicaid funds based on a States refusal to comply with the expanded Medicaid program.  But given the majority view, she agrees with The Chief Justices conclusion in Part IVB that the Medicaid Acts severability clause, 

42 U.S.C. 1303, determines the appropriate remedy.  Because The Chief Justice finds the withholdingnot the grantingof federal funds incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate.  Even absent 1303s command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down the ACA in its entirety.  When a court confronts an unconstitutional statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 

546 U.S. 320
330.  Pp.6061.

			In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court has upheld the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. While only four Justices found its requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance (26 U.S.C. 5000A) constitutional under the Commerce Clause, Chief Justice Roberts found it constitutional by reasonably characterizing it as a tax. Chief Justice Roberts wrote: it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.""  The penalty is to be paid to the IRS, along with the individuals income taxes. In a limited ruling, the Court held that the Acts Medicaid expansion is unconstitutional in threatening states with loss of existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply, but that the penalty provision is severable (which means that failure of that provision does not cause the entire Act to fail). The Act requires that state programs provide Medicaid coverage by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, (many states now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all) and increases federal funding to cover states costs, 42 U.S.C. 1396d(y)(1).  The decision leaves intact less controversial provisions, protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, allowing children to be covered by parents insurance until age 26, and prohibiting higher costs for insuring women.

				In each of these cases, a 14-year-old was convicted of murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Jackson stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he entered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk.  Arkansas charged Jackson as an adult with capital felony murder and aggravated robbery, and a jury convicted him of both crimes.  The trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  Jackson filed a state habeas petition, arguing that a mandatory life-without-parole term for a 14-year-old violates the 
 
Eighth Amendment.  Disagreeing, the court granted the States motion to dismiss.  The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.  
			

				
				
				
				
				In No. 109646, petitioner Miller, along with a friend, beat Millers neighbor and set fire to his trailer after an evening of drinking and drug use.  The neighbor died.  Miller was initially charged as a juvenile, but his case was removed to adult court, where he was charged with murder in the course of arson.  A jury found Miller guilty, and the trial court imposed a statutorily mandated punishment of life without parole.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, holding that Millers sentence was not overly harsh when compared to his crime, and that its mandatory nature was permissible under the 
 
Eighth Amendment.
			

				Held:The 
 
Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders.  Pp. 627.
			

				
				
				(a)The 
 
Eighth Amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.  Roper v. Simmons, 

543 U.S. 551
.  That right flows from the basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to both the offender and the offense.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				Two strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate punishment come together here.  The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty.  See, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, 

554 U.S. 407
.  Several cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.  Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the 
 
Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense.  Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.  In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death.  See, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 

428 U.S. 280
 (plurality opinion).  Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life without parole for juveniles violates the 
 
Eighth Amendment.
			

				
				
				As to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purposes.  Their lack of maturity and underdeveloped sense of responsibility lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.  Roper, 543 U.S., at 569.  They are more vulnerable ... to negative influences and outside pressures, including from their family and peers; they have limited contro[l] over their own environment and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings.  Ibid.  And because a childs character is not as well formed as an adults, his traits are less fixed and his actions are less likely to be evidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].  Id., at 570.  Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.  
			

				
				
				While Grahams flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomicide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crime-specific.  Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.  Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The mandatory penalty schemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from considering youth and from assessing whether the laws harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.  This contravenes Grahams (and also Ropers) foundational principle: that imposition of a States most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.
			

				
				
				Graham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to the death penalty.  That decision recognized that life-without-parole sentences share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.  560 U.S., at ___.  And it treated life without parole for juveniles like this Courts cases treat the death penalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide offenses.  By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to the death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Courts cases demanding individualized sentencing in capital cases.  In particular, those cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth.  In light of Grahams reasoning, these decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders.  Pp. 617.
			

				
				
				(b)The counterarguments of Alabama and Arkansas are unpersuasive.  Pp.1827.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(1)The States first contend that Harmelin v. Michigan, 

501 U.S. 957
, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the 
 
Eighth Amendment.  Harmelin declined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to noncapital cases because of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.  Id., at 1006 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But Harmelin had nothing to do with children, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders.  Indeed, since Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sentencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for children.  See Roper, 

543 U.S. 551
; Graham, 560 U.S ___.
			

				
				
				The States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms for juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions impose them on at least some children convicted of murder.  In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole, this Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enactments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus against a sentence for a particular class of offenders.  But where, as here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead requires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.  See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, 

483 U.S. 66
.  
			

				
				
				In any event, the objective indicia of societys standards, Graham, 560 U.S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the 
 
Eighth Amendment.  Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty (life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invalidated in Graham.  And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 

487 U.S. 815
, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can present a distorted view.  In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there.  In those circumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so if presented with the choice).  The same is true here. Pp.1825.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(2)The States next argue that courts and prosecutors sufficiently consider a juvenile defendants age, as well as his background and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him as an adult.  But this argument ignores that many States use mandatory transfer systems.  In addition, some lodge the decision in the hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts.  And even where judges have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the decisionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child or the circumstances of his offense.  Finally, because of the limited sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard sentencing as an adult.  It cannot substitute for discretion at post-trial sentencing.  Pp. 2527.

				ARIZONA etal. v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11182.Argued April 25, 2012Decided June 25, 2012
			

				An Arizona statute known as S.B. 1070 was enacted in 2010 to address pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the State.  The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its provisions from taking effect.  Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; 5(C) makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; 6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest without a warrant a person the officer has probable cause to believe ... has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States; and 2(B) requires officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to verify the persons immigration status with the Federal Government.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had established a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The Federal Governments broad, undoubted power over immigration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, Art.I, 8, cl.4, and on its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations, see Toll v. Moreno, 

458 U.S. 1
.  Federal governance is extensive and complex.  Among other things, federal law specifies categories of aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, 

8 U.S.C. 1182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status, 1304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, 1324a; and specifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so, see 1227.  Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must decide whether to pursue removal at all.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing illegal aliens.  It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center, which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and local officials around the clock.  Pp.27.
			

				
				
				2.The Supremacy Clause gives Congress the power to preempt state law.  A statute may contain an express preemption provision, see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal law in at least two other circumstances.  First, States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.  See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 

505 U.S. 88
.  Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation so pervasive ... that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it or where a federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 

331 U.S. 218
.  Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.  Hines v. Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52
.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				3.Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S.B. 1070 are preempted by federal law.  Pp.819.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in which Congress has left no room for States to regulate.  In Hines, a state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that Congress intended its complete federal registration plan to be a single integrated and all-embracing system.  312 U.S., at 74.  That scheme did not allow the States to curtail or complement federal law or enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.  Id., at 6667.  The federal registration framework remains comprehensive.  Because Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation is impermissible.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Section 5(C)s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the federal regulatory system.  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 

535 U.S. 137
, makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify prospective employees employment authorization status, 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b).  It imposes criminal and civil penalties on employers, 1324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., 1255(c)(2), (c)(8).   IRCAs express preemption provision, though silent about whether additional penalties may be imposed against employees, does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles or impose a special burden making it more difficult to establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.  Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 

529 U.S. 861
872.  The correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized employees.  It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Congress chose.  Pp.1215.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless arrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, 6 too creates an obstacle to federal law.  As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States.  The federal scheme instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.  The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a warrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute.  If no federal warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited authority.  They may arrest an alien for being in the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation, for example, but only where the alien is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.  1357(a)(2).  Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with even greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the Federal Government.  This is not the system Congress created.  Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform an immigration officers functions.  This includes instances where the Attorney General has granted that authority in a formal agreement with a state or local government.  See, e.g., 1357(g)(1).  Although federal law permits state officers to cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States, 1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral decision to detain authorized by 6.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				4.It was improper to enjoin 2(B) before the state courts had an opportunity to construe it and without some showing that 2(B)s enforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objectives.  Pp.1924.

				Syllabus
			

				ARIZONA etal. v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11182.Argued April 25, 2012Decided June 25, 2012
			

				An Arizona statute known as S.B. 1070 was enacted in 2010 to address pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the State.  The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its provisions from taking effect.  Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; 5(C) makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; 6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest without a warrant a person the officer has probable cause to believe ... has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States; and 2(B) requires officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to verify the persons immigration status with the Federal Government.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had established a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The Federal Governments broad, undoubted power over immigration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, Art.I, 8, cl.4, and on its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations, see Toll v. Moreno, 

458 U.S. 1
.  Federal governance is extensive and complex.  Among other things, federal law specifies categories of aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, 

8 U.S.C. 1182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status, 1304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, 1324a; and specifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so, see 1227.  Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must decide whether to pursue removal at all.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing illegal aliens.  It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center, which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and local officials around the clock.  Pp.27.
			

				
				
				2.The Supremacy Clause gives Congress the power to preempt state law.  A statute may contain an express preemption provision, see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal law in at least two other circumstances.  First, States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.  See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 

505 U.S. 88
.  Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation so pervasive ... that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it or where a federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 

331 U.S. 218
.  Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.  Hines v. Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52
.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				3.Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S.B. 1070 are preempted by federal law.  Pp.819.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in which Congress has left no room for States to regulate.  In Hines, a state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that Congress intended its complete federal registration plan to be a single integrated and all-embracing system.  312 U.S., at 74.  That scheme did not allow the States to curtail or complement federal law or enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.  Id., at 6667.  The federal registration framework remains comprehensive.  Because Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation is impermissible.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Section 5(C)s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the federal regulatory system.  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 

535 U.S. 137
, makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify prospective employees employment authorization status, 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b).  It imposes criminal and civil penalties on employers, 1324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., 1255(c)(2), (c)(8).   IRCAs express preemption provision, though silent about whether additional penalties may be imposed against employees, does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles or impose a special burden making it more difficult to establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.  Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 

529 U.S. 861
872.  The correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized employees.  It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Congress chose.  Pp.1215.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless arrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, 6 too creates an obstacle to federal law.  As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States.  The federal scheme instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.  The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a warrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute.  If no federal warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited authority.  They may arrest an alien for being in the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation, for example, but only where the alien is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.  1357(a)(2).  Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with even greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the Federal Government.  This is not the system Congress created.  Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform an immigration officers functions.  This includes instances where the Attorney General has granted that authority in a formal agreement with a state or local government.  See, e.g., 1357(g)(1).  Although federal law permits state officers to cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States, 1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral decision to detain authorized by 6.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				4.It was improper to enjoin 2(B) before the state courts had an opportunity to construe it and without some showing that 2(B)s enforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objectives.  Pp.1924.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The state provision has three limitations: A detainee is presumed not to be an illegal alien if he or she provides a valid Arizona drivers license or similar identification; officers may not consider race, color, or national origin except to the extent permitted by the United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s]; and 2(B) must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.  P.20.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)This Court finds unpersuasive the argument that, even with those limits, 2(B) must be held preempted at this stage.  Pp.2024.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(1)The mandatory nature of the status checks does not interfere with the federal immigration scheme.  Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system.  In fact, Congress has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.  See 1357(g)(10)(A), 1373(c).  The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.  Cf. Whiting, 563 U.S., at ___.  Pp.2021.

			The district court entered a preliminary injunction concerning four provisions of Arizona S. B. 1070, enacted in 2010: Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; 5(C)makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in Arizona; 6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe a person has committed any offense that makes the person removable from the U.S.; and 2(B) requires officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to attempt, in some circumstances, to verify immigration status. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court affirmed in part, holding that Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 preempted.  Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, in which Congress has left no room for even complementary state laws.  Section 5(C)s criminal penalty is an obstacle to the federal regulatory system. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or employ unauthorized workers, 8 U. S. C. 1324a(a)(1)(A),(a)(2); requires employers to verify prospective employees' status; and imposes criminal and civil penalties on employers, but only imposes civil penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment.  Congress decided against criminal penalties on unauthorized employees.  Section 6 creates an obstacle to federal law by attempting to provide state officers with additional arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the federal government. Generally, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the U.S.  It was improper to enjoin section 2(B) before state courts construed it and without some showing that its enforcement actually conflicts with federal law. The mandatory nature of the status checks does not interfere with the federal scheme. Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system. It is not clear yet that 2(B), in practice, will require state officers to delay release of detainees for no reason other than to verify immigration status. That would raise constitutional concerns and would disrupt the federal framework, but the section could be read to avoid these concerns.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101121.Argued January 10, 2012Decided June 21, 2012
			

				California law permits public-sector employees in a bargaining unit to decide by majority vote to create an agency shop arrangement under which all the employees are represented by a union.  Even employees who do not join the union must pay an annual fee for chargeable expenses, i.e., the cost of nonpolitical union services related to collective bargaining.  Under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 

431 U.S. 209
, a public-sector union can bill nonmembers for chargeable expenses but may not require them to fund its political or ideological projects.  Teachers v. Hudson, 

475 U.S. 292
311, sets out requirements that a union must meet in order to collect regular fees from nonmembers without violating their rights.
			

				
				
				
				
				In June 2005, respondent, a public-sector union (SEIU), sent to California employees its annual Hudson notice, setting and capping monthly dues and estimating that 56.35% of its total expenditures in the coming year would be chargeable expenses.  A nonmember had 30 days to object to full payment of dues but would still have to pay the chargeable portion.  The notice stated that the fee was subject to increase without further notice.  That same month, the Governor called for a special election on, inter alia, two ballot propositions opposed by the SEIU.  After the 30-day objection period ended, the SEIU sent a letter to unit employees announcing a temporary 25% increase in dues and a temporary elimination of the monthly dues cap, billing the move as an Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund.  The purpose of the fund was to help achieve the unions political objectives in the special election and in the upcoming November 2006 election.  The union noted that the fund would be used for a broad range of political expenses, including television and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in our communities across California.  Nonunion employees were not given any choice as to whether they would pay into the fund.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners, on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into the fund, brought a class action against the SEIU alleging violation of their 
 
First Amendment rights.  The Federal District Court granted petitioners summary judgment.  Ruling that the special assessment was for entirely political purposes, it ordered the SEIU to send a new notice giving class members 45 days to object and to provide those who object a full refund of contributions to the fund.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Hudson prescribed a balancing test under which the proper inquiry is whether the SEIUs procedures reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer, and the nonmember employees.
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.This case is not moot.  Although the SEIU offered a full refund to all class members after certiorari was granted, a live controversy remains.  The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because that conduct could be resumed as soon as the case is dismissed.  See City of Mesquite v. Aladdins Castle, Inc., 

455 U.S. 283
.  Since the SEIU continues to defend the funds legality, it would not necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in the future.  Even if concerns about voluntary cessation were inapplicable because petitioners did not seek prospective relief, there would still be a live controversy as to the adequacy of the refund notice the SEIU sent pursuant to the District Courts order.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				2.Under the 
 
First Amendment, when a union imposes a special assessment or dues increase levied to meet expenses that were not disclosed when the regular assessment was set, it must provide a fresh notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent.  Pp.823.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)A close connection exists between this Nations commitment to self-government and the rights protected by the 
 
First Amendment, see, e.g., Brown v. Hartlage, 

456 U.S. 45
53, which creates an open marketplace in which differing ideas about political, economic, and social issues can compete freely for public acceptance without improper government interference, New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S 196, 202.  The government may not prohibit the dissemination of ideas it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement of ideas that it approves.  See, e.g., R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 

505 U.S. 377
.  And the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.  See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 

468 U.S. 609
.  Closely related to compelled speech and compelled association is compelled funding of the speech of private speakers or groups.  Compulsory subsidies for private speech are thus subject to exacting 
 
First Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless, first, there is a comprehensive regulatory scheme involving a mandated association among those who are required to pay the subsidy, United States v. United Foods, Inc., 

533 U.S. 405
, and, second, compulsory fees are levied only insofar as they are a necessary incident of the larger regulatory purpose which justified the required association, ibid.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)When a State establishes an agency shop that exacts compulsory union fees as a condition of public employment, [t]he dissenting employee is forced to support financially an organization with whose principles and demands he may disagree.  Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 

466 U.S. 435
.  This form of compelled speech and association imposes a significant impingement on 
 
First Amendment rights. Ibid.  The justification for permitting a union to collect fees from nonmembersto prevent them from free-riding on the unions effortsis an anomaly.  Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers to opt out of paying the nonchargeable portion of union duesrather than exempting them unless they opt inrepresents a remarkable boon for unions, creating a risk that the fees nonmembers pay will be used to further political and ideological ends with which they do not agree.  Thus, Hudson, far from calling for a balancing of rights or interests, made it clear that any procedure for exacting fees from unwilling contributors must be carefully tailored to minimize the infringement of free speech rights, 

475 U.S. 302
303, and it cited cases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or association must serve a compelling interest and must not be significantly broader than necessary to serve that interest.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)There is no justification for the SEIUs failure to provide a fresh Hudson notice.  Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers should not be required to fund a unions political and ideological projects unless they choose to do so after having a fair opportunity to assess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities.  475 U.S., at 303.  The SEIUs procedure cannot be considered to have met Hudsons requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on 
 
First Amendment rights.  The SEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assessment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been given the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next annual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the following year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special assessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes.  But this decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice.  In any event, even a full refund would not undo the 
 
First Amendment violations, since the 
 
First Amendment does not permit a union to extract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later paid back in full.  Pp.1417.
			

				
				
				
				
				(d)The SEIUs treatment of nonmembers who opted out when the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the 
 
First Amendment.  They were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable, electoral uses.  And the SEIUs claim that the assessment was a windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is unpersuasive.  First, the SEIUs understanding of the breadth of chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much reliance on its statistics.  Lobbying the electorate, which the SEIU claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for supporting political causes and candidates.  Second, even if the SEIUs statistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge objecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special assessment.  If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used for an upcoming years chargeable purposes, there is a risk that unconsenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little.  That risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not at stake.  If the nonmembers pay too much, their 
 
First Amendment rights are infringed.  But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to receive any payment from those employees.  Pp.1723.

475 U.S. 302
303, and it cited cases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or association must serve a compelling interest and must not be significantly broader than necessary to serve that interest.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)There is no justification for the SEIUs failure to provide a fresh Hudson notice.  Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers should not be required to fund a unions political and ideological projects unless they choose to do so after having a fair opportunity to assess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities.  475 U.S., at 303.  The SEIUs procedure cannot be considered to have met Hudsons requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on 
 
First Amendment rights.  The SEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assessment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been given the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next annual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the following year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special assessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes.  But this decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice.  In any event, even a full refund would not undo the 
 
First Amendment violations, since the 
 
First Amendment does not permit a union to extract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later paid back in full.  Pp.1417.
			

				
				
				
				
				(d)The SEIUs treatment of nonmembers who opted out when the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the 
 
First Amendment.  They were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable, electoral uses.  And the SEIUs claim that the assessment was a windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is unpersuasive.  First, the SEIUs understanding of the breadth of chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much reliance on its statistics.  Lobbying the electorate, which the SEIU claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for supporting political causes and candidates.  Second, even if the SEIUs statistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge objecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special assessment.  If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used for an upcoming years chargeable purposes, there is a risk that unconsenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little.  That risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not at stake.  If the nonmembers pay too much, their 
 
First Amendment rights are infringed.  But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to receive any payment from those employees.  Pp.1723.

			California law permits public employees to create an agency shop bargaining unit so that all employees are represented by a union. Employees who do not join must pay ""chargeable expenses;"" the union may not require nonmembers to fund ideological projects. In 2005, SEIU, a public-sector union, sent its annual ""Hudson notice,"" setting and capping monthly dues, and stating that the fee could increase without notice. That month, the Governor called for a special election on propositions opposed by SEIU. After the 30-day objection period, SEIU sent a letter announcing a temporary 25% dues increase and elimination of the cap: an ""Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund."" Nonmembers could not avoid paying. The district court entered summary judgment favoring a class of nonmembers who paid into the fund. The Ninth Circuit reversed, employing a balancing test: whether procedures reasonably accommodated interests of the union, the employer, and nonmember employees. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the case is not moot, despite SEIU offering a refund. When a state establishes an agency shop that exacts union fees as a condition of public employment, dissenting employees are forced to support an organization with whose principles they may disagree. Compulsory subsidies for private speech are subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless there is a comprehensive regulatory scheme and compulsory fees are a necessary incident of the larger regulatory purpose that justified the required association. When a union imposes a special assessment or dues increase to meet undisclosed expenses, it must provide fresh notice and may not exact funds without consent.  Failure to provide a fresh Hudson notice was unjustified; treatment of nonmembers who opted out after the initial Hudson notice also ran violated the First Amendment. They were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment even though all the money was slated for electoral uses.

				Title 

18 U.S.C. 1464 bans the broadcast of any obscene, indecent, or profane language.  The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) began enforcing 1464 in the 1970s.  In FCC v. Pacif-ica Foundation, 

438 U.S. 726
, this Court found that the Commissions order banning George Carlins Filthy Words monologue passed 
 
First Amendment scrutiny, but did not decide whether an occasional expletive ... would justify any sanction, id., at 750.  In the ensuing years, the Commission went from strictly observing the narrow circumstances of Pacifica to indicating that it would assess the full context of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than limit its regulation to an index of indecent words or pictures.  However, it continued to note the important difference between isolated and repeated broadcasts of indecent material.  And in a 2001 policy statement, it even included, as one of the factors significant to the determination of what was patently offensive, whether the material dwells on or repeats at length the offending description or depiction.
			

				
				
				
				
				It was against this regulatory background that the three incidents at issue took place.  Two concern isolated utterances of obscene words during two live broadcasts aired by respondent Fox Television Stations, Inc.  The third occurred during an episode of a television show broadcast by respondent ABC Television Network, when the nude buttocks of an adult female character were shown for approximately seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment.  After these incidents, but before the Commission issued Notices of Apparent Liability to Fox and ABC, the Commission issued its Golden Globes Order, declaring for the first time that fleeting expletives could be actionable.  It then concluded that the Fox and ABC broadcasts violated this new standard.  It found the Fox broadcasts indecent, but declined to propose forfeitures.  The Second Circuit reversed, finding the Commissions decision to modify its indecency enforcement regime to regulate fleeting expletives arbitrary and capricious.  This Court reversed and remanded for the Second Circuit to address respondents 
 
First Amendment challenges.  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 

556 U.S. 502
.  On remand, the Second Circuit found the policy unconstitutionally vague and invalidated it in its entirety.  In the ABC case, the Commission found the display actionably indecent, and imposed a $27,500 forfeiture on each of the 45 ABC-affiliated stations that aired the episode.  The Second Circuit vacated the order in light of its Fox decision.
			

				Held:Because the Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the Commissions standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague.  Pp.1118.
			

				
				
				(a)The fundamental principle that laws regulating persons or entities must give fair notice of what conduct is required or proscribed, see, e.g., Connally v. General Constr. Co., 

269 U.S. 385
, is essential to the protections provided by the 
 
Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause, see United States v. Williams, 

553 U.S. 285
, which requires the invalidation of impermissibly vague laws.  A conviction or punishment fails to comply with due process if the statute or regulation under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.  Ibid.  The void for vagueness doctrine addresses at least two connected but discrete due process concerns: Regulated parties should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly; and precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.  When speech is involved, rigorous adherence to those requirements is necessary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech.  Pp.1112.
			

				
				
				(b)These concerns are implicated here, where the broadcasters claim that the lengthy procedural history of their cases shows that they did not have fair notice of what was forbidden.  Under the 2001 Guidelines in force when the broadcasts occurred, a key consideration was whether the material dwell[ed] on or repeat[ed] at length the offending description or depiction, but in the 2004 Golden Globes Order, issued after the broadcasts, the Commission changed course and held that fleeting expletives could be a statutory violation.  It then applied this new principle to these cases.  Its lack of notice to Fox and ABC of its changed interpretation failed to give them fair notice of what is prohibited.  Williams, supra, at 304.  Pp.1213.
			

				
				
				(c)Neither of the Governments contrary arguments is persuasive.  It claims that Fox cannot establish unconstitutional vagueness because the Commission declined to impose a forfeiture on Fox and said that it would not consider the indecent broadcast in renewing station licenses or in other contexts.  But the Commission has the statutory power to take into account any history of prior offenses when setting a forfeiture penalty, 

47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(E), and the due process protection against vague regulations does not leave [regulated parties] ... at the mercy of noblesse oblige.  United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  The challenged orders could also have an adverse impact on Foxs reputation with audiences and advertisers alike. 
			

				
				
				The Government argues that ABC had notice that its broadcast would be considered indecent.  But an isolated statement in a 1960 Commission decision declaring that televising nudes might be contrary to 1464 does not suffice for the fair notice required when the Government intends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly impermissible speech.  Moreover, previous Commission decisions had declined to find isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably indecent.  In light of these agency decisions, and the absence of any notice in the 2001 Guidance that seven seconds of nude buttocks would be found indecent, ABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to being sanctioned.  Pp.1317.
			

				
				
				(d)It is necessary to make three observations about this decisions scope.  First, because the Court resolves these cases on fair notice grounds under the Due Process Clause, it need not address the 
 
First Amendment implications of the Commissions indecency policy or reconsider Pacifica at this time.  Second, because the Court rules that Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their broadcasts that their material could be found actionably indecent under then-existing policies, the Court need not address the constitutionality of the current indecency policy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and subsequent adjudications.  Third, this opinion leaves the Commission free to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal requirements and leaves courts free to review the current, or any modified, policy in light of its content and application.

				Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug Act), the 5- and 10-year mandatory minimum prison terms for federal drug crimes reflected a 100-to-1 disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger the minimums.  Thus, the 5-year minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine but 500 grams of powder, and the 10-year minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute 50 grams of crack but 5,000 grams of powder.  The United States Sentencing Commissionwhich is charged under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 with writing the Federal Sentencing Guidelinesincorporated the 1986 Drug Acts 100-to-1 disparity into the Guidelines because it believed that doing so was the best way to keep similar drug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying the Sentencing Reform Acts basic proportionality objective.  The Fair Sentencing Act, which took effect on August 3, 2010, reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the powder cocaine amounts intact.  It also directed the Sentencing Commission to make conforming amendments to the Guidelines as soon as practicable (but no later than 90 days after the Fair Sentencing Acts effective date).  The new amendments became effective on November 1, 2010.
			

				
				
				
				
				In No. 115721, petitioner Hill unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in 2007, but was not sentenced until December 2010.  Sentencing him to the 10-year minimum mandated by the 1986 Drug Act, the District Judge ruled that the Fair Sentencing Acts 5-year minimum for selling that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were committed before the Acts effective date.  In No. 115683, petitioner Dorsey unlawfully sold 5.5 grams of crack in 2008.  In September 2010, the District Judge sentenced him to the 1986 Drug Acts 10-year minimum, finding that it applied because Dorsey had a prior drug conviction and declining to apply the Fair Sentencing Act, under which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount less than 28 grams, because Dorseys offense predated that Acts effective date.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed in both cases.
			

				Held:The Fair Sentencing Acts new, lower mandatory minimums apply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders.  Pp. 1020.
			

				
				
				(a)Language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.  The general federal saving statute (1871 Act) provides that a new criminal statute that repeal[s] an older criminal statute shall not change the penalties incurred under that older statute unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.  

1 U.S.C. 109.  The word repeal applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth, see Warden v. Marrero, 

417 U.S. 653
664, and penalties are incurred under the older statute when an offender becomes subject to them, i.e., commits the underlying conduct that makes the offender liable, see United States v. Reisinger, 

128 U.S. 398
.  In contrast, the Sentencing Reform Act says that, regardless of when the offenders conduct occurs, the applicable sentencing guidelines are the ones in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.  

18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
			

				
				
				Six considerations, taken together, show that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Acts more lenient penalties to apply to offenders who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after that date.  First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply a new Acts more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders without expressly saying so in the new Act.  The 1871 Act creates what is in effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested, either expressly or by necessary implication, in a subsequent enactment.  Great Northern R.Co. v. United States, 

208 U.S. 452
.  Hence, this Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting forth an important background principle of interpretation that requires courts, before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties to a set of pre-Act offenders, to assure themselves by the plain import or fair implication of the new statute that ordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in that direction.  Second, the Sentencing Reform Act sets forth a special and different background principle in 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which applies unless ex post facto concerns are present.  Thus, new, lower Guidelines amendments apply to offenders who committed an offense before the adoption of the amendments but are sentenced thereafter.  Third, language in the Fair Sentencing Act implies that Congress intended to follow the Sentencing Reform Acts special background principle here.  Section 8 of the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission to promulgate conforming amendments to the Guidelines that achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.  Read most naturally, applicable law refers to the law as changed by the Fair Sentencing Act, including the provision reducing the crack mandatory minimums.  And consistency with other guideline provisions and with prior Commission practice would require application of the new Guidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense before the new amendments effective date but were sentenced thereafter.  Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Acts old mandatory minimums to the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3 offenders would create sentencing disparities of a kind that Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent.  Fifth, not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do more than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would make matters worse by creating new anomaliesnew sets of disproportionate sentencesnot previously present.  That is because sentencing courts must apply the new Guidelines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Acts new minimums) to pre-Act offenders, and the 1986 Drug Acts old minimums would trump those new Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of them.  Application of the 1986 Drug Act minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after the new Guidelines take effect would therefore produce a set of sentences at odds with Congress basic efforts to create more uniform, more proportionate sentences.  Sixth, this Court has found no strong countervailing considerations that would make a critical difference.  Pp.1019.
			

				
				
				(b)The new Acts lower minimums also apply to those who committed an offense prior to August 3 and were sentenced between that date and November 1, 2010, the effective date of the new Guidelines.  The Act simply instructs the Commission to promulgate new Guidelines as soon as practicable (but no later than 90 days after the Act took effect), and thus as far as Congress was concerned, the Commission might have promulgated those Guidelines to be effective as early as August 3.  In any event, courts, treating the Guidelines as advi-sory, possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.  Finally, applying the new minimums to all who are sentenced after August 3 makes it possible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition, and this Court has no reason to believe Congress would have wanted to impose an unforeseeable, potentially complex application date.  Pp.1920.

The Fair Sentencing Act, which took effect on August 3, 2010, reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the powder cocaine amounts intact.  It also directed the Sentencing Commission to make conforming amendments to the Guidelines as soon as practicable (but no later than 90 days after the Fair Sentencing Acts effective date).  The new amendments became effective on November 1, 2010.
			

				
				
				
				
				In No. 115721, petitioner Hill unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in 2007, but was not sentenced until December 2010.  Sentencing him to the 10-year minimum mandated by the 1986 Drug Act, the District Judge ruled that the Fair Sentencing Acts 5-year minimum for selling that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were committed before the Acts effective date.  In No. 115683, petitioner Dorsey unlawfully sold 5.5 grams of crack in 2008.  In September 2010, the District Judge sentenced him to the 1986 Drug Acts 10-year minimum, finding that it applied because Dorsey had a prior drug conviction and declining to apply the Fair Sentencing Act, under which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount less than 28 grams, because Dorseys offense predated that Acts effective date.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed in both cases.
			

				Held:The Fair Sentencing Acts new, lower mandatory minimums apply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders.  Pp. 1020.
			

				
				
				(a)Language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.  The general federal saving statute (1871 Act) provides that a new criminal statute that repeal[s] an older criminal statute shall not change the penalties incurred under that older statute unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.  

1 U.S.C. 109.  The word repeal applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth, see Warden v. Marrero, 

417 U.S. 653
664, and penalties are incurred under the older statute when an offender becomes subject to them, i.e., commits the underlying conduct that makes the offender liable, see United States v. Reisinger, 

128 U.S. 398
.  In contrast, the Sentencing Reform Act says that, regardless of when the offenders conduct occurs, the applicable sentencing guidelines are the ones in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.  

18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
			

				
				
				Six considerations, taken together, show that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Acts more lenient penalties to apply to offenders who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after that date.  First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply a new Acts more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders without expressly saying so in the new Act.  The 1871 Act creates what is in effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested, either expressly or by necessary implication, in a subsequent enactment.  Great Northern R.Co. v. United States, 

208 U.S. 452
.  Hence, this Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting forth an important background principle of interpretation that requires courts, before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties to a set of pre-Act offenders, to assure themselves by the plain import or fair implication of the new statute that ordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in that direction.  Second, the Sentencing Reform Act sets forth a special and different background principle in 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which applies unless ex post facto concerns are present.  Thus, new, lower Guidelines amendments apply to offenders who committed an offense before the adoption of the amendments but are sentenced thereafter.  Third, language in the Fair Sentencing Act implies that Congress intended to follow the Sentencing Reform Acts special background principle here.  Section 8 of the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission to promulgate conforming amendments to the Guidelines that achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.  Read most naturally, applicable law refers to the law as changed by the Fair Sentencing Act, including the provision reducing the crack mandatory minimums.  And consistency with other guideline provisions and with prior Commission practice would require application of the new Guidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense before the new amendments effective date but were sentenced thereafter.  Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Acts old mandatory minimums to the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3 offenders would create sentencing disparities of a kind that Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent.  Fifth, not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do more than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would make matters worse by creating new anomaliesnew sets of disproportionate sentencesnot previously present.  That is because sentencing courts must apply the new Guidelines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Acts new minimums) to pre-Act offenders, and the 1986 Drug Acts old minimums would trump those new Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of them.  Application of the 1986 Drug Act minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after the new Guidelines take effect would therefore produce a set of sentences at odds with Congress basic efforts to create more uniform, more proportionate sentences.  Sixth, this Court has found no strong countervailing considerations that would make a critical difference.  Pp.1019.
			

				
				
				(b)The new Acts lower minimums also apply to those who committed an offense prior to August 3 and were sentenced between that date and November 1, 2010, the effective date of the new Guidelines.  The Act simply instructs the Commission to promulgate new Guidelines as soon as practicable (but no later than 90 days after the Act took effect), and thus as far as Congress was concerned, the Commission might have promulgated those Guidelines to be effective as early as August 3.  In any event, courts, treating the Guidelines as advi-sory, possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.  Finally, applying the new minimums to all who are sentenced after August 3 makes it possible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition, and this Court has no reason to believe Congress would have wanted to impose an unforeseeable, potentially complex application date.  Pp.1920.

			Defendants, convicted of selling crack cocaine in 2007 and 2008, were not sentenced until 2010, after amendment of the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act eliminated a 100-to-1 disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. The Fair Sentencing Act, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), effective August 3, 2010, reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the powder cocaine amounts intact. District judges held that the amendments did not apply to those whose offenses were committed before the effective date.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated in a 5-4 decision. The new, lower mandatory minimums apply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders.  Congress intended the  more lenient penalties to apply to offenders who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after that date. Not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would preserve a disproportionate status quo and make matters worse by creating new anomalies.

				SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
			

				No. 1194.Argued March 19, 2012Decided June 21, 2012
			

				Petitioner Southern Union Company was convicted by a jury in federal court on one count of violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at a subsidiarys facility on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.  Violations of the RCRA are punishable by, inter alia, a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.  

42 U.S.C. 6928(d).  At sentencing, the probation office calculated a maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern Union violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from September 19, 2002, through October 19, 2004.  Southern Union argued that imposing any fine greater than the 1-day penalty of $50,000 would be unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 

530 U.S. 466
, which holds that the 
 
Sixth Amendments jury-trial guarantee requires that any fact (other than the fact of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Southern Union contended that, based on the jury verdict and the District Courts instructions, the only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day.  The District Court held that Apprendi applies to criminal fines, but concluded from the content and context of the verdict all together that the jury found a 762-day violation.  The court therefore set a maximum potential fine of $38.1 million, from which it imposed a fine of $6 million and a community service obligation of $12 million.  On appeal, the First Circuit disagreed with the District Court that the jury necessarily found a violation of 762 days.  But the First Circuit affirmed the sentence because it held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.
			

				Held:The rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.  Pp.316.
			

				
				
				(a)Apprendis rule is rooted in longstanding common-law practice, Cunningham v. California, 

549 U.S. 270
, and preserves the historic jury function of determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, Oregon v. Ice, 

555 U.S. 160
.  This Court has repeatedly affirmed Apprendis rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that allow judges to find facts that increase a defendants maximum authorized sentence.  See Cunningham, 549 U.S., at 274275; United States v. Booker, 

543 U.S. 220
227; Blakely v. Washington, 

542 U.S. 296
300; Ring v. Arizona, 

536 U.S. 584
589; Ap-prendi, 530 U.S., at 468469.  While the punishments at stake in these cases were imprisonment or a death sentence, there is no principled basis under Apprendi to treat criminal fines differently.  Apprendis core concernto reserve to the jury the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense, Ice, 555 U.S., at 170applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprisonment or death.  Criminal fines, like these other forms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.  Fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in colonial America and they continue to be frequently imposed today.  And, the amount of a fine, like the maximum term of imprisonment or eligibility for the death penalty, is often determined by reference to particular facts.  The Government argues that fines are less onerous than incarceration and the death sentence and therefore should be exempt from Apprendi.  But where a fine is substantial enough to trigger the 
 
Sixth Amendments jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies in full.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(b)The historical role of the jury at common law, which informs the scope of the constitutional jury right, Ice, 555 U.S., at 170, supports applying Apprendi to criminal fines.  To be sure, judges in the colonies and during the founding era had much discretion in determining whether to impose a fine and in what amount.  But the exercise of such discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose judgment within the range prescribed by statute.  530 U.S., at 481 (emphasis in original).  The more salient question is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that pegged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts.  A review of both state and federal decisions discloses that the predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.  The rule that juries must determine facts that set a fines maximum amount is an application of the two longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence on which Apprendi is based: first, the truth of every accusation against a defendant should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours.  Blakely, 542 U.S., at 301.  And second, an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to the punishment is ... no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and is no accusation in reason.  Ibid.  Contrary to the Governments contentions, neither United States v. Murphy, 16 Pet. 203, nor United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285, overcomes the ample historical evidence that juries routinely found facts that set maximum criminal fines.  Pp.814.
			

				
				
				(c)The Governments remaining arguments, echoed by the dissent, are unpersuasive.  The Government claims that facts relevant to a fines amount typically quantify the harm caused by the defendants offense, and do not define a separate set of acts for punishment.  The Government contends that only the latter determination implicates Apprendis concerns.  But this argument rests on the rejected assumption that, in determining the maximum punishment for an offense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an element of the offense and one that is a sentencing factor.  Further, the facts the District Court found in imposing a fine on Southern Union are not fairly characterized as merely quantifying the harm the company caused.
			

				
				
				The Government also argues that applying Apprendi to criminal fines will prevent States and the Federal Government from enact- ing statutes that calibrate the amount of a fine to a defendants culp-ability.  But legislatures are free to enact such statutes, so long as the statutes are administered in conformance with the 
 
Sixth Amendment.
			

				
				
				Finally, the Government contends that requiring juries to determine facts related to fines will cause confusion, prejudice defendants, or be impractical.  These policy arguments rehearse those made by the dissents in our prior Apprendi cases.  They must be rejected because the rule the Government espouses is unconstitutional.  In addition, because Apprendi is now more than a decade old, the reliance interests underlying the Governments arguments are by this point attenuated.  Pp.1416.

				WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
			

				No. 108505.Argued December 6, 2011Decided June 18, 2012
			

				At petitioners bench trial for rape, Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the Illinois State Police lab, testified that she matched a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, to a profile the state lab produced using a sample of petitioners blood.  She testified that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that business records showed that vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L.J., were sent to Cellmark and returned.  She offered no other statement for the purpose of identifying the sample used for Cellmarks profile or establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample.  Nor did she vouch for the accuracy of Cellmarks profile.  The defense moved to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, Lambatos testimony insofar as it implicated events at Cellmark, but the prosecution said that petitioners confrontation rights were satisfied because he had the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified as to the match.  The prosecutor argued that Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permitted an expert to disclose facts on which the experts opinion is based even if the expert is not competent to testify to those underlying facts, and that any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  The trial court admitted the evidence and found petitioner guilty.  Both the Illinois Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Lambatos testimony did not violate petitioners confrontation rights because Cellmarks report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				238 Ill. 2d 125, 939 N.E. 2d 268, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the form of expert testimony given in this case does not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.1033.
			

				
				
				(a)Before Crawford v. Washington, 

541 U.S. 36
, this Court took the view that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of out-of-court statements that fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.  In Crawford, the Court held that such statements could be admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.  Id., at 59.  In both Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 

557 U.S. 305
, and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. ___, two of the many cases that have arisen from Crawford, this Court ruled that scientific reports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation.  In each case, the report at issue contain[ed] a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial.  564 U.S., at ______.  Here, in contrast, the question is the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others testimonial statements if those statements are not themselves admitted as evidence.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				(b)An expert witness may voice an opinion based on facts concerning the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge of those facts.  A long tradition in American courts permits an expert to testify in the form of a hypothetical question, where the expert assumes the truth of factual predicates and then offers testimony based on those assumptions.  See Forsyth v. Doolittle, 

120 U.S. 73
.  Modern evidence rules dispense with the need for hypothetical questions and permit an expert to base an opinion on facts made known to the expert at or before the hearing, though such reliance does not constitute admissible evidence of the underlying information.  Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703.  Both Illinois and Federal Rules bar an expert from disclosing the inadmissible evidence in jury trials but not in bench trials.  This is important because Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent in other respects, reaffirmed the proposition that the Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.  541 U.S., at 59, n.9.  Pp.1316.
			

				
				
				(c)For Confrontation Clause purposes, the references to Cellmark in the trial record either were not hearsay or were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.  Pp.1627.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioners confrontation right was not violated when Lambatos answered yes to a question about whether there was a match between the DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] and the one identified as petitioners.  Under Illinois law, this putatively offending phrase was not admissible for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter assertedi.e., that the matching DNA profile was found in semen from the vaginal swabs.  Rather, that fact was a mere premise of the prosecutors question, and Lambatos simply assumed it to be true in giving her answer.  Because this was a bench trial, the Court assumes that the trial judge understood that the testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  It is also unlikely that the judge took the testimony as providing chain-of-custody evidence.  The record does not support such an understanding; no trial judge is likely to be so confused; and the admissible evidence left little room for argument that Cellmarks sample came from any source but L.J.s swabs, since the profile matched the very man she identified in a lineup and at trial as her attacker.  Pp.1621.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Nor did the substance of Cellmarks report need to be introduced in order to show that Cellmarks profile was based on the semen in L.J.s swabs or that its procedures were reliable.  The issue here is whether petitioners confrontation right was violated, not whether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support the admission of Lambatos opinion.  If there were no proof that Cellmarks profile was accurate, Lambatos testimony would be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause bars not the admission of irrelevant evidence, but the admission of testimonial statements by declarants who are not subject to cross-examination.  Here, the trial record does not lack admissible evidence with respect to the source of the sample tested by Cellmark or the reliability of its profile.  The State offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, and the match between Cellmarks profile and petitioners was telling confirmation that Cellmarks profile was deduced from the semen on L.J.s swabs.  The match also provided strong circumstantial evidence about the reliability of Cellmarks work.  Pp.2125.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)This conclusion is consistent with Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz, where forensic reports were introduced for the purpose of proving the truth of what they asserted.  In contrast, Cellmarks report was considered for the limited purpose of seeing whether it matched something else, and the relevance of that match was established by independent circumstantial evidence showing that the report was based on a sample from the crime scene.  There are at least four safeguards to prevent abuses in such situations.  First, trial courts can screen out experts who would act as conduits for hearsay by strictly enforcing the requirement that experts display genuine scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact understand the evidence or determine a fact at issue.  Fed. Rule Evid. 702(a).  Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury.  Third, if such evidence is disclosed, a trial judge may instruct the jury that the statements cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an experts opinion is only as good as the independent evidence establishing its underlying premises.  Fourth, if the prosecution cannot muster independent admissible evidence to prove foundational facts, the experts testimony cannot be given weight by the trier of fact.  Pp. 2527.
			

				
				
				
				
				(e)Even if Cellmarks report had been introduced for its truth, there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation.  The Clause refers to testimony by witnesses against an accused, prohibiting modern-day practices that are tantamount to the abuses that gave rise to the confrontation right, namely, (a) out-of-court statements having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct, and (b) formalized statements such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.  These characteristics were present in every post-Crawford case in which a Confrontation Clause violation has been found, except for Hammon v. Indiana, 

547 U.S. 813
.  But, even in Hammon, the particular statement, elicited during police interrogation, had the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.  A person who makes a statement to resolve an ongoing emergency is not like a trial witness because the declarants purpose is to bring an end to an ongoing threat.  Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  Such a statements admissibility is the concern of ... rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.   Id., ______ .  The forensic reports in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming ran afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they were the equivalent of affidavits made for the purpose of proving a particular criminal defendants guilt.  But the Cellmark reports primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time.  Nor could anyone at Cellmark possibly know that the profile would inculpate petitioner.  There was thus no prospect of fabrication and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile.  Bryant, supra, at ___, ___.  Lab technicians producing a DNA profile generally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating, exonerating, or both.  And with numerous technicians working on a profile, it is likely that each technicians sole purpose is to perform a task in accordance with accepted procedures.  The knowledge that defects in a DNA profile may be detected from the profile itself provides a further safeguard.  Pp.2833.
			

				
				
				Justice Thomas concluded that the disclosure of Cellmarks out-of-court statements through Lambatos expert testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause solely because Cellmarks statements lacked the requisite formality and solemnity to be considered testimonial, see Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Pp.116.
			

				
				
				(a)There was no plausible reason for the introduction of Cellmarks statements other than to establish their truth.  Pp.18.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base his opinion on facts about which he lacks personal knowledge and to disclose those facts to the trier of fact.  Under Illinois law, such facts are not admitted for their truth, but only to explain the basis of the experts opinion.  See People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133.  But state evidence rules do not trump a defendants constitutional right to confrontation.  This Court ensures that an out-of-court statement was introduced for a legitimate, nonhearsay purpose before relying on the not-for-its-truth rationale to dismiss the Confrontation Clauses application.  See Tennessee v. Street, 

471 U.S. 409
.  Statements introduced to explain the basis of an experts opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose because, to use the basis testimony in evaluating the experts opinion, the factfinder must consider the truth of the basis testimony.  This commonsense conclusion is not undermined by any historical practice exempting expert basis testimony from the rigors of the Confrontation Clause.  Before the Federal Rules of Evidence were adopted in 1975, an expert could render an opinion based only on facts that the expert had personally perceived or learned at trial.  In 1975, that universe of facts was expanded to include facts that the expert learned out of court by means other than his own perception.  The disclosure of such facts raises Confrontation Clause concerns.  Pp.25.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Those concerns are fully applicable here.  In concluding that petitioners DNA profile matched the profile derived from L.J.s swabs, Lambatos relied on Cellmarks out-of-court statements that its profile was in fact derived from those swabs, rather than from some other source.  Thus, the validity of Lambatos opinion ultimately turned on the truth of Cellmarks statements.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				(b)These statements, however, were not testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, which applies to witnesses against the accusedin other words, those who bear testimony.  Crawford v. Washington, 

541 U.S. 36
.  Testimony, in turn, is [a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.  Ibid.  In light of its text, the Confrontation Clause regulates only the use of statements bearing indicia of solemnity.  Davis v. Washington, 

547 U.S. 813
837, 840 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  This test comports with history because solemnity marked the practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to eliminate, namely, the exparte examination of witnesses under English bail and committal statutes.  See id., at 835.  Accordingly, the Clause reaches formalized testimonial materials, such as depositions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from formalized dialogue, such as custodial interrogation.  Bryant, supra, at ___.  Applying these principles, Cellmarks report is not a statement by a witnes[s] under the Confrontation Clause.  It lacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact.  And, although it was produced at the request of law enforcement, it was not the product of formalized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.  Melendez-Diaz,

				WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
			

				No. 108505.Argued December 6, 2011Decided June 18, 2012
			

				At petitioners bench trial for rape, Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the Illinois State Police lab, testified that she matched a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, to a profile the state lab produced using a sample of petitioners blood.  She testified that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that business records showed that vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L.J., were sent to Cellmark and returned.  She offered no other statement for the purpose of identifying the sample used for Cellmarks profile or establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample.  Nor did she vouch for the accuracy of Cellmarks profile.  The defense moved to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, Lambatos testimony insofar as it implicated events at Cellmark, but the prosecution said that petitioners confrontation rights were satisfied because he had the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified as to the match.  The prosecutor argued that Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permitted an expert to disclose facts on which the experts opinion is based even if the expert is not competent to testify to those underlying facts, and that any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  The trial court admitted the evidence and found petitioner guilty.  Both the Illinois Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Lambatos testimony did not violate petitioners confrontation rights because Cellmarks report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				238 Ill. 2d 125, 939 N.E. 2d 268, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the form of expert testimony given in this case does not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.1033.
			

				
				
				(a)Before Crawford v. Washington, 

541 U.S. 36
, this Court took the view that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of out-of-court statements that fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.  In Crawford, the Court held that such statements could be admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.  Id., at 59.  In both Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 

557 U.S. 305
, and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. ___, two of the many cases that have arisen from Crawford, this Court ruled that scientific reports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation.  In each case, the report at issue contain[ed] a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial.  564 U.S., at ______.  Here, in contrast, the question is the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others testimonial statements if those statements are not themselves admitted as evidence.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				(b)An expert witness may voice an opinion based on facts concerning the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge of those facts.  A long tradition in American courts permits an expert to testify in the form of a hypothetical question, where the expert assumes the truth of factual predicates and then offers testimony based on those assumptions.  See Forsyth v. Doolittle, 

120 U.S. 73
.  Modern evidence rules dispense with the need for hypothetical questions and permit an expert to base an opinion on facts made known to the expert at or before the hearing, though such reliance does not constitute admissible evidence of the underlying information.  Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703.  Both Illinois and Federal Rules bar an expert from disclosing the inadmissible evidence in jury trials but not in bench trials.  This is important because Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent in other respects, reaffirmed the proposition that the Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.  541 U.S., at 59, n.9.  Pp.1316.
			

				
				
				(c)For Confrontation Clause purposes, the references to Cellmark in the trial record either were not hearsay or were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.  Pp.1627.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioners confrontation right was not violated when Lambatos answered yes to a question about whether there was a match between the DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] and the one identified as petitioners.  Under Illinois law, this putatively offending phrase was not admissible for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter assertedi.e., that the matching DNA profile was found in semen from the vaginal swabs.  Rather, that fact was a mere premise of the prosecutors question, and Lambatos simply assumed it to be true in giving her answer.  Because this was a bench trial, the Court assumes that the trial judge understood that the testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  It is also unlikely that the judge took the testimony as providing chain-of-custody evidence.  The record does not support such an understanding; no trial judge is likely to be so confused; and the admissible evidence left little room for argument that Cellmarks sample came from any source but L.J.s swabs, since the profile matched the very man she identified in a lineup and at trial as her attacker.  Pp.1621.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Nor did the substance of Cellmarks report need to be introduced in order to show that Cellmarks profile was based on the semen in L.J.s swabs or that its procedures were reliable.  The issue here is whether petitioners confrontation right was violated, not whether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support the admission of Lambatos opinion.  If there were no proof that Cellmarks profile was accurate, Lambatos testimony would be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause bars not the admission of irrelevant evidence, but the admission of testimonial statements by declarants who are not subject to cross-examination.  Here, the trial record does not lack admissible evidence with respect to the source of the sample tested by Cellmark or the reliability of its profile.  The State offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, and the match between Cellmarks profile and petitioners was telling confirmation that Cellmarks profile was deduced from the semen on L.J.s swabs.  The match also provided strong circumstantial evidence about the reliability of Cellmarks work.  Pp.2125.

			In petitioner's bench trial for rape, the prosecution called an expert who testified that a DNA profile produced by an outside lab matched a profile produced by the state police lab using a sample of petitioner's blood. At issue was whether Crawford v. Washington precluded the expert witness from testifying in a manner that had long been allowed under the law of evidence. Specifically, did Crawford bar an expert from expressing an opinion based on facts about a case that have been made known to the expert but about which the expert was not competent to testify. Also at issue was whether Crawford substantially impeded the ability of prosecutors to introduce DNA evidence and thus could effectively relegate the prosecution in some cases to reliance on older, less reliable forms of proof. The Court concluded that this form of expert testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the provision had no application to out-of-court statements that were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Therefore, the Court concluded that the expert's testimony did not violate the Sixth Amendment. As a second, independent basis for the Court's decision, even if the report produced by the outside lab had been admitted into evidence, there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation.

				CHRISTOPHER etal. v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP., dba GLAXOSMITHKLINE
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11204.Argued April 16, 2012Decided June 18, 2012
			

				The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay employees overtime wages, see 

29 U.S.C. 207(a), but this requirement does not apply with respect to workers employed in the capacity of outside salesman, 213(a)(1).  Congress did not elaborate on the meaning of outside salesman, but it delegated authority to the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.  Three of the DOLs regulations are relevant to this case.  First, 29 CFR 541.500 defines outside salesman to mean any employee ... [w]hose primary duty is ... making sales within the meaning of [

29 U.S.C. 203(k)].  541.500(a)(1)(2).  Section 203(k), in turn, states that [s]ale or sell includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.  Second, 541.501 clarifies that [s]ales within the meaning of [203(k)] include the transfer of title to tangible property.  541.501(b).  Third, 541.503 provides that promotion work that is performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employees own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work, whereas promotion work that is incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.  541.503(a).  The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an outside salesman when the employee in some sense, has made sales.  69 Fed. Reg. 22162.
			

				
				
				
				
				The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physicians prescription.  In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts on physicians.  Pharmaceutical companies promote their products to physicians through a process called detailing, whereby employees known as detailers or pharmaceutical sales representatives try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from physicians to prescribe respondents products in appropriate cases.  Each week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physicians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks.  Petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and they were subject to only minimal supervision.  Petitioners were well compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a base salary and incentive pay.  The amount of incentive pay was determined based on the performance of petitioners assigned portfolio of drugs in their assigned sales territories.  It is undisputed that petitioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more than 40 hours per week.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA by failing to compensate them for overtime.  Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were employed in the capacity of outside salesman, 213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt from the FLSAs overtime compensation requirement.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.  Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the DOLs interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.  The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.  The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOLs interpretation was not entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.  
			

				Held:Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the DOLs regulations.  Pp.825.
			

				
				
				(a)The DOL filed amicus briefs in the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit in which it took the view that a sale for the purposes of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.  Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in Inre Novartis Wage and Hour Litigation, No. 090437 (CA2), p.11.  The DOL changed course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and now maintains that [a]n employee does not make a sale  . . . unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1213.  The DOLs current interpretation of its regulations is not entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 

519 U.S. 452
.  Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agencys interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461462, this general rule does not apply in all cases.  Deference is inappropriate, for example, when the agencys interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, id., at 461, or when there is reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agencys fair and considered judgment on the matter, id., at 462.  There are strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case.  Petitioners invoke the DOLs interpretation to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the interpretation was announced.  To defer to the DOLs interpretation would result in precisely the kind of unfair surprise against which this Court has long warned.  See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 

551 U.S. 158
171.  Until 2009, the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the FLSA.  The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice.  Even more important, despite the industrys decades-long practice, the DOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully.  The only plausible explanation for the DOLs inaction is acquiescence.  Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is unwarranted here.  The DOLs interpretation should instead be given a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade.  See United States v. Mead Corp., 

533 U.S. 218
.  Pp.814.
			

				
				
				(b)The DOLs current interpretationthat a sale demands a transfer of titleis quite unpersuasive.  It plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.  Because the DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public comment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOLs internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.  The interpretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA.  The statute defines sale to mean, inter alia, a consignment for sale, and a consignment for sale does not involve the transfer of title.  The DOL relies heavily on 29 CFR 541.501, which provides that [s]ales . . . include the transfer of title to tangible property, 541.501(b), but it is apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term sale.  The DOLs explanation that obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion, and not sales, Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also unconvincing.  Since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employees own sales is exempt, the DOLs conclusion that detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.  Pp.1416.  
			

				
				
				(c)Because the DOLs interpretation is neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its own right, traditional tools of interpretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen.  Pp.1624.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The FLSA does not furnish a clear answer to this question, but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone employed ... in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.  

29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1).  The statutes emphasis on capacity counsels in favor of a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an employees responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.  The DOLs regulations provide additional guidance.  Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is making sales and adopts the statu- tory definition of sale.

				CHRISTOPHER etal. v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP., dba GLAXOSMITHKLINE
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11204.Argued April 16, 2012Decided June 18, 2012
			

				The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay employees overtime wages, see 

29 U.S.C. 207(a), but this requirement does not apply with respect to workers employed in the capacity of outside salesman, 213(a)(1).  Congress did not elaborate on the meaning of outside salesman, but it delegated authority to the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.  Three of the DOLs regulations are relevant to this case.  First, 29 CFR 541.500 defines outside salesman to mean any employee ... [w]hose primary duty is ... making sales within the meaning of [

29 U.S.C. 203(k)].  541.500(a)(1)(2).  Section 203(k), in turn, states that [s]ale or sell includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.  Second, 541.501 clarifies that [s]ales within the meaning of [203(k)] include the transfer of title to tangible property.  541.501(b).  Third, 541.503 provides that promotion work that is performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employees own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work, whereas promotion work that is incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.  541.503(a).  The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an outside salesman when the employee in some sense, has made sales.  69 Fed. Reg. 22162.
			

				
				
				
				
				The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physicians prescription.  In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts on physicians.  Pharmaceutical companies promote their products to physicians through a process called detailing, whereby employees known as detailers or pharmaceutical sales representatives try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from physicians to prescribe respondents products in appropriate cases.  Each week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physicians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks.  Petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and they were subject to only minimal supervision.  Petitioners were well compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a base salary and incentive pay.  The amount of incentive pay was determined based on the performance of petitioners assigned portfolio of drugs in their assigned sales territories.  It is undisputed that petitioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more than 40 hours per week.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA by failing to compensate them for overtime.  Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were employed in the capacity of outside salesman, 213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt from the FLSAs overtime compensation requirement.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.  Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the DOLs interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.  The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.  The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOLs interpretation was not entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.  
			

				Held:Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the DOLs regulations.  Pp.825.
			

				
				
				(a)The DOL filed amicus briefs in the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit in which it took the view that a sale for the purposes of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.  Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in Inre Novartis Wage and Hour Litigation, No. 090437 (CA2), p.11.  The DOL changed course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and now maintains that [a]n employee does not make a sale  . . . unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1213.  The DOLs current interpretation of its regulations is not entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 

519 U.S. 452
.  Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agencys interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461462, this general rule does not apply in all cases.  Deference is inappropriate, for example, when the agencys interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, id., at 461, or when there is reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agencys fair and considered judgment on the matter, id., at 462.  There are strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case.  Petitioners invoke the DOLs interpretation to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the interpretation was announced.  To defer to the DOLs interpretation would result in precisely the kind of unfair surprise against which this Court has long warned.  See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 

551 U.S. 158
171.  Until 2009, the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the FLSA.  The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice.  Even more important, despite the industrys decades-long practice, the DOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully.  The only plausible explanation for the DOLs inaction is acquiescence.  Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is unwarranted here.  The DOLs interpretation should instead be given a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade.  See United States v. Mead Corp., 

533 U.S. 218
.  Pp.814.
			

				
				
				(b)The DOLs current interpretationthat a sale demands a transfer of titleis quite unpersuasive.  It plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.  Because the DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public comment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOLs internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.  The interpretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA.  The statute defines sale to mean, inter alia, a consignment for sale, and a consignment for sale does not involve the transfer of title.  The DOL relies heavily on 29 CFR 541.501, which provides that [s]ales . . . include the transfer of title to tangible property, 541.501(b), but it is apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term sale.  The DOLs explanation that obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion, and not sales, Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also unconvincing.  Since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employees own sales is exempt, the DOLs conclusion that detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.  Pp.1416.  
			

				
				
				(c)Because the DOLs interpretation is neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its own right, traditional tools of interpretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen.  Pp.1624.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The FLSA does not furnish a clear answer to this question, but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone employed ... in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.  

29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1).  The statutes emphasis on capacity counsels in favor of a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an employees responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.  The DOLs regulations provide additional guidance.  Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is making sales and adopts the statu- tory definition of sale.  This statutory definition contains at least three important textual clues.  First, the definition is introduced with the verb includes, which indicates that the examples enumerated in the text are illustrative, not exhaustive.  See Burgess v. United States, 

553 U.S. 124
, n.3.  Second, the list of transactions included in the statutory definition is modified by any, which, in the context of 203(k), is best read to mean one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind, United States v. Gonzales,

			Petitioners, employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales representatives, filed suit alleging that respondent violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 206-207, by failing to compensate them for overtime. At issue was whether the term ""outside salesman,"" as defined by the Department of Labor regulations, encompassed pharmaceutical sales representatives whose primary duty was to obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe their employer's prescription drugs in appropriate cases. The Court concluded that these employees qualified as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretations of the Department's regulations.

				The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire property for the purpose of providing land to Indians.  

25 U.S.C. 465.  Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recognized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its behalf a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band intended to use for gaming purposes.  The Secretary took title to the Bradley Property in 2009.  Respondent David Patchak, who lives near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting that 465 did not authorize the Secretary to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.  Patchak alleged a variety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of the Bands proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and requested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretarys decision to take title to the land.  The Band intervened to defend the Secretarys decision.  The District Court did not reach the merits of Patchaks suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to challenge the Secretarys acquisition of the Bradley Property.  The D.C. Circuit reversed and also rejected the Secretarys and the Bands alternative argument that sovereign immunity barred the suit.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The United States has waived its sovereign immunity from Patchaks action.  The APAs general waiver of the Federal Governments immunity from suit does not apply if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought by the plaintiff.  

5 U.S.C. 702.  The Government and Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute.  The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Governments sovereign immunity from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a right, title, or interest in real property that conflicts with a right, title, or interest the United States claims.  

28 U.S.C. 2409a(d).  But it contains an exception for trust or restricted Indian lands.  2409a(a).
			

				
				
				To determine whether the Indian lands exception bars Patchaks suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of grievance Patchak advances.  It does not, because Patchaks action is not a quiet title action.  The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of quiet title actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone elses claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed property.  Although Patchaks suit contests the Secretarys title, it does not claim any competing interest in the Bradley Property.
			

				
				
				Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA does not more broadly encompass any civil action ... to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.  2409(a).  Rather, 2409a includes a host of indications that the civil action at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit.  The Band and Government also contend that the QTAs specific authorization of adverse claimants suits creates the negative implication that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government ownership of land under any statute.  That argument is faulty for the reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses.  Finally, the Band and Government argue that Patchaks suit should be treated the same as an adverse claimants because both equally implicate the Indian lands exceptions policies.  That argument must be addressed to Congress.  The Indian lands exception reflects Congresss judgment about how far to allow quiet title suitsnot all suits challenging the Governments ownership of property.  Pp.414.
			

				
				
				2.Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretarys acquisition.  A person suing under the APA must assert an interest that is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute that he says was violated.  Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 

397 U.S. 150
.  The Government and Band claim that Patchaks economic, environmental, and aesthetic injuries are not within 465s zone of interests because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchaks injuries relate to the lands use as a casino.  However, 465 has far more to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRAs land provisions, and functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes economic development.  The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye toward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.  The Departments regulations make this statutory concern with land use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.  And because 465 encompasses lands use, neighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonableindeed, predictablechallengers of the Secretarys decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental, or aesthetic, come within 465s regulatory ambit.  Pp.1418.
			

				632 F.3d 702, affirmed and remanded.

			Petitioner requested that the Secretary of the Interior take into trust on its behalf a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which petitioner intended to use ""for gaming purposes."" The Secretary took title to the property and respondent subsequently filed suit under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 500 et seq., asserting that the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), 25 U.S.C. 465, did not authorize the Secretary to acquire the property because petitioner was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. At issue was whether the United States had sovereign immunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act (QTA), 86 Stat. 1176, and whether respondent had prudential standing to challenge the Secretary's acquisition. The Court held that the United States had waived its sovereign immunity from respondent's action under the QTA. The Court also held that respondent had prudential standing to challenge the Secretary's acquisition where respondent's interests came within section 465's regulatory ambit.

				SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, etal. v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 11551.Argued April 18, 2012Decided June 18, 2012
			

				The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with willing tribes under which they will provide services such as education and law enforcement that the Federal Government otherwise would have provided.  It requires the Secretary to contract to pay the full amount of contract support costs, 45 U.S.C. 450j1(a)(2), (g), subject to the availability of appropriations, 450j1(b).  In the event of a contractual breach, tribal contractors are entitled to seek money damages under the Contract Disputes Act.
			

				
				
				
				
				In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent Tribes contracted with the Secretary to provide services.  During each of those FYs, Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay any individual tribal contractors contract support costs in full but did not appropriate enough to pay all tribal contractors collectively.  Unable to pay every contractor in full, the Secretary paid the Tribes on a uniform, prorata basis.  Respondents sued under the Contract Disputes Act for breach of contract.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, finding the Government liable to each contractor for the full contract amount.
			

				Held:The Government must pay each Tribes contract support costs in full.  Pp.518.
			

				
				
				(a)In Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 

543 U.S. 631
, this Court considered the Governments promise to pay contract support costs in ISDA self-determination contracts that made the Governments obligation subject to the availability of appropriations, id., at 634637.  The Government contended that Congress appropriated inadequate funds to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Tribes, while meeting the agencys competing fiscal priorities.  Because Congress appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts, however, the Court held that the Government was obligated to pay those costs in full absent something special about the promises, id., at 637638.
			

				
				
				That conclusion followed directly from well-established principles of Government contracting law: When a Government contractor is one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient in itself to pay the contractor, the Government is responsible to the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible ends.  See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546.  That is so even if an agencys total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all of its contracts.  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.S., at 637.  This principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States.  Contractors need not keep track of agencies shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its contractual promises.  And the rule furthers the Governments own long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad workaday transaction of its agencies.  United States v. Winstar Corp., 

518 U.S. 839
.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris control here.  Once Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise on grounds of insufficient appropriations, even if the contract uses language such as subject to the availability of appropriations, and even if an agencys total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.S., at 637.  That condition is satisfied here, because Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual contractor in full.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government attempts to distinguish Ferris and Cherokee Nation on the ground that they involved unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations, while Congress here appropriated not to exceed a certain amount for contract support costs.  The effect of the appropriations in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress identified.  The not to exceed language still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.
			

				
				
				Section 450j1(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for one tribes programs to make funds available to another tribe, does not warrant a different result.  Consistent with ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely underscores the Secretarys discretion to allocate funds among tribes.  It does not alter the Governments legal obligation when the Secretary fails to pay.
			

				
				
				The Governments remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, it suggests that the Secretary could violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prevents federal officers from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation.  That Act applies only to government officials, however, and does not affect the rights of citizens contracting with the Government.  Second, the Government argues that permitting respondents to recover from the Judgment Fund would circumvent Congress intent to cap total expenditures for contract support costs.  But ISDA expressly provides that tribal contractors may sue for money damages under the Contract Disputes Act, and any ensuing judgments are payable from the Judgment Fund.  See Cherokee Nation, 543 U.S., at 642.  Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts have rejected contractors attempts to recover for amounts beyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose.  See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, 

256 U.S. 575
.  However, Sutton involved a specific line-item appropriation for an amount beyond which the sole contractor could not recover.  This case involves several contractors, each of whom contracted within the lump-sum amount Congress appropriated for all contractors.  Unlike the sole contractor in Sutton, they cannot reasonably be expected to know how much remained available of Congress lump-sum appropriation.  Finally, the Government claims that legislative history suggests that Congress approved of prorata distribution, but indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirement on the agency.

				(d)This case is the product of two decisions in some tension: Congress required the Secretary to accept every qualifying ISDA contract, promising full funding for all contract support costs, but then appropriated insufficient funds to pay in full each tribal contractor.

				SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, etal. v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 11551.Argued April 18, 2012Decided June 18, 2012
			

				The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with willing tribes under which they will provide services such as education and law enforcement that the Federal Government otherwise would have provided.  It requires the Secretary to contract to pay the full amount of contract support costs, 45 U.S.C. 450j1(a)(2), (g), subject to the availability of appropriations, 450j1(b).  In the event of a contractual breach, tribal contractors are entitled to seek money damages under the Contract Disputes Act.
			

				
				
				
				
				In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent Tribes contracted with the Secretary to provide services.  During each of those FYs, Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay any individual tribal contractors contract support costs in full but did not appropriate enough to pay all tribal contractors collectively.  Unable to pay every contractor in full, the Secretary paid the Tribes on a uniform, prorata basis.  Respondents sued under the Contract Disputes Act for breach of contract.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, finding the Government liable to each contractor for the full contract amount.
			

				Held:The Government must pay each Tribes contract support costs in full.  Pp.518.
			

				
				
				(a)In Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 

543 U.S. 631
, this Court considered the Governments promise to pay contract support costs in ISDA self-determination contracts that made the Governments obligation subject to the availability of appropriations, id., at 634637.  The Government contended that Congress appropriated inadequate funds to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Tribes, while meeting the agencys competing fiscal priorities.  Because Congress appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts, however, the Court held that the Government was obligated to pay those costs in full absent something special about the promises, id., at 637638.
			

				
				
				That conclusion followed directly from well-established principles of Government contracting law: When a Government contractor is one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient in itself to pay the contractor, the Government is responsible to the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible ends.  See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546.  That is so even if an agencys total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all of its contracts.  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.S., at 637.  This principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States.  Contractors need not keep track of agencies shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its contractual promises.  And the rule furthers the Governments own long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad workaday transaction of its agencies.  United States v. Winstar Corp., 

518 U.S. 839
.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris control here.  Once Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise on grounds of insufficient appropriations, even if the contract uses language such as subject to the availability of appropriations, and even if an agencys total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.S., at 637.  That condition is satisfied here, because Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual contractor in full.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government attempts to distinguish Ferris and Cherokee Nation on the ground that they involved unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations, while Congress here appropriated not to exceed a certain amount for contract support costs.  The effect of the appropriations in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress identified.  The not to exceed language still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.
			

				
				
				Section 450j1(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for one tribes programs to make funds available to another tribe, does not warrant a different result.  Consistent with ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely underscores the Secretarys discretion to allocate funds among tribes.  It does not alter the Governments legal obligation when the Secretary fails to pay.

			The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA), 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq., directed the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with willing tribes, pursuant to which those tribes would provide services such as education and law enforcement that otherwise would have been provided by the Federal government. ISDA mandated that the Secretary shall pay the full amount of ""contract support costs"" incurred by tribes in performing their contracts. At issue was whether the Government must pay those costs when Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay in full any individual contractor's contract support costs, but not enough funds to cover the aggregate amount due every contractor. The Court held that, consistent with longstanding principles of Government contracting law, the Government must pay each tribe's contract support costs in full.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
			

				No. 1145.Argued February 27, 2012Decided June 11, 2012
			

				The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees, United States v. Fausto, 

484 U.S. 439
, including removals, 

5 U.S.C. 7512.  A qualifying employee has the right to a hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), 7513(d), 7701(a)(1)(2), which is authorized to order reinstatement, backpay, and attorneys fees, 1204(a)(2), 7701(g).  An employee who is dissatisfied with the MSPBs decision is entitled to judicial review in the Federal Circuit.  7703(a)(1), (b)(1).
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners were federal employees discharged pursuant to 

5 U.S.C. 3328, which bars from Executive agency employment anyone who has knowingly and willfully failed to register for the Selective Service as required by the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 453.  Petitioner Elgin challenged his removal before the MSPB, claiming that 3328 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitutionally discriminates based on sex when combined with the Military Selective Service Acts male-only registration requirement.  The MSPB referred the case to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB review of agency action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment.  The ALJ also concluded that the MSPB lacked authority to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute.  Rather than seeking further MSPB review or appealing to the Federal Circuit, Elgin joined other petitioners raising the same constitutional challenges to their removals in a suit in Federal District Court.  The District Court found that it had jurisdiction and denied petitioners constitutional claims on the merits.  The First Circuit vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The First Circuit held that petitioners were employees entitled to MSPB review despite the statutory bar to their employment.  The court further concluded that challenges to a removal are not exempt from the CSRA review scheme simply because an employee challenges the constitutionality of the statute authorizing the removal.
			

				Held:The CSRA precludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners claims because it is fairly discernible that Congress intended the statutes review scheme to provide the exclusive avenue to judicial review for covered employees who challenge covered adverse employment actions, even when those employees argue that a federal statute is unconstitutional.  Pp.520.
			

				
				
				(a)Relying on Webster v. Doe, 

486 U.S. 592
, petitioners claim that 

28 U.S.C. 1331s general grant of federal-question jurisdiction to district courts remains undisturbed unless Congress explicitly directs otherwise.  But Websters heightened showing applies only when a statute purports to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim, 486 U.S., at 603, not when Congress channels judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court, see Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 

510 U.S. 200
.  Here, where the claims can be meaningfully addressed in the Federal Circuit, id., at 215, the proper inquiry is whether Congress intent to preclude district court jurisdiction was fairly discernible in the statutory scheme, id., at 207.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)It is fairly discernible from the CSRAs text, structure, and purpose that Congress precluded district court jurisdiction over petitioners claims.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Just as the CSRAs elaborate framework demonstrated Congress intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to whom the CSRA denies statutory review in Fausto, 484 U.S., at 443, the CSRA indicates that extrastatutory review is not available to those employees to whom the CSRA grants administrative and judicial review.  It prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to adverse personnel actions against federal employees, ibid., specifically enumerating the major adverse actions and employee classifications to which the CSRAs procedural protections and review provisions apply, 7511, 7512, setting out the procedures due an employee prior to final agency action, 7513, and exhaustively detailing the system of review before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, 7701, 7703.  Petitioners and the Government do not dispute that petitioners are removed employees to whom CSRA review is provided, but petitioners claim that there is an exception to the CSRA review scheme for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal statutes; this claim finds no support in the CSRAs text and structure.  The availability of administrative and judicial review under the CSRA generally turns on the type of civil service employee and adverse employment action at issue.  Nothing in the CSRAs text suggests that its exclusive review scheme is inapplicable simply because a covered employee raises a constitutional challenge.  And 7703(b)(2)which expressly exempts from Federal Circuit review challenges alleging that a covered action was based on discrimination prohibited by enumerated federal employment lawsdemonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums for judicial review based on the nature of an employees claim.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The CSRAs purpose also supports the conclusion that the statutory review scheme is exclusive, even for constitutional challenges.  The CSRAs objective of creating an integrated review scheme to replace inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative judicial review would be seriously undermined if a covered employee could challenge a covered employment action first in a district court, and then again in a court of appeals, simply by challenging the constitutionality of the statutory authorization for the action.  Claim-splitting and preclusion doctrines would not necessarily eliminate the possibility of parallel proceedings before the MSPB and the district court, and petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to support the notion that Congress intended to allow employees to pursue constitutional claims in district court at the expense of forgoing other, potentially meritorious claims before the MSPB.  Pp.1012.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners invoke the presum[ption] that Congress does not intend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review; if the suit is wholly collateral to a statutes review provisions; and if the claims are outside the agencys expertise.  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. ___, ___.  But none of those characteristics is present here.  Pp.1220.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioners constitutional claims can receive meaningful review within the CSRA scheme even if the MSPB, as it claims, is not authorized to decide a federal laws constitutionality.  Their claims can be meaningfully addressed in the Federal Circuit, which has held that it can determine the constitutionality of a statute upon which an employees removal was based, notwithstanding the MSPBs professed lack of authority to decide the question.  The CSRA review scheme also fully accommodates the potential need for a factual record.  Even without factfinding capabilities, the Federal Circuit may take judicial notice of facts relevant to the constitutional question.  If further development is necessary, the CSRA empowers the MSPB to take evidence and find facts for Federal Circuit review.  See 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(1)(2).  Petitioners err in arguing that the MSPB will invariably dismiss a case without ever reaching the factfinding stage in an appeal such as theirs.  The MSPB may determine that it lacks authority to decide the issue; but absent another infirmity in the adverse action, it will affirm the employing agencys decision.  The Federal Circuit can then review the decision, including any factual record developed by the MSPB.  Petitioners argument is not illustrated by Elgins case, which was dismissed on the threshold ground that he was not an employee with a right to appeal because his employment was absolutely barred by statute.  Pp.1218.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Petitioners claims are also not wholly collateral to the CSRA scheme.  Their constitutional claims are the vehicle by which they seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal employment, and to receive lost compensation.  A challenge to removal is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme, and reinstatement, backpay, and attorneys fees are precisely the kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and the Federal Circuit to provide.  Pp.1819.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Finally, in arguing that their constitutional claims are not the sort that Congress intended to channel through the MSPB because they are beyond the MSPBs expertise, petitioners overlook the many threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and to which the MSPB can apply its expertise, e.g., whether a resignation, as in petitioner Tuckers case, amounts to a constructive discharge.  Pp.1920.
			

				641 F.3d 6, affirmed.

			Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., certain federal employees could obtain administrative and judicial review of specified adverse employment actions. At issue was whether the CSRA provided the exclusive avenue to judicial review when a qualifying employee challenged an adverse employment action by arguing that a federal statute was unconstitutional. The Court held that it did.

				PHILIP PARKER, WARDEN v. DAVID EUGENE MATTHEWS
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 11845.Decided June 11, 2012
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				In this habeas case, the United States Court of Ap- peals for the Sixth Circuit set aside two 29-year-old murder convictions based on the flimsiest of rationales.  The courts decision is a textbook example of what the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) proscribes: using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state courts.  Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12).  We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.
			

				I
			

				
				
				Between 1 and 2 a.m. on the morning of June 29, 1981, respondent David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louisville home he had until recently shared with his estranged wife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene).  At the time, Matthews mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying at the home with her daughter.  Matthews found Cruse in bed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a gun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before.  Matthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went into the next room, where he found his wife.  He had sexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her until about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her.  Cruse would die from her wound later that day.
			

				
				
				Matthews was apprehended that morning at his mothers house, where he had already begun to wash the clothes he wore during the crime.  Later in the day, police officers found the murder weapon secreted below the floorboards of a backyard shed on the property.  At the police station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement to a police detective in which he denied responsibility for the murders.
			

				
				
				A grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders and for burglary.  At trial, he did not contest that he killed the two victims.  Instead, he sought to show that he had acted under extreme emotional disturbance, which under Kentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would otherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. 507.020(1)(a), 507.030(1)(b) (West 2006).  As support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the troubled history of his marriage with Marlene.  Matthews and his wife had been frequently separated from one another, and their periods of separation were marked by extreme hostility.  Marlene would regularly procure criminal warrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders she obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of Marlenes 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Matthews spending roughly three weeks in jail.  Witnesses also testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews when they were together and would yell at him from across the street when they were separated; and Matthews mother recounted that Marlene would leave the couples young child crying in the street late at night outside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order to antagonize him.
			

				
				
				Matthews also introduced the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews.  Dr. Chutkow related what Matthews had told him about the murders, including that Matthews had been drinking heav- ily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug.  Dr. Chut- kow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suf- fering from an adjustment disorder, which he described as a temporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in individuals who are subject to a variety of stresses, that would temporarily impair a persons judgment and cause symptoms such as anxiety, nervousness, depression, even suicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.  6 Record 558.  Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that Matthews was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murdersin particular, that he experienced extreme tension, irritability, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife, id., at 567, whom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated him.
			

				
				
				The jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was sentenced to death.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews 37 claims of error.  Matthews v. Commonwealth, 709 S.W. 2d 414, 417 (1985).  In response to Matthews argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had acted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the court concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews conduct before, during and after the offense was more than sufficient to support the jurys findings of capital murder.  Id., at 421.  A claim that the prosecutor had committed misconduct during his closing argument was rejected on the merits, but without discussion.
			

				
				
				Following an unsuccessful state postconviction proceeding, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 

28 U.S.C. 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  Matthews contended, among other things, that the Kentucky Supreme Court had contravened clearly established federal law in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed with instructions to grant relief.  651 F.3d 489 (2011).
			

				II
			

				
				
				Under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Supreme Courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  

28 U.S.C. 2254(d).  The Sixth Circuit gave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was entitled to relief under this difficult to meet ... and highly deferential standard, Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither is valid.
			

				A
			

				
				
				First, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme Court had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews committed his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on extreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Kentucky Supreme Courts decision in Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S.W. 2d 97, 108 (1980), which placed the burden of producing evidence on the defendant, but left the bur- den of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturbance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the defendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the issue.  According to the Sixth Circuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed from that understanding in Matthews case and placed the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance entirely on the defendant, 651 F.3d, at 500.  
			

				
				
				The Sixth Circuits interpretation is supported by certain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Courts opinion in Matthews case.  For example, the state court indicated that Matthews had present[ed] extensive evidence of his extreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence he had presented far from overwhelming, rather than by stating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt.  Matthews, 709 S.W. 2d, at 420421.  The state court also observed that it had recently clarified in Wellman v. Com- monwealth, 694 S.W. 2d 696 (1985), that absence of extreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the crime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirmatively prove.  Matthews, supra, at 421.  In the Sixth Circuits view, the Kentucky Supreme Courts reliance on this Wellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in resolving Matthews appeal violated the Due Process Clause, as construed by this Court in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 

378 U.S. 347, 
354 (1964)
, because it involved the retroactive application of an unexpected and indefensible judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.
			

				
				
				The Kentucky Supreme Courts initial assessment of the evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant if they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.  It is not clear, however, that they did.  The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that [t]he trial courts instructions in regard to extreme emotional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported the jurys findings of intentional murder.  709 S.W. 2d, at 421.  Those jury instructions required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable justification or excuse under the circumstances as he believed them to be.  6 Record 625, 628629.  The case had been submitted to the jury with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Supreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that finding.  That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews claim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a ground of questionable validity.  See Wetzel v. Lambert, 565 U.S. ___, ______ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 45).
				[
					1
				]
				
			

				
				
				The Sixth Circuits opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme emotional disturbance.  We have said that it is the responsibility of the jurynot the courtto decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial, Cavazos v. Smith, 

565 U.S. 1
, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).  The evidence is sufficient to support a conviction whenever, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jackson v. Virginia, 

443 U.S. 307, 
319 (1979)
.  And a state-court decision rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on federal habeas unless the decision was objectively unreasonable.  Cavazos, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).
			

				
				
				In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abundantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Courts rejection of Matthews sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal habeas proceeding.  The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr. Chutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on cross-examination.  But there was ample evidence pointing in the other direction as well.  As the Kentucky Supreme Court observed, Matthews claim of extreme emo- tional disturbance was belied by the circumstances of the crime, 709 S.W. 2d, at 421including the facts that he borrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day of the murders, that he waited several hours after buying the gun before starting for his wifes home, and that he delayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law and killing his wife.  The claim was also belied by his behavior after the murders, including his [taking] steps to hide the gun and clean his clothes, and later giv[ing] a false statement to the police.  Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit discounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified that Matthews deliberateness and consciousness of wrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of extreme emotional disturbance.  651 F.3d., at 504, n.4.  But expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive presumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable to conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the tension between Dr. Chutkows testimony and their own common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.  In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkows testi- mony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its authority.  See Jackson, supra, at 326.
			

				
				
				More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to consider the possibility that the jury could have found the symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter under Kentucky law: that Matthews acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendants situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. 507.020(1)(a).  Dr. Chutkow himself agreed that many people face tension and anxietytwo symptoms he attributed to Matthews.  6 Record 579580.  And he agreed that many people suffer from adjustment disorders.  Id., at 592.  But of course very few people commit murders.  In light of these points, which bear on the proper characterization of Matthews mental condition and the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme Court made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance was properly committed to the jury for resolution.
			

				B
			

				
				
				As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit held that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument constituted a denial of due process.  This claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky Supreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.  See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).  The clearly established Federal law relevant here is our decision in Darden v. Wainwright, 

477 U.S. 168 (1986)
, which explained that a prosecutors improper comments will be held to violate the Constitution only if they so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.  Id., at 181 (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 

416 U.S. 637, 
643 (1974)
).
			

				
				
				According to the Sixth Circuit, the prosecutor violated Darden by suggesting that Matthews had colluded with his lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manufacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense.  But although the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the prosecutors closing argument which could be understood as raising a charge of collusion,
				[
					2
				]
				 the court did not address the prosecutors statement that immediately followed the quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of collusion:
			

				And thats not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.  Not at all.  He is entitled to the best defense he can get, but thats the only defense he has, what the doctor has to say, and thats not to say that the doctor gets on the stand and perjures himself.  Hes telling you the truth.  He wouldnt perjure himself for anything.  Hes telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentlemen.  7 Record 674.
			

				With the prosecutors immediate clarification that he was not alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuits conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly violated due process is unsupportable.  Nor does the prosecutors suggestion that Matthews had enhance[d] his story to Doctor Chutkow, ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth Circuits grant of habeas relief.  In context, that statement is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews had a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in his meetings with Dr. Chutkow.  Shortly after the quoted statement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhetorical questions:
			

				Dont you think he would exaggerate his fears about his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other people might be doing to his mother?  Dont you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist?  Ibid.
			

				The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court in support of its conclusion that due process prohibits a prosecutor from emphasizing a criminal defendants motive to exaggerate exculpatory facts.
			

				
				
				The Sixth Circuit also suggested that the prosecutor denigrated the [extreme emotional disturbance] defense itself, 651 F.3d, at 506, by stating that [i]ts the defense of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen.  He has no excuse for his conduct, but thats his only way out.  7 Record 674.  But the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood this comment too as having been directed at Matthews motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbancei.e., as emphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense raised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional disturbance.
			

				
				
				Moreover, even if the comment is understood as directing the jurys attention to inappropriate considerations, that would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme Courts rejection of the Darden prosecutorial misconduct claim was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  Harrington, 562 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Indeed, Darden itself held that a closing argument considerably more inflammatory than the one at issue here did not warrant habeas relief.  See 477 U.S., at 180, n. 11 (prosecutor referred to the defendant as an animal); id., at 180, n. 12 (I wish I could see [the defendant] with no face, blown away by a shotgun).  Particularly because the Darden standard is a very general one, leaving courts more leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations, Yarborough v. Alvarado, 

541 U.S. 652, 
664 (2004)
), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside the Kentucky Supreme Courts conclusion.
			

				
				
				The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the reasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Courts decision.  After quoting the governing standard from our decision in Darden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would engag[e] in a two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality.  To satisfy the standard ... , the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.  651 F.3d, at 505 (quoting Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)).  It went on to evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four factors derived from its own precedent: (1) the likelihood that the remarks ... tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against [Matthews].  651 F.3d, at 506 (quoting Broom, supra, at 412).  And it stated that the prosecutors comments in this case were sufficiently similar to certain comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in Gall II, 231 F.3d 265 (CA6 2000), that they rise to the level of impropriety.  651 F.3d, at 506.
			

				
				
				As we explained in correcting an identical error by the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 1112), circuit precedent does not constitute clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, 

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  It therefore cannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA.  Nor can the Sixth Circuits reliance on its own precedents be defended in this case on the ground that they merely reflect what has been clearly established by our cases.  The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here.  To make matters worse, the Sixth Circuit decided Gall II under pre-AEDPA law, see 231 F.3d, at 283, n.2, so that case did not even purport to reflect clearly established law as set out in this Courts holdings.  It was plain and repetitive error for the Sixth Circuit to rely on its own precedents in granting Matthews habeas relief.

				ARMOUR etal. v. CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, etal.
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of indiana
			

				No. 11161.Argued February 29, 2012Decided June 4, 2012
			

				For decades, Indianapolis (City) funded sewer projects using Indianas Barrett Law, which permitted cities to apportion a public improvement projects costs equally among all abutting lots.  Under that system, a city would create an initial assessment, dividing the total estimated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary adjustments.  Upon a projects completion, the city would issue a final lot-by-lot assessment.  Lot owners could elect to pay the assessment in a lump sum or over time in installments.
			

				
				
				
				
				After the City completed the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Project, it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment obligations.  Of the 180 affected homeowners, 38 elected to pay the lump sum.  The following year, the City abandoned Barrett Law financing and adopted the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which financed projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering individual owners sewer-connection costs.  In implementing STEP, the Citys Board of Public Works enacted a resolution forgiving all assessment amounts still owed pursuant to Barrett Law financing.  Homeowners who had paid the Brisbane/Manning Project lump sum received no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay in installments were under no obligation to make further payments.
			

				
				
				
				
				The 38 homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the City for a refund, but the City denied the request.  Thirty-one of these homeowners brought suit in Indiana state court claiming, in relevant part, that the Citys refusal violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.  The trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Indiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Citys distinction between those who had already paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing financial hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources.
			

				Held:The City had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.614.
			

				
				
				(a)The Citys classification does not involve a fundamental right or suspect classification.  See Heller v. Doe, 

509 U.S. 312
320.  Its subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial.  See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 

304 U.S. 144
.  It is a tax classification.  See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 

461 U.S. 540
.  And no one claims that the City has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new residents.  Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 

472 U.S. 612
.  Hence, the Citys distinction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification, FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 

508 U.S. 307
, and the burden is on the one attacking the [classification] to negative every conceivable basis which might support it, Heller, supra, at 320.  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				(b)Administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a tax-related distinction, see, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 

301 U.S. 495
512, and the Citys decision to stop collecting outstanding Barrett Law debts finds rational support in the Citys administrative concerns.  After the City switched to the STEP system, any decision to continue Barrett Law debt collection could have proved complex and expensive.  It would have meant maintaining an administrative system for years to come to collect debts arising out of 20-plus different construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action.  The rationality of the Citys distinction draws further support from the nature of the line-drawing choices that confronted it.  To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding further administrative costs, namely the cost of processing refunds.  And limiting refunds only to Brisbane/Manning homeowners would have led to complaints of unfairness, while expanding refunds to the apparently thousands of other Barrett Law project homeowners would have involved an even greater administrative burden.  Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the City drewdistinguishing past payments from future obligationsis well known to the law.  See, e.g., 

26 U.S.C. 108(a)(1)(E).  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  Whether financial hardship is a factor supporting rationality need not be considered here, since the Citys administrative concerns are sufficient to show a rational basis for its distinction.  Petitioners propose other forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the Citys system, but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the City be rational.  Petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considerations.  Here it was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums for years to come.  Petitioners have not shown that the administrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.  Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence.  The one exception, Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 

488 U.S. 336
, is distinguishable.  Pp.1014.

			An Indiana statute, the ""Barrett Law,"" Ind. Code 36-9-15(b)(3), authorized Indiana's cities to impose upon benefited owners the cost of sewer improvement projects. The Law also permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately in the form of a lump sum or over time in installments. In 2005, the city of Indianapolis adopted a new assessment and payment method, the ""STEP"" plan, and it forgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had not yet paid. A group of lot owners who had already paid their entire Barrett Law assessment in a lump sum believed that the City should have provided them with equivalent refunds. At issue was whether the City's refusal to do so unconstitutionally discriminated against them in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, section 1. The Court held that the City had a rational basis for distinguishing between those lot owners who had already paid their share of project costs and those who had not. Therefore, the Court concluded that there was no equal protection violation.

				No. 11262.Argued March 21, 2012Decided June 4, 2012
			

				Petitioners Reichle and Doyle were members of a Secret Service detail protecting Vice President Richard Cheney while he greeted members of the public at a shopping mall.  Agent Doyle overheard respondent Howards, who was speaking into his cell phone, state that he was going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids hes killed today.  Doyle and other agents observed Howards enter the line to meet the Vice President, tell the Vice President that his policies in Iraq are disgusting, and touch the Vice Presidents shoulder as the Vice President was leaving.  After being briefed by Doyle, Agent Reichle interviewed and then arrested Howards, who was charged with harassment.  After that charge was dismissed, Howards brought an action against petitioners and others under 

42 U.S.C. 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 

403 U.S. 388
.  Howards claimed that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in violation of the 
 
Fourth Amendment, and that the arrest violated the 
 
First Amendment because it was made in retaliation for Howards criticism of the Vice President.  Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the Federal District Court denied the motion.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the 
 
Fourth Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards, but the court affirmed with regard to the 
 
First Amendment claim.  In doing so, the court rejected petitioners argument that, under Hartman v. Moore, 

547 U.S. 250
, probable cause to arrest defeats a 
 
First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.  It concluded instead that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory arrest violates the 
 
First Amendment even if supported by probable cause.
			

				Held:Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because, at the time of Howards arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a 
 
First Amendment violation.  Pp.512.
			

				
				
				(a)Courts may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not clearly established by prior case law.  Pearson v. Callahan,

.  To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would [have understood] that what he is doing violates that right.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)The clearly established standard is not satisfied here.  This Court has never recognized a 
 
First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause; nor was such a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards arrest.  P.6.
			

				
				
				(c)At that time, Hartmans impact on the Tenth Circuits precedent was far from clear.  Although Hartmans facts involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reasonable law enforcement officers could have questioned whether its rule also applied to arrests.  First, Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly.  It resolved a Circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory prosecution claims, but some of the conflicting cases involved both retaliatory prosecution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no distinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable cause.  Second, a reasonable official could have interpreted Hartmans rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests.  Like in retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually all retaliatory arrest cases, and the causal link between the defendants alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiffs injury may be tenuous.  Finally, decisions from other Circuits in the wake of Hartman support the conclusion that, for qualified immunity purposes, it was at least arguable at the time of Howards arrest that Hartman extended to retaliatory arrests.

			This case arose when respondent brought an action against petitioners, two Secret Service agents, and others, under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, claiming that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the arrest violated the First Amendment because it was made in retaliation for respondent's criticism of Vice President Cheney. At issue was whether two federal law enforcement agents were immune from suit for allegedly arresting a suspect in retaliation for his political speech, when the agents had probable cause to arrest the suspect for committing a federal crime. The Court held that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity because, at the time of respondent's arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a First Amendment violation.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				BRIAN COLEMAN, SUPERINTENDENT, STATE COR- RECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT FAYETTE, etal. v. LORENZO JOHNSON
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 111053.Decided May 29, 2012
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an accomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in the early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Har- risburg, Pennsylvania.  After his conviction was affirmed in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 

28 U.S.C. 2254.  The District Court denied habeas relief but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support Johnsons conviction under the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 

443 U.S. 307 (1979)
.
			

				
				
				We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference.  First, on direct appeal, it is the responsibility of the jurynot the courtto decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial.  A reviewing court may set aside the jurys verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury. Cavazos v. Smith, 

565 U.S. 1
, ___ (2011) (percuriam) (slip op., at 1).  And second, on habeas review, a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court.  The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was objectively unreasonable.  Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)).
			

				
				
				Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania, we now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.
			

				***
			

				
				
				The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed by Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder.  Johnson was with Walker on the night of the crime, and the two were tried jointly.  Johnson was charged as an accomplice and co-conspirator.  See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. 2502 (2008) (defining first-degree murder as willful, deliberate and premeditated killing); 306(c) (imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense ... aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it); Commonwealth v. Montalvo, 598 Pa. 263, 274, 956 A.2d 926, 932 (2008) (criminal conspiracy liability for anyone who takes an overt act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or commit).
			

				
				
				At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who testified that she, Johnson, and Walker were close friends who ran the streets together.  Tr. 213.  On the morning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the same residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams.  Walker announced that he was going to holler at Williams about a debt Williams owed.  Id., at 217.  According to Doubs, Walker and Williams were talking about the money that [Williams] had owed us, with Walker asking [Williams], confronting him, about his money and whats up with the money and why is it taking you so long to give us the money.  Id., at 217218.  Williams was cussing [Walker] out, telling him hed give it to him when he felt like it and he aint scared of [Walker].  Id., at 218.  A fight ensued, which ended when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front of the crowd of people that had gathered.
			

				
				
				After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker was mad, because he got beat by a crackhead.... He was saying, yo, that crackhead beat me.  Im going to kill that crackhead.  Im going to kill that kid.... He was hot.  He was heated.  Id., at 220221.  Johnson was present when Walker made these statements.  Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted the beating to others, who laughed at Walker.  Walker repeated it for a while that Im going to kill that kid.  That kid must think Im some type of joke.  Im going to kill that kid.  Who he think he is[?]  Id., at 222.  Once again, Johnson was present for these statements.
			

				
				
				Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim, who testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar on the night of December 1415, where she saw Walker, Johnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument.  Although she could not hear what they were saying, she could tell they were arguing because they were making a lot of arm movements.  Id., at 104.  The bouncer soon told them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street because she wanted to know what was going on.  Ibid.  Brown observed the three men walking in a single-file line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and Johnson in the back.  Walker was wearing a long leather coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it.  Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to go ahead and pass.  Id., at 107.  Walker then entered the alleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained standing at the entrance.  As Brown walked past the alley, she heard a loud boom, causing her to run away.  Id., at 143.  On cross-examination, Brown stated: They walked [Williams] in that alley.  He stood inside the alley.  He walked him in the alley.  I heard a boom.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at 12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15.  He heard a loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes fleeing.
			

				
				
				After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey, who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at the time of the murder.  He testified that he saw Williams walking toward an alleyway with two males and a female, and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered the alley.  When pressed on cross-examination, he stated: I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.  Id., at 189.
			

				
				
				The jury also heard testimony from police who searched the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun with the barrel missing.  A medical examiner who examined Williams body testified that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest.
			

				
				
				After the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.  The court denied his motion, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal.  See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726 A.2d 1079 (1998).  After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief.  He then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, which denied his claims.  See Johnson v. Mechling, 541 F.Supp. 2d 651 (MD Pa. 2008).  Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third Circuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his conviction overturned.
			

				
				
				Under Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  443 U.S., at 319.
			

				
				
				In light of the testimony at Johnsons trial, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that [a] trier of fact could reasonably infer ... that Johnson and Walker shared a common intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.  Johnson v. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011).  As for the notion that Johnson shared Walkers intent to kill Williams, however, the court concluded that was mere speculation that no rational factfinder could accept as true.  Ibid.  The court stated that a reasonable inference is one where the fact inferred is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.  Id., at 539540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland, 452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A.2d 592, 594 (1973)).  In order for a jurys inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned, they must flow from facts and circumstances proven in the record that are of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence.  446 Fed. Appx., at 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A.2d 543, 560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).
			

				
				
				At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what distinguishes a reasoned inference from mere speculation.  Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state law for the substantive elements of the criminal offense, 443 U.S., at 324, n.16, but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law.
			

				
				
				Under the deferential federal standard, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un- duly impinged on the jurys role as factfinder.  Jackson leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring only that jurors draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.  Id., at 319.  This deferential standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged.  For example, in addressing Brown and Ramseys testimony that Williams was walked and forced into the alleyway, the court objected that the witnesses did not describe any physical action supporting the conclusion that force was used.  446 Fed. Appx., at 541.  Absent some specific testimony that Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented him from leaving it, ibid., the court could see no reason- able basis for the jurys conclusion that Johnson had a specific intent to help kill Williams.
			

				
				
				That analysis is flawed for two reasons.  First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walkers behavior could be inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon, and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams after a violent confrontation earlier in the day.  Johnson and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams from fleeing.  And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the murder.
			

				
				
				Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker ran the streets together, and had attempted to collect a debt from Williams earlier on the day of the murder.  Williams resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in the process by giving him a public thrashing with a broomstick.  This enraged Walker to the point that he repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnsons presence that he intended to kill Williams.  Then, while Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley, where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.
			

				
				
				On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate.  The jury in this case was convinced, and the only question under Jackson is whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality.  The state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA, 

28 U.S.C. 2254(d).
			

				
				
				Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnsons trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson.  The evidence was sufficient to convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams.  The Commonwealths petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
			

				No. 11166.Argued April 23, 2012Decided May 29, 2012
			

				To finance the purchase of a commercial property and associated renovation and construction costs, petitioners (debtors) obtained a secured loan from an investment fund, for which respondent (Bank) serves as trustee.  The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Pursuant to 

11 U.S.C. 1129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to confirm a cramdown bankruptcy plan over the Banks objection.  That plan proposed selling substantially all of the debtors property at an auction, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank.  Under the debtors proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as credit-bidding.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors request, concluding that the auction procedures did not comply with 1129(b)(2)(A)s requirements for cramdown plans.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that 1129(b)(2)(A) does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid. 
			

				Held:The debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Banks lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale.  Pp.310.
			

				
				
				(a)A Chapter 11 plan proposed over the objection of a class of secured claims must meet one of three requirements in order to be deemed fair and equitable, and therefore confirmable.  The secured creditor may retain its lien on the property and receive deferred cash payments, 1129(b)(2)(A)(i); the debtors may sell the property free and clear of the lien, subject to section 363(k)which permits the creditor to credit-bid at the saleand provide the creditor with a lien on the sale proceeds, 1129(b)(2)(A)(ii); or the plan may provide the secured creditor with the indubitable equivalent of its claim, 1129(b)(2)(A)(iii).
			

				
				
				Here, the debtors proposed to sell their property free and clear of the Banks liens and repay the Bank with the sale proceeds, as contemplated by clause (ii).  Because the debtors auction procedures do not permit the Bank to credit-bid, however, the proposed sale cannot satisfy the requirements of clause (ii).  The debtors claim their plan can instead satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with the indubitable equivalent of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated by the auction.  
			

				
				
				The debtors reading of 1129(b)(2)(A), under which clause (iii) permits precisely what clause (ii) proscribes, is hyperliteral and contrary to common sense.  [I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.  Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 

504 U.S. 374
.  Here, where general and specific authorizations exist side-by-side, the general/specific canon avoids rendering superfluous a specific provision that is swallowed by the general one.  See D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 

285 U.S. 204
.  As applied to 1129(b)(2)(A), the canon provides that the general language of clause (iii), although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in clause (ii).  285 U.S., at 208.  Although the canon can be overcome by other textual indications of statutory meaning, the debtors point to none here.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(b)None of the debtors objections to this approach is valid.  Pp.89. 
			

				651 F.3d 642, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Kennedy, J., who took no part in the decision of the case.

			Debtors obtained a secured loan from an investment fund, for which the Bank served as trustee. Debtors ultimately became insolvent, seeking relief under 11 U.S.C. 1129(b)(2)(A), where debtors sought to confirm a ""cramdown"" bankruptcy plan over the Bank's objection. The Bankruptcy Court denied debtors' request, concluding that the auction procedures did not comply with section 1129(b)(2)(A)'s requirements for cramdown plans and the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The Court held that debtors could not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provided for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank's lien, but did not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

				The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), provides, as relevant here, that [n]o person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service ... other than for services actually performed.  

12 U.S.C. 2607(b).  Petitioners, three couples who obtained mortgage loans from respondent, filed separate state-court actions, alleging that respondent had violated 2607(b) by charging them fees for which no services were provided in return.  After the cases were removed to federal court and consolidated, respondent sought summary judgment, arguing that petitioners claims were not cognizable under 2607(b) because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with another party.  The District Court agreed; and because petitioners had not alleged any splitting of fees, it granted respondent summary judgment.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:In order to establish a violation of 2607(b), a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons.  Pp.313.
			

				
				
				(a)Section 2607(b) unambiguously covers only a settlement-service providers splitting of a fee with one or more other persons; it cannot be understood to reach a single providers retention of an unearned fee.  Pp. 311.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Section 2607(b) clearly describes two distinct exchanges.  First, a charge is made to or received from a consumer by a settlement-service provider.  That provider then give[s], and another person accept[s], a portion, split, or percentage of the charge.  Congresss use of different sets of verbs, with distinct tenses, to distinguish between the consumer-provider transaction and the fee-sharing one would be pointless if, as petitioners contend, the two transactions could be collapsed into one.  Their readingthat a settlement-service provider can make a charge and then accept the portion of the charge consisting of 100 percentdoes not avoid collapsing the sequential relationship of the two stages and would destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two (i.e., a giving and accepting).  And if the consumer were the person who give[s] a portion, split, or percentage of the charge to the provider who accepts it, consumers would become lawbreakers themselves.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The normal usage of the terms portion, split, and percentagewhich, when referring to a portion or percentage of a whole, usually mean less than 100 percentreinforces the conclusion that 2607(b) does not apply where a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer.  The meaning is also confirmed by the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis, which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.  United States v. Williams, 

553 U.S. 285
.  This connation is not undermined by the canon against surplusage.  Portion, split, and percentage may all mean the same thing, but the canon merely favors that interpretation which avoids surplusage, see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd.

				(b)Petitioners arguments in favor of their contrary interpretation are unpersuasive.

				BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas
			

				No. 101320.Argued February 22, 2012Decided May 24, 2012
			

				The State of Arkansas charged petitioner Alex Blueford with capital murder for the death of a one-year-old child.  That charge included the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.  Before the start of deliberations, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree....  If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt on the charge of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter.... If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.  The court also presented the jury with a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of them.  Acquitting on some but not others was not an option.
			

				
				
				
				
				After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could not reach a verdict.  The court inquired about the jurys progress on each offense.  The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide.  The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.  The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial.  When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder charges on double jeopardy grounds.  The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.
			

				Held:The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on charges of capital murder and first-degree murder.  Pp.510.
			

				
				
				(a)The jury did not acquit Blueford of capital or first-degree murder.  Blueford contends that the forepersons report that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.  But the report was not a final resolution of anything.  When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jurys deliberations had not yet concluded.  The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the courts instructions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital and first-degree murder as deliberations continued.  The forepersons report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses.  That same lack of finality undermines Bluefords reliance on Green v. United States, 

355 U.S. 184
, and Price v. Georgia, 

398 U.S. 323
.  In both of those cases, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report of the foreperson was not.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)The trial courts declaration of a mistrial was not improper.  A trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when particular circumstances manifest a necessity to declare a mistrial.  Wade v. Hunter, 

336 U.S. 684
.  Blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree murder, given the forepersons report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges.  According to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken some action, whether through new partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.  Blueford acknowledges, however, that the trial courts reason for declaring a mistrial herethat the jury was unable to reach a verdicthas long been considered the classic basis establishing necessity for doing so.  Arizona v. Washington, 

434 U.S. 497
.  And this Court has never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasselet alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.  See Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  As permitted under Arkansas law, the jurys options in this case were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another optionthat of acquitting on some offenses but not others.  Pp.910.

			This case arose when defendant was charged with capital murder for the death of a one-year-old. Before the jury concluded deliberations, it reported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide. The trial court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the trial court declared a mistrial. All agreed that defendant could be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide. At issue was whether defendant could also be retried on charges of capital and first-degree murder. The Court concluded that the jury in this case did not convict defendant of any offense, but it did not acquit him of any either. When the jury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a consequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101472.Argued February 21, 2012Decided May 21, 2012
			

				Title 

28 U.S.C. 1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, includes compensation of interpreters among the costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits.  1920(6).  In this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the prevailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner.  The award included the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain documents that respondent used in preparing its defense.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that 1920(6) covers the cost of translating documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.
			

				Held:Because the ordinary meaning of interpreter is someone who translates orally from one language to another, the category compensation of interpreters in 1920(6) does not include the cost of document translation.  Pp.315.
			

				
				
				(a)Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court.  That provision defines the term costs as used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties.  Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 

482 U.S. 437
.  As originally configured, 1920 contained five categories of taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which added a sixth category that includes compensation of interpreters.  1920(6).  Pp.35.
			

				
				
				(b)Because the term interpreter is not defined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be given its ordinary meaning.  Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 

513 U.S. 179
.  When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries defined interpreter as one who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.  Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined interpreter and interpret in terms of oral translation.  Respondent relies almost exclusively on a version of Websters Third New International Dictionary that defined interpreter as one that translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.  Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one who translates orally, that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition one that translates.  That a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.  See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 

490 U.S. 296
.  Although all relevant dictionaries defined interpreter at the time of the statutes enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials.  Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative, recognized that interpreter can mean one who translates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.  Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.  Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of interpreter does not include those who translate writings.  Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in 1920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning.  If anything, the statutory context suggests that interpreter includes only those who translate orally.  See 

28 U.S.C. 1827.  Moreover, Congress use of technical terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and translators, who are used for written communications.  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				(c)No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordinary meaning of interpreter.  This Court has never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in 1920.  To the contrary, the Court has made clear that the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Crawford Fitting, supra, at 442, but is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in 1920, ibid.  This Courts conclusion is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are limited by statute and modest in scope.  Respondents extratextual argumentsthat documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely writtenare more properly directed at Congress.  In any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of interpreter in 1920(6).  Pp.1215.
			

				633 F.3d 1218, vacated and remanded.

That a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.  See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 

490 U.S. 296
.  Although all relevant dictionaries defined interpreter at the time of the statutes enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials.  Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative, recognized that interpreter can mean one who translates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.  Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.  Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of interpreter does not include those who translate writings.  Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in 1920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning.  If anything, the statutory context suggests that interpreter includes only those who translate orally.  See 

28 U.S.C. 1827.  Moreover, Congress use of technical terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and translators, who are used for written communications.  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				(c)No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordinary meaning of interpreter.  This Court has never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in 1920.  To the contrary, the Court has made clear that the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Crawford Fitting, supra, at 442, but is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in 1920, ibid.  This Courts conclusion is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are limited by statute and modest in scope.  Respondents extratextual argumentsthat documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely writtenare more properly directed at Congress.  In any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of interpreter in 1920(6).  Pp.1215.

			This case arose from a personal injury action brought by petitioner, a professional baseball player in Japan, against respondent, the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Islands. The costs that could be awarded to prevailing parties in lawsuits brought in federal court were set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1920. The Court Interpreters Act amended that statute to include ""compensation of interpreters."" At issue was whether ""compensation of interpreters"" covered the cost of translating documents. Because the ordinary meaning of the word ""interpreter"" was a person who translated orally from one language to another, the Court held that ""compensation of interpreters"" was limited to the cost of oral translation and did not include the cost of document translation.

				Title 

8 U.S.C. 1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things, has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least five years, 1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, 1229b(a)(2).  These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) should impute a parents years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child.  That issue arises because a child may enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his parents doesmeaning that a parent may satisfy 1229b(a)(1) or 1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not.  In Inre Escobar, 24 I.&N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien must meet 1229b(a)s requirements on his own.  But the Ninth Circuit found the Boards position unreasonable, holding that 1229b(a)(1) and 1229b(a)(2) require imputation.  See Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old.  Martinez Gutierrezs father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.  But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003.  Two years after that, he was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border.  Admitting the offense, he sought cancellation of removal.  The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his fathers immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could not satisfy 1229b(a)(1) or 1229b(a)(2) on his own.  Relying on Escobar, the BIA reversed.  The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrezs petition for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old.  At that time, his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry.  After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August 2002, the Government began removal proceedings.  The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he could not satisfy 1229b(a)(2).  The BIA affirmed, and Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review.  There, he argued that the Board should have counted his mothers years of residency while he was a minor toward 1229b(a)(2)s 7-year continuous-residency requirement.  The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the BIA.  
			

				Held:The BIAs rejection of imputation is based on a permissible construction of 1229b(a).  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				(a)The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy 1229b(a)s requirements on his own, without relying on a parents years of continuous residence or immigration status.  That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.  See e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

467 U.S. 837
844, and n.11.  The BIAs approach satisfies this standard.
			

				
				
				The Boards position is consistent with the statutes text.  Section 1229b(a) does not mentionmuch less requireimputation.  Instead, it simply calls for the alien to meet the prerequisites for cancellation of removal.  See 1101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33).  Respondents contend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so, that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy.  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				(b)Neither does the statutes history and context mandate imputation.  Section 1229b(a) replaced former 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years in this country.  Like 1229b(a), 212(c) was silent on imputation.  But every Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in determining eligibility for 212(c) relief, the Board should impute a parents years of domicile to his or her child.  Based on this history, Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood 1229b(a)s language to provide for imputation.  But in enacting 1229b(a), Congress eliminated the very termdomicileon which the appeals courts had founded their imputation decisions.  And the doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 

543 U.S. 335
.
			

				
				
				Nor do the INAs purposes demand imputation.  As respondents correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with strong ties to this country.  But these are not the INAs only goals, and Congress did not pursue them at all costs.  For example, aliens convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see 1229b(a)(3).  In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.  A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				(c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the Boards position is not entitled to Chevron deference.  First, they claim that the Boards approach to 1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is inconsistent with the Boards acceptance of imputation under other, similar provisions that are silent on the matter.  See 1182(k) and 1181(b).  But the Boards decision in Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an aliens state of mind, while declining to impute objective conditions or characteristics.  See 24 I.&N. Dec., at 233234, and n.4.  Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration status and place of residence.  See id., at 233.  So the Boards approach to 1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward distinction.
			

				
				
				Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice.  But Escobar belies this contention.  The Board did explain how 1229b(a)s text supports its no-imputation policy.  But the Board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under 1229b(a) would create anomalies in the statutory scheme.  Escobar thus expressed the BIAs view that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation.  In making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.  Pp.1013.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 11159.Argued March 19, 2012Decided May 21, 2012
			

				Eighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, respondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using her husbands frozen sperm.  Karen applied for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District Court affirmed.  In accord with the SSAs construction of the Social Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as 

42 U.S.C. 416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession.  The Third Circuit reversed.  It concluded that, under 416(e), which defines child to mean, inter alia, the child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individual, the undisputed biological children of an insured and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state intestacy law.  
			

				Held:The SSAs reading is better attuned to the statutes text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime.  Moreover, even if the SSAs longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

467 U.S. 837
.  Pp.416.
			

				
				
				(a)Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant here, [e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title) of a deceased insured individual shall be entitled to a childs insurance benefit.  402(d).  Section 416(e), in turn, defines child to mean: (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3) ... the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].  Unlike 416(e)(2) and (3), 416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits.  Section 416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term child, providing: In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individuals domiciliary State].  An applicant who does not meet 416(h)(2)(A)s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for benefits under other criteria set forth in 416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria.  Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track 416(h)(2) and (3) in defining [w]ho is the insureds natural child, 20 CFR 404.355.  As the SSA reads the statute, 

42 U.S.C. 416(h) governs the meaning of child in 416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a child must pass.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)While the SSA regards 416(h) as completing 416(e)s sparse definition of child, the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends, that 416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couples biological child.  There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuits and respondents reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive interpretation.  Pp.715.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Nothing in 416(e)s tautological definition suggests that Congress understood the word child to refer only to the children of married parents.  The dictionary definitions offered by respondent are not so confined.  Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see 402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term child.  Nor does 416(e) indicate that Congress intended biological parentage to be prerequisite to child status.  A biological parent is not always a childs parent under law.  Furthermore, marriage does not necessarily make a childs parentage certain, nor does the absence of marriage necessarily make a childs parentage uncertain.  Finally, it is far from obvious that respondents proposed definition would cover her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The SSA finds a key textual cue in 416(h)(2)(A)s opening instruction: In determining whether an applicant is the child ... of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law.  Respondent notes the absence of any cross-reference in 416(e) to 416(h), but she overlooks that 416(h) provides the crucial link:  It requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for 416(h) purposes, but for purposes of this subchapter, which includes both 402(d) and 416(e).  Having explicitly complemented 416(e) by the definitional provisions contained in 416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in 416(e).
			

				
				
				The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status, including an applicants status as a wife, widow, husband, or widower.  See, e.g., 416(b), (h)(1)(A).  The Act also sets duration-of-relationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 

422 U.S. 749
782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.  In contrast, no time constraint attends the Third Circuits ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits, no matter the length of time between the fathers death and the childs conception and birth. 
			

				
				
				Because a child who may take from a fathers estate is more likely to be dependent during the parents life and at his death, Mathews v. Lucas, 

427 U.S. 495
, reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a child serves the Acts driving objective, which is to provide ... dependent members of [a wage earners] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insureds] earnings, Califano v. Jobst, 

434 U.S. 47
.  Although the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows, as respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a 416(h) criterion.  Respondent charges that the SSAs construction of the Act raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause.  But under rational-basis review, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress easily passes inspection.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				(c)Because the SSAs interpretation of the relevant provisions, is at least reasonable, the agencys reading is entitled to this Courts deference under Chevron, 

467 U.S. 837
.  Chevron deference is appropriate when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.  United States v. Mead Corp., 

533 U.S. 218
227.  Here, the SSAs longstanding interpretation, set forth in regulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is neither arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.  Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  It therefore warrants the Courts approbation.  Pp.1516.

Moreover, even if the SSAs longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

467 U.S. 837
.  Pp.416.
			

				
				
				(a)Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant here, [e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title) of a deceased insured individual shall be entitled to a childs insurance benefit.  402(d).  Section 416(e), in turn, defines child to mean: (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3) ... the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].  Unlike 416(e)(2) and (3), 416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits.  Section 416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term child, providing: In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individuals domiciliary State].  An applicant who does not meet 416(h)(2)(A)s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for benefits under other criteria set forth in 416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria.  Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track 416(h)(2) and (3) in defining [w]ho is the insureds natural child, 20 CFR 404.355.  As the SSA reads the statute, 

42 U.S.C. 416(h) governs the meaning of child in 416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a child must pass.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)While the SSA regards 416(h) as completing 416(e)s sparse definition of child, the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends, that 416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couples biological child.  There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuits and respondents reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive interpretation.  Pp.715.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Nothing in 416(e)s tautological definition suggests that Congress understood the word child to refer only to the children of married parents.  The dictionary definitions offered by respondent are not so confined.  Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see 402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term child.  Nor does 416(e) indicate that Congress intended biological parentage to be prerequisite to child status.  A biological parent is not always a childs parent under law.  Furthermore, marriage does not necessarily make a childs parentage certain, nor does the absence of marriage necessarily make a childs parentage uncertain.  Finally, it is far from obvious that respondents proposed definition would cover her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The SSA finds a key textual cue in 416(h)(2)(A)s opening instruction: In determining whether an applicant is the child ... of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law.  Respondent notes the absence of any cross-reference in 416(e) to 416(h), but she overlooks that 416(h) provides the crucial link:  It requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for 416(h) purposes, but for purposes of this subchapter, which includes both 402(d) and 416(e).  Having explicitly complemented 416(e) by the definitional provisions contained in 416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in 416(e).
			

				
				
				The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status, including an applicants status as a wife, widow, husband, or widower.  See, e.g., 416(b), (h)(1)(A).  The Act also sets duration-of-relationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 

422 U.S. 749
782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.  In contrast, no time constraint attends the Third Circuits ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits, no matter the length of time between the fathers death and the childs conception and birth. 
			

				
				
				Because a child who may take from a fathers estate is more likely to be dependent during the parents life and at his death, Mathews v. Lucas, 

427 U.S. 495
, reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a child serves the Acts driving objective, which is to provide ... dependent members of [a wage earners] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insureds] earnings, Califano v. Jobst, 

434 U.S. 47
.  Although the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows, as respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a 416(h) criterion.  Respondent charges that the SSAs construction of the Act raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause.  But under rational-basis review, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress easily passes inspection.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				(c)Because the SSAs interpretation of the relevant provisions, is at least reasonable, the agencys reading is entitled to this Courts deference under Chevron, 

467 U.S. 837
.  Chevron deference is appropriate when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.  United States v. Mead Corp., 

533 U.S. 218
227.  Here, the SSAs longstanding interpretation, set forth in regulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is neither arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.  Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  It therefore warrants the Courts approbation.  Pp.1516.

			Respondent gave birth to twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using her deceased husband's frozen sperm. Respondent applied for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins, relying on 42 U.S.C. 416(e) of the Social Security Act, which defined child to mean, inter alia, ""the child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individual."" The Social Security Administration (SSA), however, identified subsequent provisions of the Act, sections 416(h)(2) and (h)(3)(C), as critical, and read them to entitle biological children to benefits only if they qualified for inheritance from the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfied one of the statutory alternatives to that requirement. The Court concluded that the SSA's reading was better attuned to the statute's text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime. And even if the SSA's longstanding interpretation was not the only reasonable one, it was at least a permissible construction that garnered the Court's respect under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.

				HALL et ux. v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10875.Argued November 29, 2011Decided May 14, 2012
			

				Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan.  The plan must provide for full payment of priority claims.  

11 U.S.C. 1222(a)(2).  Under 1222(a)(2)(A), however, certain governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of priority status and downgraded to general, unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less than full payment.  That exception applies only to claims entitled to priority under [

11 U.S.C. 507] in the first place.  As relevant here, 507(a)(2) covers administrative expenses allowed under 503(b), which includes any tax ... incurred by the estate.  503(b)(B)(i).
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their farm.  They proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from the sale.  Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance being discharged.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.  The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 U.S.C. 1398, 1399, it does not incur postpetition federal income taxes.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the tax was not incurred by the estate under 503(b), it was not a priority claim eligible for the 1222(a)(2)(A) exception.
			

				Held:The federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners postpetition farm sale is not incurred by the estate under 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the Chapter 12 plan.  Pp.417.
			

				
				
				(a)The phrase incurred by the estate bears a plain and natural reading.  A tax incurred by the estate is a tax for which the estate itself is liable.  Only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes.  IRC 1398 and 1399 define the division of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis.  Under those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a separately taxable entity.  The debtornot the trusteeis generally liable for taxes and files the only tax return.  The postpetition income taxes are thus not incurred by the estate.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(b)Section 346 of the Bankruptcy Code and its longstanding interplay with IRC 1398 and 1399 reinforce that whether an estate incurs taxes turns on Congress chapter-specific guidance on which estates are separately taxable.  The original 346 established that state or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, and only on the debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Congress applied the framework of 346 to federal taxes two years later: IRC 1398 and 1399 established that the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases, and not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter 12) cases.  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 subsequently amended 346, expressly aligning its assignment of state or local taxes with the IRC separate taxable entity rules for federal taxes.  This Court assumes that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the existing law at the enactment of 1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estates liability for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(c)Chapter 13, on which Chapter 12 was modeled, further bolsters this Courts holding.  Established understandings hold that postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the [Chapter 13] estate under 503(b) because they are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone.  The Government has also long hewed to this position.  Section 1305(a)(1), which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case, would be superfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collectible inside the bankruptcy.  It is thus clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and are not administrative expenses under 503(b).  To hold otherwise in Chapter 12 would disrupt settled practices in Chapter 13 cases.  Pp.912.
			

				
				
				(d)None of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent overcomes the statutes plain language, context, and structure.  There is no textual basis for giving incurred by the estate a temporal meaning, such that it refers to all taxes incurred postpetition.  Nor does the text support deeming a tax incurred by the estate whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate.  Section 503s legislative history is not inconsistent with this Courts holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.  See Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  Meanwhile, any cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors, which Congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne by a separate taxable entitys trustee.  Finally, petitioners contend that the purpose of 1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts.  There may be compelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable.  But if Congress intended petitioners result, it did not so provide in the statute.  Pp.1217.

				No. 11139.Argued January 17, 2012Decided April 25, 2012
			

				Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency against a tax- payer within 3 years after the return was filed, 

26 U.S.C. 6501(a), but that period is extended to 6 years when a taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return, 6501(e)(1)(A).  Respondent taxpayers overstated the basis of certain property that they had sold.  As a result, their returns understated the gross income they received from the sale by an amount in excess of 25%.  The Commissioner asserted the deficiency outside the 3-year limitations period but within the 6-year period.  The Fourth Circuit concluded that the taxpayers overstatements of basis, and resulting understatements of gross income, did not trigger the extended limitations period.

The Court recognized that such an overstatement wrongly understates a taxpayers income, but concluded that the phrase omits ... an amount limited the statutes scope to situations in which specific receipts are left out of the computation of gross income.  The Court also noted that while the statutes language was not unambiguous, id., at 33, the statutory history showed that Congress intended to restrict the extended limitations period to situations that did not include overstatements of basis.  Finally, the Court found its conclusion in harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501(e)(1)(A), id., at 37, the provision enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and applicable here.

Section 6501(e)(1)(A). At issue was whether this latter provision applied when the taxpayer overstated his basis in property that he has sold, thereby understating the gain that he received from the sale.

				WOOD v. MILYARD, WARDEN, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 109995.Argued February 27, 2012Decided April 24, 2012
			

				In 1987, petitioner Patrick Wood was convicted of murder and other crimes by a Colorado court and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Wood filed a federal habeas petition in 2008.  After receiving Woods petition, the U.S. District Court asked the State if it planned to argue that the petition was untimely.  In response, the State twice informed the District Court that it would not challenge, but [was] not conceding, the timeliness of Woods petition.  Thereafter, the District Court rejected Woods claims on the merits.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief both the merits and the timeliness of Woods petition.  After briefing, the court held the petition time barred, concluding that the court had authority to raise timeliness on its own motion, and that the State had not taken the issue off the table by declining to raise a statute of limitations defense in the District Court.
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.Courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authoritythough not the obligationto raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative in exceptional cases.  Pp.49.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is forfeited if not raised in a defendants answer or in an amendment thereto.  Day v. McDonough, 

547 U.S. 198
.  An affirmative defense, once forfeited, is excluded from the case and, as a rule, cannot be asserted on appeal.
			

				
				
				In Granberry v. Greer, 

481 U.S. 129
, this Court recognized a modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited defense.  There, the Seventh Circuit addressed a nonexhaustion defense the State raised for the first time on appeal.  The exhaustion doctrine, this Court noted, is founded on concerns broader than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respectful, harmonious relations between the state and federal judiciaries.  Id., at 133135.  With that comity interest in mind, the Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a nonexhaustion argument inadvertently overlooked by the State in the district court.  Id. at 132, 134.
			

				
				
				In Day, the Court affirmed a federal district courts authority to consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances so warrant.  547 U.S., at 201.  The State in Day, having miscalculated a time span, erroneously informed the District Court that Days habeas petition was timely.  Apprised of the error by a Magistrate Judge, the District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition as untimely.  This Court affirmed, holding that district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to consider, suasponte, the timeliness of a state prisoners habeas petition.  Id., at 209.  Such leeway was appropriate, the Court again reasoned, because AEDPAs statute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, implicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.  Id., at 205.
			

				
				
				The Court clarified, however, that a federal court does not have carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation.  See Greenlaw v. United States, 

554 U.S. 237
244.  It would be an abuse of discretion for a court to override a States deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.  Day, 547 U.S., at 202.  In Day itself, the States timeliness concession resulted from inadvertent error, id., at 211, not a deliberate decision to proceed to the merits.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Consistent with Granberry and Day, the Court declines to adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense.  The institutional interests served by AEDPAs statute of limitations are also present when a habeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense.  P.9.
			

				
				
				2.The Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed Woods petition as untimely.  In the District Court, the State was well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it, and of the arguments that could be made in support of that defense.  Yet, the State twice informed the District Court that it would not challenge the timeliness of Woods petition.  In so doing, the State deliberately waived the statute of limitations defense.  In light of that waiver, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Courts lead and decided the merits of Woods petition.  Pp.911.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE v. HYATT
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 101219.Argued January 9, 2012Decided April 18, 2012
			

				Under the Patent Act of 1952, if a Patent and Trade Office (PTO) examiner denies a patent application, 

35 U.S.C. 131, the applicant may file an administrative appeal with the PTOs Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, 134.  If the Board also denies the application, the applicant may appeal directly to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under 141.  Alternatively, the applicant may file a civil action against the PTO Director under 145, which permits the applicant to present evidence that was not presented to the PTO.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Hyatt filed a patent application covering multiple claims.  The patent examiner denied all of the claims for lack of an adequate written description.  Hyatt appealed to the Board, which approved some claims but denied others.  Pursuant to 145, Hyatt filed a civil action against the Director, but the District Court declined to consider Hyatts newly proffered written declaration in support of the adequacy of his description, thus limiting its review to the administrative record.  Applying the deferential substantial evidence standard of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to the PTOs factual findings, the court granted summary judgment to the Director.  On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that patent applicants can introduce new evidence in 145 proceedings, subject only to the limitations in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It also reaffirmed its precedent that when new, conflicting evidence is introduced, the district court must make de novo findings to take such evidence into account.
			

				Held:There are no limitations on a patent applicants ability to introduce new evidence in a 145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  If new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact, the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the PTO.  Pp.514.
			

				
				
				(a)Section 145, by its express terms, neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of review for PTO factual findings.  Nonetheless, the Director contends that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and impose a deferential standard of review in 145 proceedings.  As the Director concedes, however, judicial review in 145 proceedings is not limited to the administrative record because the district court may consider new evidence.  If it does so, the district court must act as a factfinder and cannot apply the APAs deferential standard to PTO factual findings when those findings are contradicted by new evidence.  Moreover, the doctrine of administrative exhaustionthe primary purpose of which is the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process, McKart v. United States, 

395 U.S. 185
does not apply because the PTO process is complete by the time a 145 proceeding occurs.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				(b)The core language of the 1870 Patent Act, codified as Revised Statute 4915 (R.S. 4915), remains largely unchanged in 145.  Decisions interpreting R.S. 4915 thus inform this Courts understanding of 145.  Both Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 

112 U.S. 50
, and Morgan v. Daniels, 

153 U.S. 120
, describe the nature of R.S. 4915 proceedings, but the two opinions can be perceived as being in some tension.  Butterworth described the proceeding as an original civil action seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application, while Morgan described it as a suit for judicial review of agency action under a deferential standard.  The cases are distinguishable, however, because they addressed different circumstances.  Butterworth discussed a patent applicants challenge to the denial of his application, whereas Morgan involved an interference proceeding that would now be governed by 146, not 145, and in which no new evidence was presented.  Here, this Court is concerned only with a 145 proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the District Court, so Butterworth guides this Courts decision.  Thus, a district court conducting a 145 proceeding may consider all competent evidence adduced and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the PTO.  The introduction of new evidence in 145 proceedings is subject only to the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and if new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed factual question, de novo findings by the district court will be necessary for that new evidence to be taken into account along with the evidence before the Board.  Pp.713.
			

				
				
				(c)The district court may, however, consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the newly proffered evidence before the PTO in deciding what weight to afford that evidence.  Pp.1314.
			

				625 F.3d 1320, affirmed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Soto- mayor, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Breyer, J., joined.

				MOHAMAD, individually and for ESTATE OF RAHIM, DECEASED, etal.  v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
			

				No. 1188.Argued February 28, 2012Decided April 18, 2012
			

				While visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence officers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed.  Rahims relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action against [a]n individual for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation.  

106Stat.
73, note following 

28 U.S.C. 1350.  The District Court dismissed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPAs authorization of suit against [a]n individual extended liability only to natural persons.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:As used in the TVPA, the term individual encompasses only natural persons.  Consequently, the Act does not impose liability against organizations.  Pp.211.
			

				
				
				(a)The ordinary, everyday meaning of individual refers to a human being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course does not employ the word any differently.  The Dictionary Act defines person to include certain artificial entities as well as individuals, 

1 U.S.C. 1, thereby marking individual as distinct from artificial entities.  Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an individual and an organizational entity.  See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. 92(k), 511.  And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined person in a separate Act to include any individual or entity.  

18 U.S.C. 2331(3).  Pp.25.
			

				
				
				(b)Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some indication that it intended such a result.  There are no such indications in the TVPA.  To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons alone.  The Acts liability provision uses the word individual five times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four times to refer to the victim.  See TVPA 2(a).  Since only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult to conclude that Congress used individual four times in the same sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsovereign organization.  In addition, the TVPA holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.  See TVPA 2(a)(2).  Persons often has a broader meaning in the law than individual, and frequently includes non-natural persons.  Construing individual in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits Congress use of disparate terms.  Pp.56.  
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners counterarguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.611.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioners dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires this Courts result.  First, they rely on definitions that frame individual in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of oneness, but these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.  Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of other nations.  But while Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles, Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 

501 U.S. 104
, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to subject organizations to liability.  Petitioners next argue that the TVPAs scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing.  But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs the term individual, as the TVPA, to describe the covered defendant.  Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their broad reading of individual, but reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of the statutes unambiguous language.  Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  In any event, the history supports this Courts interpretation.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Finally, petitioners argue that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives.  This purposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of the plain text.  Moreover, Congress appeared well aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the TVPA.  Pp.1011.
			

				634 F.3d 604, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined except as to Part IIIB.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.

				(a)The ordinary, everyday meaning of individual refers to a human being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course does not employ the word any differently.  The Dictionary Act defines person to include certain artificial entities as well as individuals, 

1 U.S.C. 1, thereby marking individual as distinct from artificial entities.  Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an individual and an organizational entity.  See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. 92(k), 511.  And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined person in a separate Act to include any individual or entity.  

18 U.S.C. 2331(3).  Pp.25.
			

				
				
				(b)Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some indication that it intended such a result.  There are no such indications in the TVPA.  To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons alone.  The Acts liability provision uses the word individual five times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four times to refer to the victim.  See TVPA 2(a).  Since only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult to conclude that Congress used individual four times in the same sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsovereign organization.  In addition, the TVPA holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.  See TVPA 2(a)(2).  Persons often has a broader meaning in the law than individual, and frequently includes non-natural persons.  Construing individual in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits Congress use of disparate terms.  Pp.56.  
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners counterarguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.611.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioners dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires this Courts result.  First, they rely on definitions that frame individual in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of oneness, but these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.  Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of other nations.  But while Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles, Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 

501 U.S. 104
, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to subject organizations to liability.  Petitioners next argue that the TVPAs scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing.  But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs the term individual, as the TVPA, to describe the covered defendant.  Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their broad reading of individual, but reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of the statutes unambiguous language.  Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  In any event, the history supports this Courts interpretation.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Finally, petitioners argue that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives.  This purposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of the plain text.  Moreover, Congress appeared well aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the TVPA.  Pp.1011.
			

				634 F.3d 604, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined except as to Part IIIB.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.

			Petitioners sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorized a cause of action against ""[a]n individual"" for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation. The district court dismissed the suit, concluding that the TVPA's authorization of suit against ""[a]n individual"" extended liability only to natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed. The Court held that, as used in the TVPA, the term ""individual"" encompassed only  natural persons. Consequently, the TVPA did not impose liability against organizations. Therefore, the Court affirmed the judgment of the lower courts.

				FILARSKY v. DELIA
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101018.Argued January 17, 2012Decided April 17, 2012
			

				Respondent Delia, a firefighter employed by the City of Rialto, California, missed work after becoming ill on the job.  Suspicious of Delias extended absence, the City hired a private investigation firm to conduct surveillance on him.  When Delia was seen buying fiberglass insulation and other building supplies, the City initiated an internal affairs investigation.  It hired petitioner Filarsky, a private attorney, to interview Delia.  At the interview, which Delias attorney and two fire department officials also attended, Delia acknowledged buying the supplies, but denied having done any work on his home.  To verify Delias claim, Filarsky asked Delia to allow a fire department official to enter his home and view the unused materials.  When Delia refused, Filarsky ordered him to bring the materials out of his home for the official to see.  This prompted Delias attorney to threaten a civil rights action against the City and Filarsky.  Nonetheless, after the interview concluded, officials followed Delia to his home, where he produced the materials.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Delia brought an action under 

42 U.S.C. 1983 against the City, the Fire Department, Filarsky, and other individuals, alleging that the order to produce the building materials violated his Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed with respect to all individual defendants except Filarsky, concluding that he was not entitled to seek qualified immunity because he was a private attorney, not a City employee.
			

				Held:A private individual temporarily retained by the government to carry out its work is entitled to seek qualified immunity from suit under 1983.  Pp. 416.
			

				
				
				(a)In determining whether the Court of Appeals made a valid distinction between City employees and Filarsky for qualified immunity purposes, this Court looks to the general principles of tort immunities and defenses applicable at common law, and the reasons the Court has afforded protection from suit under 1983.  See Imbler v. Pachtman, 

424 U.S. 409
.  The common law as it existed in 1871, when Congress enacted 1983, did not draw a distinction between full-time public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in according protection to those carrying out government responsibilities.  Government at that time was smaller in both size and reach, had fewer responsibilities, and operated primarily at the local level.  Government work was carried out to a significant extent by individ- uals who did not devote all their time to public duties, but instead pur- sued private callings as well.  In according protection from suit to individuals doing the governments work, the common law did not draw distinctions based on the nature of a workers engagement with the government.  Indeed, examples of individuals receiving immunity for actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself.  Common law principles of immunity were incorporated into 1983 and should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent.  See Pulliam v. Allen, 

466 U.S. 522
.  Immunity under 1983 therefore should not vary depending on whether an individual working for the government does so as a permanent or full-time employee, or on some other basis.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				(b)Nothing about the reasons this Court has given for recognizing immunity under 1983 counsels against carrying forward the common law rule.  First, the government interest in avoiding unwarranted timidity on the part of those engaged in the publics business which has been called the most important special government immunity-producing concern, Richardson v. McKnight, 

521 U.S. 399
is equally implicated regardless of whether the individual sued as a state actor works for the government full-time or on some other basis.  Second, affording immunity to those acting on the governments behalf serves to ensure that talented candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.  Id., at 408.  The government, in need of specialized knowledge or expertise, may look outside its permanent workforce to secure the services of private individuals.  But because those individuals are free to choose other work that would not expose them to liability for government actions, the most talented candidates might decline public engagements if they did not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public employee counterparts.  Third, the public interest in ensuring performance of government duties free from the distractions that can accompany lawsuits is implicated whether those duties are discharged by private individuals or permanent government employees.  Finally, distinguishing among those who carry out the publics business based on their particular relationship with the government creates significant line-drawing problems and can deprive state actors of the ability to reasonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages, Anderson v. Creighton, 

483 U.S. 635
.  Pp. 1113.
			

				
				
				(c)This conclusion is not contrary to Wyatt v. Cole, 

504 U.S. 158
, or Richardson v. McKnight, 

521 U.S. 399
.  Wyatt did not implicate the reasons underlying recognition of qualified immunity because the defendant in that case had no connection to government and pursued purely private ends.  Richardson involved the unusual circumstances of prison guards employed by a private company who worked in a privately run prison facility.  Nothing of the sort is involved here, or in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist in carrying out its work.  Pp.1315.
			

				621 F.3d 1069, reversed.
			

				
				
				Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Ginsburg, J., and Sotomayor, J., filed concurring opinions.

The Ninth Circuit concluded that the attorney the City hired was not entitled to seek qualified immunity because he was a private attorney, not a City employee.

				CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD., etal. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 10844.Argued December 5, 2011Decided April 17, 2012
			

				The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling of prescription drugs.  A brand-name drug manufacturer seeking FDA approval for a drug submits a new drug application (NDA) containing, among other things, a statement of the drugs components and proposed labeling describing the uses for which the drug may be marketed.  See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1), (d).  Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturers drug, another company may seek permission to market a generic version by filing an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).  See 355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv).  But the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that would infringe a brand manufacturers patent.  To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments require a brand manufacturer to submit its patent numbers and expiration dates, 355(b)(1); and FDA regulations require a description of any method-of-use patent, known as a use code, see 21 CFR 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e).  The FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply.  Instead, it simply publishes the codes, patent numbers, and expiration dates in a large volume known as the Orange Book.
			

				
				
				
				
				After consulting the Orange Book, an ANDA applicant enters one of several certifications to assure the FDA that its generic drug will not infringe the brands patent.  If the patent has not expired, an applicant may fulfill this requirement in one of two ways.  First, it may submit a so-called section viii statement asserting that it will market the drug for only those methods of use not covered by the brands patent, see 

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(viii), and proposing a label that carves out the still-patented method(s) of use, see 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv).  The FDA will not approve an ANDA with a section viii statement if the proposed label overlaps at all with the brands use code.  Second, the ANDA applicant may file a so-called paragraph IV certification stating that the brands patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the [generic drugs] manufacture, use, or sale.  

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV).  Such filing is treated as an act of infringement, giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting in a delay in the generic drugs approval.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a study detailing evidence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent information to the FDA in order to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs.  In response, Congress created a statutory counterclaim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringement.  The provision allows a generic manufacturer to assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand] to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of 

21 U.S.C. 355] on the ground that the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug.  

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).  This case concerns the scope of the counterclaim provision.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture the brand-name version of the diabetes drug repaglinide.  The FDA has approved three uses of the drug, but Novos method-of-use patent claims only one.  Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of the drug for the other two approved methods of use.  Caraco initially filed a paragraph IV certification and, considering this an act of infringement, Novo brought suit.  Caraco then submitted a section viii statement and a proposed label carving out Novos patented therapy.  But before the FDA could approve Caracos ANDA, Novo changed its use code to indicate that it held a patent on all three approved methods of using repaglinide.  Because Caracos proposed label now overlapped with Novos use code, the FDA would not permit Caraco to employ section viii to bring its drug to market.
			

				
				
				
				
				Caraco filed a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement action, seeking an order requiring Novo to correct its use code because the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of using repaglinide.  The District Court granted Caraco summary judgment, but the Federal Circuit reversed.  It read the counterclaims phrase the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug as requiring Caraco to demonstrate that Novos patent does not claim any approved method of use; because the patent covers one approved method, the counterclaim was unavailable.  The court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) of 355.  That information, the court concluded, consists only of the patent number and expiration date expressly required by the statutory provisions.
			

				Held:A generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brands patent as covering a particular method of using a drug.  Pp.1024.
			

				
				
				(a)The parties first dispute the meaning of not an in the phrase the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug.  Novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent claims no approved method of use, but Caraco reads this language to permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particular method that the ANDA applicant seeks to market.  In isolation, either of these readings is plausible, so the meaning of the phrase not an turns on statutory context, see Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  This context favors Caraco: Congress understood that a drug may have multiple methods of use, not all of which a patent covers; and a section viii statement allows the FDA to approve a generic drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market.  The statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.  Within this scheme, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brands assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic company wishes to pursue; the counterclaims availability matches the availability of FDA approval under the statute.  Pp.1115.
			

				
				
				(b)The parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) of 355.  A use code, which is a description of the patent, surely qualifies as patent information.  Novo nonetheless contends that use codes are not submitted under subsections (b) and (c) because those provisions expressly require an NDA applicant to provide only the patent number and the expiration date of any patent claiming the drug or a method of its use.  But 355(b) and (c) also govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the FDA.  The term under is broad enough to include patent information, like use codes, that brands submit as required by this scheme.  This reading draws support from the Courts prior decisions in e.g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 

496 U.S. 661
668, and Ardestani v. INS, 

502 U.S. 129
; and it is bolstered by Congresss use of the narrower phrases described in and prescribed by in neighboring provisions.  See 355(c)(2), (d)(6).  Again, the conclusion that use codes are submitted under 355(b) and (c) fits the broader statutory context.  Use codes are pivotal to the FDAs implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and so it is unsurprising that the counterclaim provisions language sweeps widely enough to embrace them.  Pp.1518.
			

				
				
				(c)The counterclaim provisions description of available remedies dispatches whatever remains of Novos arguments.  The Courts reading gives content to both remedies: It delete[s] a listing from the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and correct[s] the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patents scope.  By contrast, Novos interpretation would all but read correct out of the statute.  If, as Novo contends, the counterclaim is available only where the patent claims no approved method of use, the remedy will always be to delete the patent information.  And if the counterclaim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates, the Orange Book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction.  Pp.1820.
			

				
				
				(d)Novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaims drafting history, but neither overcomes the statutory text and context.  The company first points out that Congress failed to pass an earlier bill that would have required brands to file descriptions of method-of-use patents and would have allowed generic companies to bring civil actions to delete or correct the information filed.  Because that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, Novo contends that this Court cannot read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the same.  But the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have caused its failure.  And the limited criticism of its mechanism for challenging brands descriptions of their patents focused on the creation of an independent cause of actionstronger medicine than the counterclaim at issue here.  Finally, between that bills demise and the counterclaims enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring brands to supply use codes.  The counterclaim provisions drafters thus had no need to require this information.
			

				
				
				Novo next contends that Congress established the counterclaim only to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the Orange Booka problem that had come to light when the Federal Circuit held in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F.3d 1323, that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent.  Novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provision.  But this Court thinks Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem: that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands patent listings, and that the FDA therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market.  Again, the proof of that lies in the statute itselfits text and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is baseless, but also (as here) when it is overbroad.  Moreover, Congresss equation of the two situations makes perfect sense.  In either case, the brand submits misleading patent information to the FDA, delaying or blocking approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent and thus, under the statute, should go to market.  Pp.2024.

Second, the ANDA applicant may file a so-called paragraph IV certification stating that the brands patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the [generic drugs] manufacture, use, or sale.  

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV).  Such filing is treated as an act of infringement, giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting in a delay in the generic drugs approval.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a study detailing evidence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent information to the FDA in order to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs.  In response, Congress created a statutory counterclaim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringement.  The provision allows a generic manufacturer to assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand] to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of 

21 U.S.C. 355] on the ground that the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug.  

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).  This case concerns the scope of the counterclaim provision.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture the brand-name version of the diabetes drug repaglinide.  The FDA has approved three uses of the drug, but Novos method-of-use patent claims only one.  Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of the drug for the other two approved methods of use.  Caraco initially filed a paragraph IV certification and, considering this an act of infringement, Novo brought suit.  Caraco then submitted a section viii statement and a proposed label carving out Novos patented therapy.  But before the FDA could approve Caracos ANDA, Novo changed its use code to indicate that it held a patent on all three approved methods of using repaglinide.  Because Caracos proposed label now overlapped with Novos use code, the FDA would not permit Caraco to employ section viii to bring its drug to market.
			

				
				
				
				
				Caraco filed a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement action, seeking an order requiring Novo to correct its use code because the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of using repaglinide.  The District Court granted Caraco summary judgment, but the Federal Circuit reversed.  It read the counterclaims phrase the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug as requiring Caraco to demonstrate that Novos patent does not claim any approved method of use; because the patent covers one approved method, the counterclaim was unavailable.  The court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) of 355.  That information, the court concluded, consists only of the patent number and expiration date expressly required by the statutory provisions.
			

				Held:A generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brands patent as covering a particular method of using a drug.  Pp.1024.
			

				
				
				(a)The parties first dispute the meaning of not an in the phrase the patent does not claim ... an approved method of using the drug.  Novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent claims no approved method of use, but Caraco reads this language to permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particular method that the ANDA applicant seeks to market.  In isolation, either of these readings is plausible, so the meaning of the phrase not an turns on statutory context, see Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  This context favors Caraco: Congress understood that a drug may have multiple methods of use, not all of which a patent covers; and a section viii statement allows the FDA to approve a generic drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market.  The statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.  Within this scheme, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brands assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic company wishes to pursue; the counterclaims availability matches the availability of FDA approval under the statute.  Pp.1115.
			

				
				
				(b)The parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) of 355.  A use code, which is a description of the patent, surely qualifies as patent information.  Novo nonetheless contends that use codes are not submitted under subsections (b) and (c) because those provisions expressly require an NDA applicant to provide only the patent number and the expiration date of any patent claiming the drug or a method of its use.  But 355(b) and (c) also govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the FDA.  The term under is broad enough to include patent information, like use codes, that brands submit as required by this scheme.  This reading draws support from the Courts prior decisions in e.g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 

496 U.S. 661
668, and Ardestani v. INS, 

502 U.S. 129
; and it is bolstered by Congresss use of the narrower phrases described in and prescribed by in neighboring provisions.  See 355(c)(2), (d)(6).  Again, the conclusion that use codes are submitted under 355(b) and (c) fits the broader statutory context.  Use codes are pivotal to the FDAs implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and so it is unsurprising that the counterclaim provisions language sweeps widely enough to embrace them.  Pp.1518.
			

				
				
				(c)The counterclaim provisions description of available remedies dispatches whatever remains of Novos arguments.  The Courts reading gives content to both remedies: It delete[s] a listing from the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and correct[s] the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patents scope.  By contrast, Novos interpretation would all but read correct out of the statute.  If, as Novo contends, the counterclaim is available only where the patent claims no approved method of use, the remedy will always be to delete the patent information.  And if the counterclaim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates, the Orange Book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction.  Pp.1820.
			

				
				
				(d)Novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaims drafting history, but neither overcomes the statutory text and context.  The company first points out that Congress failed to pass an earlier bill that would have required brands to file descriptions of method-of-use patents and would have allowed generic companies to bring civil actions to delete or correct the information filed.  Because that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, Novo contends that this Court cannot read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the same.  But the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have caused its failure.  And the limited criticism of its mechanism for challenging brands descriptions of their patents focused on the creation of an independent cause of actionstronger medicine than the counterclaim at issue here.  Finally, between that bills demise and the counterclaims enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring brands to supply use codes.  The counterclaim provisions drafters thus had no need to require this information.
			

				
				
				Novo next contends that Congress established the counterclaim only to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the Orange Booka problem that had come to light when the Federal Circuit held in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F.3d 1323, that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent.  Novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provision.  But this Court thinks Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem: that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands patent listings, and that the FDA therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market.  Again, the proof of that lies in the statute itselfits text and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is baseless, but also (as here) when it is overbroad.  Moreover, Congresss equation of the two situations makes perfect sense.  In either case, the brand submits misleading patent information to the FDA, delaying or blocking approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent and thus, under the statute, should go to market.  Pp.2024.
			

				601 F.3d 1359, reversed and remanded.

			"|"
			Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer's drug, another company could seek permission to market a generic version pursuant to legislation known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. See Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585. The relevant statute at issue in this case provided that a generic company ""may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand manufacturer] to correct or delete the patent information [it] submitted... under [two statutory subsections] on the ground that the patent does not claim... an approved method of using the drug."" 117 Stat. 2452, 21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). At issue in this case was whether Congress had authorized a generic company to challenge a use code's accuracy by bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufacturer in a patent infringement suit. The Court held that a generic manufacturer could employ this provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately described the brand's patent as covering a particular method of using the drug in question. Therefore, the Court reversed the judgment of the Federal Circuit.

				REHBERG v. PAULK
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 10788.Argued November 1, 2011Decided April 2, 2012
			

				Respondent, the chief investigator for a district attorneys office, testified at grand jury proceedings that resulted in petitioners indictment.  After the indictments were dismissed, petitioner brought an action under 

42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that respondent had conspired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury.  The Federal District Court denied respondents motion to dismiss on immunity grounds, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that respondent had absolute immunity from a 1983 claim based on his grand jury testimony.
			

				Held:A witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same absolute immunity from suit under 1983 as a witness who testifies at trial.  Pp. 318.
			

				
				
				(a)Section 1983, which derives from 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort law and the common-law immunities applicable in tort suits.  See, e.g., Burns v. Reed, 

500 U.S. 478
.  This interpretation of 1983 has been reaffirmed by the Court time and again.  Thus, the Court looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the immunities available in actions brought under 1983.  See Kalina v. Fletcher, 

522 U.S. 118
.  Taking a functional approach, see, e.g., Forrester v. White, 

484 U.S. 219
, the Court identifies those governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are performed with independence and without fear of consequences, Pierson v. Ray, 

386 U.S. 547
.  
			

				
				
				The Courts functional approach is tied to the common laws identification of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity, but the Courts precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to protect those functions.  For example, it was common in 1871 for cases to be prosecuted by private parties, who did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit.  But as the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials, common-law courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert.  This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to private, prosecutors.  Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under 1983 reached this Court in Imbler v. Pachtman, 

424 U.S. 409
, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead relied substantially on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for common-law torts.  Neither has the Court suggested that 1983 is simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims.  The new federal claim created by 1983 differs in important ways from pre-existing common-law torts.  Accordingly, both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in 1983 actions differ in some respects from the common law.  Pp. 39.
			

				
				
				(b)A trial witness sued under 1983 enjoys absolute immunity from any claim based on his testimony.  Briscoe v. LaHue, 

460 U.S. 352
.  Without absolute immunity, the truth-seeking process would be impaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify, and even a witness who took the stand might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff for fear of subsequent liability.  Id., at 333.  These factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.  In both contexts, a witness fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.  And in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony because other sanctions, chiefly prosecution for perjury, provide a sufficient deterrent.
			

				
				
				For the reasons identified in Briscoe, supra, at 342344, there is no reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses in 1983 actions.  And the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any 1983 claim based on the witness testimony may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony, or by using evidence of the witness testimony to support any other 1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution.  Were it otherwise, a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the preparatory activitysuch as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the substance of his intended testimonyrather than the absolutely immune actions themselves.  Pp. 912.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners main argument is that under Malley v. Briggs, 

475 U.S. 335
341, and Kalina v. Fletcher, 

522 U.S. 118
, grand jury witnesses who are complaining witnesses are not entitled to absolute immunity.  But at the time 1983s predecessor was enacted, a complaining witness was a party who procured an arrest and initiated a criminal prosecution.  A complaining witness might testify, either before a grand jury or at trial, but testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a complaining witness.  Thus, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive function performed by a complaining witness.  A complaining witness cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testimony, see Briscoe, 460 U.S., at 326, and there is no more reason why a complaining witness should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury.  
			

				
				
				Once the distinctive function performed by a complaining witness is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement officer who testifies before a grand jury is not comparable to a complaining witness because it is not the officer who makes the critical decision to press criminal charges, but the prosecutor.  It would be anomalous to permit a police officer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for the decision to initiate a prosecution.  Petitioner also contends that the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury proceedings because trial witnesses face cross-examination.  But the force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allowing such civil actions would createsubversion of grand jury secrecy, which is essential to the proper functioning of the grand jury system.  See United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 

463 U.S. 418
.  And finally, contrary to petitioners suggestion, recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction between States that use grand juries and States that permit felony prosecutions to be brought by complaint or information.  Most States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at which witnesses testify, and the lower courts have held that preliminary hearing witnesses are protected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses.  Pp. 1218.
			

				611 F.3d 828, affirmed.

				FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 10945.Argued October 12, 2011Decided April 2, 2012
			

				Petitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a bench warrant issued for petitioners arrest after he failed to appear at a hearing to enforce a fine.  He was initially detained in the Burlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Correctional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the fine had been paid.  At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed.  Petitioner claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals.  At the second jail, petitioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, armpits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his clothes examined.  Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting.  He filed a 

42 U.S.C. 1983 action in the Federal District Court against the government entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband.  The court granted him summary judgment, ruling that strip-searching nonindictable offenders without reasonable suspicion violates the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  The Third Circuit reversed.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				621 F. 3d 296, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions, and thus the Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro- poses.  Pp.518, 19.
			

				
				
				(a)Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the expertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to problems.  A regulation impinging on an inmates constitutional rights must be upheld if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  Turner v. Safley, 

482 U.S. 78
.  This Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 

441 U.S. 520
, upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional facilities to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution[s], deferring to the judgment of correctional officials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.  In Block v. Rutherford, 

468 U.S. 576
587, the Court upheld a general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling threat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions for certain detainees.  The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 

468 U.S. 517
523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable exceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is concealing a prohibited item.  These cases establish that correctional officials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and that in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters, Block, supra, at 584585.
			

				
				
				Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to be processed at jails.  See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 

532 U.S. 318
.  Pp. 59.
			

				
				
				(b)The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake process.  The admission of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee population, and the new detainees themselves.  Officials therefore must screen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring immediate medical attention.  It may be difficult to identify and treat medical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual inspection.  Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving them reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for signs of gang affiliation as part of the intake process.  Additionally, correctional officials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and other prohibited items new detainees may possess.  Drugs can make inmates aggressive toward officers or each other, and drug trading can lead to violent confrontations.  Contraband has value in a jails culture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods can lead to violence, extortion, and disorder.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners proposalthat new detainees not arrested for serious crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from invasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding contrabandis unworkable.  The seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be difficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.  Even persons arrested for a minor offense may be coerced by others into concealing contraband.  Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and result in more contraband being brought into the detention facility.
			

				
				
				It also may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search.  Jail officials know little at the outset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about his identity.  The officers conducting an initial search often do not have access to criminal history records.  And those records can be inaccurate or incomplete.  Even with accurate information, officers would encounter serious implementation difficulties.  They would be required to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were serious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol.  Other possible classifications based on characteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory application.  To avoid liability, officers might be inclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  While the restrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy of some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders.

Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed framework.  Pp.1318, 19.

				FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 10945.Argued October 12, 2011Decided April 2, 2012
			

				Petitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a bench warrant issued for petitioners arrest after he failed to appear at a hearing to enforce a fine.  He was initially detained in the Burlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Correctional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the fine had been paid.  At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed.  Petitioner claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals.  At the second jail, petitioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, armpits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his clothes examined.  Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting.  He filed a 

42 U.S.C. 1983 action in the Federal District Court against the government entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband.  The court granted him summary judgment, ruling that strip-searching nonindictable offenders without reasonable suspicion violates the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  The Third Circuit reversed.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				621 F. 3d 296, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions, and thus the Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro- poses.  Pp.518, 19.
			

				
				
				(a)Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the expertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to problems.  A regulation impinging on an inmates constitutional rights must be upheld if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  Turner v. Safley, 

482 U.S. 78
.  This Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 

441 U.S. 520
, upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional facilities to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution[s], deferring to the judgment of correctional officials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.  In Block v. Rutherford, 

468 U.S. 576
587, the Court upheld a general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling threat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions for certain detainees.  The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 

468 U.S. 517
523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable exceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is concealing a prohibited item.  These cases establish that correctional officials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and that in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters, Block, supra, at 584585.
			

				
				
				Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to be processed at jails.  See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 

532 U.S. 318
.  Pp. 59.
			

				
				
				(b)The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake process.  The admission of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee population, and the new detainees themselves.  Officials therefore must screen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring immediate medical attention.  It may be difficult to identify and treat medical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual inspection.  Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving them reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for signs of gang affiliation as part of the intake process.  Additionally, correctional officials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and other prohibited items new detainees may possess.  Drugs can make inmates aggressive toward officers or each other, and drug trading can lead to violent confrontations.  Contraband has value in a jails culture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods can lead to violence, extortion, and disorder.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners proposalthat new detainees not arrested for serious crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from invasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding contrabandis unworkable.  The seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be difficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.  Even persons arrested for a minor offense may be coerced by others into concealing contraband.  Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and result in more contraband being brought into the detention facility.
			

				
				
				It also may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search.  Jail officials know little at the outset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about his identity.  The officers conducting an initial search often do not have access to criminal history records.  And those records can be inaccurate or incomplete.  Even with accurate information, officers would encounter serious implementation difficulties.  They would be required to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were serious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol.  Other possible classifications based on characteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory application.  To avoid liability, officers might be inclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  While the restrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy of some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders.  The Fourth and 
 
Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed framework.  Pp.1318, 19.

				FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION etal. v. COOPER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101024.Argued November 30, 2011Decided March 28, 2012
			

				Respondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical certificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with HIV.  Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the basis of his HIV status.  Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding information about his condition.  The Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAAs parent agency, launched a joint criminal investigation with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA certifications.  The DOT provided the SSA with the names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had also received disability benefits.  Respondents name appeared on the spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the FAA.  His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for making false statements to a Government agency.  He pleaded guilty and was fined and sentenced to probation.  He then filed suit, alleging that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of records held by Executive Branch agencies.  The Act allows an aggrieved individual to sue for actual damages, 

5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(4)(A), if the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Acts requirements in such a way as to adversely affect the individual.  Specifically, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his confidential medical information had caused him mental and emotional distress.  The District Court concluded that the Government had violated the Act.  But, finding the term actual damages ambiguous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which provides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in the Governments favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the recovery of nonpecuniary damages.  Reversing the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded that actual damages in the Act is not ambiguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.
			

				Held:The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Governments sovereign immunity from liability for such harms.  Pp.419.
			

				
				
				(a)A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Pea, 

518 U.S. 187
, and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, 

514 U.S. 527
.  Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money damages against the Government.  United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 

503 U.S. 30
.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)The term actual damages in the Privacy Act is a legal term of art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken, Molzof v. United States, 

502 U.S. 301
.  Even as a legal term, the precise meaning of actual damages is far from clear.  Although the term is sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary harm.  Because of the terms chameleon-like quality, it must be considered in the particular context in which it appears.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(c)The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by defamation and privacy torts.  Its remedial provision, under which plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove at least some actual damages, parallels the common-law torts of libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover general damages if they first prove special damages.  Doe v. Chao, 

540 U.S. 614
.  Special damages are limited to actual pecuniary loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved.  General damages cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved.  This parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term actual damages to mean special damages, thus barring Privacy Act victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pecuniary harm.  That Congress would choose actual damages instead of special damages is not without precedent, as the terms have occasionally been used interchangeably.  Furthermore, any doubt about the plausibility of construing actual damages as special damages in the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress deliberate refusal to allow recovery for general damages.  In common-law defamation and privacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory damages other than general damages.  Because Congress declined to authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the term actual damages in the Act to mean special dam-ages for proven pecuniary loss.  Pp.914.
			

				
				
				(d)Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic loss.  Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court adopts an interpretation of actual damages limited to proven pecuniary harm.  To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly requires.  P.14.
			

				
				
				(e)Respondent raises several counterarguments:(1) common-law cases often define actual damages to mean all compensatory damages; (2) the elimination of general damages from the Privacy Act means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress; (3) because some courts have construed actual damages in similar statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must have intended actual damages in the Act to include mental and emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Acts remedial purpose.  None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immu-nity canon.  Pp.1419.
			

				622 F.3d 1016, reversed and remanded.

				VARTELAS v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 101211.Argued January 18, 2012Decided March 28, 2012
			

				Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States.  Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an entry, upon their return from innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] ... outside this countrys borders.  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 

374 U.S. 449
.  In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures, creating a uniform removal proceeding.  See 8 U.S.C. 1229, 1229a.  Congress made admission the key word, and defined admission to mean the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.  1101(a)(13)(A).  This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti.  Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as seeking admission if they have committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2), 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, a crime involving moral turpitude ... or conspiracy to commit such a crime,  1182(a)(2)(A)(i).
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.  In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRAs passage, Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents.  In 2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking admission based on his 1994 conviction.  At Vartelas removal proceedings, his attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief under former 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece.  The BIA affirmed.  In 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability.  He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRAs new admission provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  The BIA denied the motion.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  Rejecting Vartelas argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.
			

				Held:The impact of Vartelas brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.  Pp.717.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by Vartelas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 

511 U.S. 244
.  The presumption against retroactive legislation embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.  Id., at 265.  Numerous decisions of this Court have invoked Justice Storys formulation for determining when a laws retrospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as relevant here, when such application would attac[h] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, Society for Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767.  See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 

533 U.S. 289
; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 

520 U.S. 939
; Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 283.  Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a new disability, effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, in respect to past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRAs passage.
			

				
				
				Congress did not expressly prescribe 1101(a)(13)s temporal reach.  The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether application of IIRIRAs travel restraint to Vartelas would have retroactive effect Congress did not authorize.  See id., at 280.  Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.  Beyond genuine doubt 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)s restraint on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a new disability.  Once able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe sanction.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  The Government suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States.  But losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members.
			

				
				
				This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 

112 U.S. 536
; St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 321323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous, see Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 280286; Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S., at 946950.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				(b)The Court finds disingenuous the Governments argument that no retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant event is the aliens post-IIRIRA return to the United States.  Vartelas return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for his new disability was his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  That past misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				(c)In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words committed an offense in 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).  It reasoned that reliance on the prior law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and that Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration laws.  This reasoning is doubly flawed.  A party is not required to show reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct.  See, e.g., Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 282, n. 35.  In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.  St. Cyr is illustrative.  There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.  Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.  But his removal proceeding was commenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation.  Disallowance of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct, 533 U.S., at 321.  Aliens like St. Cyr almost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial, id., at 325.  Because applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an obvious and severe retroactive effect, ibid., and Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyrs case.  Vartelas case is at least as clear as St. Cyrs for declining to apply a new law retroactively.  St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney Generals discretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an officials permission, to make short trips to see and assist his parents in Greece.  The Second Circuit compounded its initial misperception of the antiretroactivity principle by holding otherwise.  Fleuti continues to govern Vartelas short-term travel.  Pp.1417.

				VARTELAS v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 101211.Argued January 18, 2012Decided March 28, 2012
			

				Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States.  Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an entry, upon their return from innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] ... outside this countrys borders.  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 

374 U.S. 449
.  In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures, creating a uniform removal proceeding.  See 8 U.S.C. 1229, 1229a.  Congress made admission the key word, and defined admission to mean the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.  1101(a)(13)(A).  This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti.  Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as seeking admission if they have committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2), 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, a crime involving moral turpitude ... or conspiracy to commit such a crime,  1182(a)(2)(A)(i).
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.  In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRAs passage, Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents.  In 2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking admission based on his 1994 conviction.  At Vartelas removal proceedings, his attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief under former 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece.  The BIA affirmed.  In 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability.  He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRAs new admission provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  The BIA denied the motion.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  Rejecting Vartelas argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.
			

				Held:The impact of Vartelas brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.  Pp.717.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by Vartelas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 

511 U.S. 244
.  The presumption against retroactive legislation embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.  Id., at 265.  Numerous decisions of this Court have invoked Justice Storys formulation for determining when a laws retrospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as relevant here, when such application would attac[h] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, Society for Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767.  See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 

533 U.S. 289
; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 

520 U.S. 939
; Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 283.  Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a new disability, effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, in respect to past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRAs passage.
			

				
				
				Congress did not expressly prescribe 1101(a)(13)s temporal reach.  The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether application of IIRIRAs travel restraint to Vartelas would have retroactive effect Congress did not authorize.  See id., at 280.  Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.  Beyond genuine doubt 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)s restraint on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a new disability.  Once able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe sanction.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  The Government suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States.  But losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members.
			

				
				
				This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 

112 U.S. 536
; St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 321323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous, see Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 280286; Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S., at 946950.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				(b)The Court finds disingenuous the Governments argument that no retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant event is the aliens post-IIRIRA return to the United States.  Vartelas return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for his new disability was his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  That past misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				(c)In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words committed an offense in 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).  It reasoned that reliance on the prior law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and that Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration laws.  This reasoning is doubly flawed.  A party is not required to show reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct.  See, e.g., Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 282, n. 35.  In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.  St. Cyr is illustrative.  There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.  Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.  But his removal proceeding was commenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation.  Disallowance of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct, 533 U.S., at 321.  Aliens like St. Cyr almost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial, id., at 325.  Because applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an obvious and severe retroactive effect, ibid., and Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyrs case.  Vartelas case is at least as clear as St. Cyrs for declining to apply a new law retroactively.  St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney Generals discretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an officials permission, to make short trips to see and assist his parents in Greece.  The Second Circuit compounded its initial misperception of the antiretroactivity principle by holding otherwise.  Fleuti continues to govern Vartelas short-term travel.  Pp.1417.

			Petitioner, a native of Greece and a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States, plead guilty to a felony in 1994. Petitioner later traveled to Greece in 2003 to visit his parents and on his return to the United States, he was treated as an inadmissible alien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law governing at the time of petitioner's plea, an alien in his situation could travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his resident alien status, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13). This case presented a question of retroactivity not addressed by Congress: As to an LPR convicted of a crime before the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and 1182(a)(2), which regime governed, the one in force at the time of the conviction, or IIRIRA? Guided by the deeply rooted presumption against retroactive legislation, the Court held that section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) did not apply to petitioner's conviction. The impact of petitioner's brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status was therefore determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction. Accordingly, the Court reversed the judgment of the Second Circuit and remanded for further proceedings.

				SETSER v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 107387.Argued November 30, 2011Decided March 28, 2012
			

				When petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges, the State also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then serving for another drug offense.  At about the same time, Setser pleaded guilty to federal drug charges.  The Federal District Court imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge.  While Setsers federal appeal was pending, the state court sentenced him to 5 years for the probation violation and 10 years for the drug charge, but ordered the sentences to be served concurrently.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed the federal sentence, holding that the District Court had authority to order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and that Setsers sentence was reasonable, even if the state courts decision made it unclear exactly how to administer it.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The District Court had discretion to order that Setsers federal sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the probation violation.  Pp.212.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings, see Oregon v. Ice, 

555 U.S. 160
169.  The statutory text and structure do not foreclose a district courts exercise of this discretion with respect to anticipated state sentences.  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the situation here, since the District Court did not impose multiple terms of imprisonment ... at the same time, and Setser was not already subject to the state sentences at issue, 

18 U.S.C. 3584(a).  This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the District Court lacked authority to act as it did and that the Bureau of Prisons is to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision after the federal sentence has been imposed.  Section 3621(b), from which the Bureau claims to derive this authority, says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences.  And it is more natural to read 3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in situations not covered than it is to read 3621(b) as giving the Bureau what amounts to sentencing authority.  Setsers arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Pp.28.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)None of the other objections raised by Setser and the Government requires a different result.  Pp.812.
			

				
				
				2.The state courts subsequent decision to make the state sentences run concurrently does not establish that the Federal District Court imposed an unreasonable sentence.  The difficulty here arises not from the federal-court sentencewhich is to run concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively with anotherbut from the state courts decision.  Deciding which of the District Courts dispositions should prevail under these circumstances is a problem, but it does not show the District Courts sentence to be unlawful.  The reasonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion, see Gall v. United States, 

552 U.S. 38
, but Setser identifies no flaw in the District Courts decisionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing that the court failed to consider.  Where late-onset facts make it difficult, or even impossible, to implement the sentence, the Bureau of Prisons may determine, in the first instance, how long the District Courts sentence authorizes it to continue Setsers confinement, subject to the potential for judicial review.  Pp.1214.
			

				607 F.3d 128, affirmed.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101261.Argued November 29, 2011Decided March 26, 2012
			

				Under 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who realize profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of the corporations securities within any 6-month period.  The Act provides that such suits must be brought within two years after the date such profit was realized.  

15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2007, respondent Simmonds filed numerous 16(b) actions, claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the late 1990s and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks aftermarket prices, allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sales.  She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with 16(a)s requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests.  That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled 16(b)s 2-year time period.  The District Court dismissed the complaints as untimely.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Citing its decision in Whittaker v. Whittaker Corp., 639 F.2d 516, it held that the limitations period is tolled until an insider files the 16(a) disclosure statement regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.
			

				Held:Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a question on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in determining that it is tolled until a 16(a) statement is filed.  The text of 16(b)which starts the clock from the date such profit was realized, 78p(b)simply does not support the Whittaker rule.  The rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment.  Under long-settled equitable-tolling principles, a litigant must establish (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.  Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 

544 U.S. 408
.  Tolling therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should have been, discovered by the plaintiff.  Allowing tolling to continue beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the general purpose of statutes of limitations: to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.  John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 

552 U.S. 130
.  The Whittaker rules inequity is especially apparent here, where the theory of 16(b) liability is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they had to file a 16(a) statement.  Under the Whittaker rule, alleged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled either to file or to face the prospect of 16(b) litigation in perpetuity.  Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it would have said so.  Simmonds arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  The lower courts should consider in the first instance how usual equitable tolling rules apply in this case.  Pp.48.

				ZIVOTOFSKY, by his parents and guardians, ZIVOTOFSKY et ux. v. CLINTON, SECRETARY  OF STATE
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
			

				No. 10699.Argued November 7, 2011Decided March 26, 2012
			

				Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem.  His mother requested that Zivotofskys place of birth be listed as Israel on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.  That provision states: For purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizens legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.  U.S. officials refused the request, citing a State Department policy that prohibits recording Israel as the place of birth for those born in Jerusalem.  Zivotofskys parents filed a suit on his behalf against the Secretary of State.  The District Court dismissed the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question regarding Jerusalems political status.  The D. C. Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that power cannot be reviewed by the courts.
			

				Held:The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zivotofskys claim.Pp. 512.
			

				
				
				(a)This Court has said that a controversy involves a political question ... where there is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.  Nixon v. United States, 

506 U.S. 224
.  The lower courts ruled that this case presents such a political question because they misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofskys claim would require the Judiciary to define U.S. policy regarding the status of Jerusalem.  In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under 214(d) to choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.  Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise.  Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of 214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional.  There is no textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of that question to another branch:  At least since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is emphatically the province and duty of the Judiciary to determine the constitutionality of a statute.  Nor is there a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question: Both parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textual, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that 214(d) is constitutional.  Pp.512.
			

				
				
				(b)Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case presents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivotofskys claim.  This Court is a court of final review and not first view, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 

534 U.S. 103
, and ordinarily do[es] not decide in the first instance issues not decided below, National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith,

			Petitioner was born in Jerusalem and his mother requested that his place of birth be listed as ""Israel"" on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport pursuant to section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. U.S. officials refused the request and petitioner's parents filed suit on his behalf against the Secretary of State. The district court dismissed, holding that the case presented a nonjusticiable political question and the D.C. Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the Constitution gave the Executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns and that the exercise of that power could not be reviewed by the courts. The Court held that the courts were fully capable of determining whether this statute could be given effect, or instead must be struck down in light of authority conferred on the Executive by the Constitution. The only real question for the courts was whether the statute was constitutional. Having determined that the case was justiciable, the Court left it to the lower courts to consider the merits in the first instance. Accordingly, the Court vacated the judgment of the D.C.

				SACKETT et vir v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101062.Argued January 9, 2012Decided March 21, 2012
			

				The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person, 
33 U.S.C. 1311, without a permit, into navigable waters, 1344.  Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may either issue a compliance order or initiate a civil enforcement action.  1319(a)(3).  The resulting civil penalty may not exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.  1319(d).  The Government contends that the amount doubles to $75,000 when the EPA prevails against a person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Sacketts, petitioners here, received a compliance order from the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable waters and that their construction project violated the Act.  The Sacketts sought declarative and injunctive relief in the Federal District Court, contending that the compliance order was arbitrary [and] capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of due process in violation of the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Clean Water Act precluded pre-enforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such preclusion did not violate due process.
			

				Held:The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge the issuance of the EPAs order.  Pp.410.
			

				
				
				(a)The APA provides for judicial review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.  
5 U.S.C. 704.  The compliance order here has all the hallmarks of APA finality.  Through it, the EPA determined rights or obligations, Bennett v. Spear, 

520 U.S. 154
, requiring the Sacketts to restore their property according to an agency-approved plan and to give the EPA access.  Also, legal consequences ... flow from the order, ibid., which, according to the Governments litigating position, exposes the Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings.  The order also severely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their fill from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 
33 U.S.C. 1344; 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(iv).  Further, the orders issuance marks the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178, for the EPAs findings in the compliance order were not subject to further agency review.  The Sacketts also had no other adequate remedy in a court, 
5 U.S.C. 704.  A civil action brought by the EPA under 
33 U.S.C. 1319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process.  And each day they wait, they accrue additional potential liability.  Applying to the Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for the EPAs action.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)The Clean Water Act is not a statute that preclude[s] judicial review under the APA, 
5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1).  The APA creates a presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.  Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 

467 U.S. 340
.  While this presumption may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole, ibid., the Governments arguments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Acts statutory scheme precludes APA review.  Pp.710.
			

				622 F.3d 1139, reversed and remanded.

The order asserted that petitioners' property was subject to the Act, and that they have violated its provisions by placing fill material on the property; and on this basis it directed them immediately to restore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan. The Court concluded that the compliance order was final agency action for which there was no adequate remedy other than APA review, and that the Act did not preclude that review.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				LAFLER v. COOPER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 10209.Argued October 31, 2011
				
				Decided March 21, 2012
			

				Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses.  The prosecution offered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence on the other two, in exchange for a guilty plea.  In a communication with the court, respondent admitted his guilt and expressed a willingness to accept the offer.  But he rejected the offer, allegedly after his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below the waist.  At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and received a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence.  In a subsequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondents claim that his attorneys advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assistance.  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the ineffective-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial.  Respondent renewed his claim in federal habeas.  Finding that the state appellate court had unreasonably applied the constitutional effective-assistance standards laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
, and Hill v. Lockhart, 

474 U.S. 52
, the District Court granted a conditional writ and ordered specific performance of the original plea offer.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Applying Strickland, it found that counsel had provided deficient performance by advising respondent of an incorrect legal rule, and that respondent suffered prejudice because he lost the opportunity to take the more favorable sentence offered in the plea.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Where counsels ineffective advice led to an offers rejection, and where the prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice, there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offers terms would have been less severe than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed.  Pp.311.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Because the parties agree that counsels performance was deficient, the only question is how to apply Stricklands prejudice test where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial.  Pp.34. 
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)In that context, the Strickland prejudice test requires a defendant to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice.  The Sixth Circuit and other federal appellate courts have agreed with the Strickland prejudice test for rejected pleas adopted here by this Court.  Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a narrow viewthat Strickland prejudice cannot arise from plea bargaining if the defendant is later convicted at a fair trialbut their reasoning is unpersuasive.  First, they claim that the 
 
Sixth Amendments sole purpose is to protect the right to a fair trial, but the Amendment actually requires effective assistance at critical stages of a criminal proceeding, including pretrial stages.  This is consistent with the right to effective assistance on appeal, see, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 

545 U.S. 605
, and the right to counsel during sentencing, see, e.g., Glover v. United States, 

531 U.S. 198
204.  This Court has not followed a rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular error at issue.  See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 

474 U.S. 254
.  Second, this Court has previously rejected petitioners argument that Lockhart v. Fretwell, 

506 U.S. 364
, modified Strickland and does so again here.  Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside, 

475 U.S. 157
, demonstrate that it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate prejudice, Williams v. Taylor, 

529 U.S. 362
392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense strategy outside the law.  Here, however, respondent seeks relief from counsels failure to meet a valid legal standard.  Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction by arguing that the 
 
Sixth Amendments purpose is to ensure a convictions reliability, but this argument fails to comprehend the full scope of the 
 
Sixth Amendment and is refuted by precedent.  Here, the question is the fairness or reliability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which caused respondent to lose benefits he would have received but for counsels ineffective assistance.  Furthermore, a reliable trial may not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have altered the outcome.  See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 

477 U.S. 365
.  Petitioners position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective assistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.  See Missouri v. Frye, ante, at ___.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				2.Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the remedy must neutralize the taint of a constitutional violation, United States v. Morrison, 

449 U.S. 361
, but must not grant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State properly invested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v. Mechanik, 

475 U.S. 66
.  If the sole advantage is that the defendant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court should have an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.  If so, the court may exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something in between.  However, resentencing based on the conviction at trial may not suffice, e.g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious counts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial, or where a mandatory sentence confines a judges sentencing discretion.  In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea.  The judge can then exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and accept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed.  In either situation, a court must weigh various factors.  Here, it suffices to give two relevant considerations.  First, a court may take account of a defendants earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept responsibility for his or her actions.  Second, it is not necessary here to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard any information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer was made.  Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such claims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed or that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland claims.  In addition, the prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims.  See Frye, ante, at ___.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				3.This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Appeals analysis of respondents ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was contrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no bar to relief.  Respondent has satisfied Stricklands two-part test.  The parties concede the fact of deficient performance.  And respondent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.  In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3 times greater than he would have received under the plea.  As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea.  If respondent accepts the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determining whether to vacate respondents convictions and resentence pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence resulting from the trial undisturbed.  Pp.1416.

, and the right to counsel during sentencing, see, e.g., Glover v. United States, 

531 U.S. 198
204.  This Court has not followed a rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular error at issue.  See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 

474 U.S. 254
.  Second, this Court has previously rejected petitioners argument that Lockhart v. Fretwell, 

506 U.S. 364
, modified Strickland and does so again here.  Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside, 

475 U.S. 157
, demonstrate that it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate prejudice, Williams v. Taylor, 

529 U.S. 362
392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense strategy outside the law.  Here, however, respondent seeks relief from counsels failure to meet a valid legal standard.  Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction by arguing that the 
 
Sixth Amendments purpose is to ensure a convictions reliability, but this argument fails to comprehend the full scope of the 
 
Sixth Amendment and is refuted by precedent.  Here, the question is the fairness or reliability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which caused respondent to lose benefits he would have received but for counsels ineffective assistance.  Furthermore, a reliable trial may not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have altered the outcome.  See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 

477 U.S. 365
.  Petitioners position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective assistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.  See Missouri v. Frye, ante, at ___.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				2.Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the remedy must neutralize the taint of a constitutional violation, United States v. Morrison, 

449 U.S. 361
, but must not grant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State properly invested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v. Mechanik, 

475 U.S. 66
.  If the sole advantage is that the defendant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court should have an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.  If so, the court may exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something in between.  However, resentencing based on the conviction at trial may not suffice, e.g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious counts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial, or where a mandatory sentence confines a judges sentencing discretion.  In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea.  The judge can then exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and accept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed.  In either situation, a court must weigh various factors.  Here, it suffices to give two relevant considerations.  First, a court may take account of a defendants earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept responsibility for his or her actions.  Second, it is not necessary here to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard any information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer was made.  Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such claims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed or that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland claims.  In addition, the prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims.  See Frye, ante, at ___.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				3.This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Appeals analysis of respondents ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was contrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no bar to relief.  Respondent has satisfied Stricklands two-part test.  The parties concede the fact of deficient performance.  And respondent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.  In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3 times greater than he would have received under the plea.  As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea.  If respondent accepts the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determining whether to vacate respondents convictions and resentence pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence resulting from the trial undisturbed.  Pp.1416.

			In this case, a criminal defendant sought a remedy when inadequate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of a plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable outcome. After the plea offer had been rejected, there was a full and fair trial before the jury. After a guilty verdict, defendant received a sentence harsher than that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant case came to the Court with the concession that counsel's advice with respect to the plea offer fell below the standard of adequate assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that, where counsel's ineffective advice led to an offer's rejection, and where the prejudice alleged was having to stand trial, a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice, there was a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed. Therefore, the Court vacated the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remanded for further proceedings.

				MISSOURI v. FRYE
			

				certiorari to the court of appeals of missouri, western district
			

				No. 10444.Argued October 31, 2011
				
				Decided March 21, 2012
			

				Respondent Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license.  Because he had been convicted of the same offense three times before, he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maximum 4-year prison term.  The prosecutor sent Fryes counsel a letter, offering two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90-day sentence.  Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they expired.  Less than a week before Fryes preliminary hearing, he was again arrested for driving with a revoked license.  He subsequently pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced to three years in prison.  Seeking postconviction relief in state court, he alleged his counsels failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testified that he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of the offer.  The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a 
 
Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
.  Specifically, the court found that defense counsel had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and concluded that Frye had shown that counsels deficient performance caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor. 
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.The 
 
Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.  That right applies to all critical stages of the criminal proceedings.  Montejo v. Louisiana, 

556 U.S. 778
.  Hill v. Lockhart, 

474 U.S. 52
, established that Stricklands two-part test governs ineffective-assistance claims in the plea bargain context.  There, the defendant had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about his plea, but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial had he received the proper advice.  474 U.S., at 60.  In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, where a plea offer was set aside because counsel had misinformed the defendant of its immigration consequences, this Court made clear that the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical stage for ineffective-assistance purposes, id., at ___, and rejected the argument made by the State in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes defense counsels errors.  The State attempts to distinguish Hill and Padilla from the instant case.  It notes that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present, while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected; and it insists that there is no right to receive a plea offer in any event.  Thus, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsels inadequacies when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved.  While these contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, they do not suffice to overcome the simple reality that 97 percent of federal convictions and 94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.  Plea bargains have become so central to todays criminal justice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the 
 
Sixth Amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal process.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				2.As a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.  Any exceptions to this rule need not be addressed here, for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.  Standards for prompt communication and consultation recommended by the American Bar Association and adopted by numerous state and federal courts, though not determinative, serve as important guides.  The prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims.  First, a formal offers terms and processing can be documented.  Second, States may require that all offers be in writing.  Third, formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before the later proceedings commence.  Here, as the result of counsels deficient performance, the offers lapsed.  Under Strickland, the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the breach of duty.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				3.To show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of counsels deficient performance, defendants must demonstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted the more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without the prosecutions canceling it or the trial courts refusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.  This application of Strickland to uncommunicated, lapsed pleas does not alter Hills standard, which requires a defendant complaining that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of going to trial to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsels errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.  474 U.S., at 59.  Hill correctly applies in the context in which it arose, but it does not provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from counsels deficient performance during plea negotiations.  Because Frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to entering an open plea, Stricklands inquiry into whether the result of the proceeding would have been different, 466 U.S., at 694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer.  He must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented.  This further showing is particularly important because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford v. Bursey, 

429 U.S. 545
, nor a federal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New York, 

404 U.S. 257
.  Missouri, among other States, appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a plea agreement; and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, some state rules, including Missouris, and this Courts precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements.  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				4.Applying these standards here, the Missouri court correctly concluded that counsels failure to inform Frye of the written plea offer before it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard, but it failed to require Frye to show that the plea offer would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court.  These matters should be addressed by the Missouri appellate court in the first instance.  Given that Fryes new offense for driving without a license occurred a week before his preliminary hearing, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were required by state law to do so.  Pp.1315.
			

				311 S.W. 3d 350, vacated and remanded.

				MARTINEZ v. RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101001.Argued October 4, 2011Decided March 20, 2012
			

				Arizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review.  In petitioner Martinezs first state collateral proceeding, his counsel did not raise such a claim.  On federal habeas review with new counsel, Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial and in his first state collateral proceeding.  He also claimed that he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial.  The District Court denied the petition, finding that Arizonas preclusion rule was an adequate and independent state-law ground barring federal review, and that under Coleman v. Thompson, 

501 U.S. 722
, the attorneys errors in the postconviction proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.  Pp.514.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Given that the precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on an ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding, this is not the case to resolve the question left open in Coleman: whether a prisoner has a constitutional right to effective counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings.  However, to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate ineffective-assistance claims, it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to Colemans unqualified statement that an attorneys ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default, namely, that inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)A federal court can hear Martinezs ineffective-assistance claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.  Coleman held that a  postconviction attorneys negligence does not qualify as cause, because the attorney is the prisoners agent, and the principal bears the risk of his agents negligent conduct, Maples v. Thomas, ante, at 12.  However, in Coleman, counsels alleged error was on appeal from an initial-review collateral proceeding.  Thus, his claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court.  This marks a key difference between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collateral proceedings.  Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffective-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a prisoners direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas court decides the claims merits, no other court has addressed the claim, and defendants are generally ill equipped to represent themselves where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion addressing their claim.  Halbert v. Michigan, 

545 U.S. 605
.  An attorneys errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the States procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claim.  Without adequate representation in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim.  The same would be true if the State did not appoint an attorney for the initial-review collateral proceeding.  A prisoners inability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular concern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle in this Nations justice system.
			

				
				
				Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance at trial when an attorneys errors (or an attorneys absence) caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim.  It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such claim in two circumstances: where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been raised, was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
.  To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial.  Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance claims.  It is likely that such attorneys are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional norms.  And where that is so, States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate stare decisis concerns.  Colemans holding remains true except as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at trial.  The holding in this case should not put a significant strain on state resources.  A State facing the question of cause for an apparent default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is insubstantial.  The limited circumstances recognized here also reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.  Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adversary system.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does not bar Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				2.Whether Martinezs attorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that remain open for a decision on remand.  P.15.
			

				623 F.3d 731, reversed and remanded.

Thomas, ante, at 12.  However, in Coleman, counsels alleged error was on appeal from an initial-review collateral proceeding.  Thus, his claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court.  This marks a key difference between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collateral proceedings.  Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffective-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a prisoners direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas court decides the claims merits, no other court has addressed the claim, and defendants are generally ill equipped to represent themselves where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion addressing their claim.  Halbert v. Michigan, 

545 U.S. 605
.  An attorneys errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the States procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claim.  Without adequate representation in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim.  The same would be true if the State did not appoint an attorney for the initial-review collateral proceeding.  A prisoners inability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular concern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle in this Nations justice system.
			

				
				
				Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance at trial when an attorneys errors (or an attorneys absence) caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim.  It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such claim in two circumstances: where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been raised, was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
.  To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial.  Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance claims.  It is likely that such attorneys are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional norms.  And where that is so, States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate stare decisis concerns.  Colemans holding remains true except as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at trial.  The holding in this case should not put a significant strain on state resources.  A State facing the question of cause for an apparent default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is insubstantial.  The limited circumstances recognized here also reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.  Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adversary system.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does not bar Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				2.Whether Martinezs attorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that remain open for a decision on remand.  P.15.

			Arizona prisoners could raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review. In petitioner's first state collateral proceeding, his counsel did not raise such a claim. On federal habeas review with new counsel, petitioner argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial and in his first state collateral proceeding. He also claimed that he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial. The Court held that where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default would not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those clams if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in the proceeding was ineffective. Therefore, the Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

				The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) entitles an employee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per year for (A) the care of a newborn son or daughter; (B) the adoption or foster-care placement of a child; (C) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious medical condition; and (D) the employees own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employees ability to perform at work.  
29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(1).  The FMLA also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court.  2617(a)(2).  For present purposes, subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and subparagraph (D) as the self-care provision.  In Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 

538 U.S. 721
732, this Court held that Congress could subject States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C) based on evidence of family-leave policies that discriminated on the basis of sex.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner filed suit, alleging that his employer, the Maryland Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the State, violated the FMLA by denying him self-care leave.  The Federal District Court dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity grounds.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that unlike the family-care provision in Hibbs, the self-care provision was not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				626 F.3d 187, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded that suits against States under the self-care provision are barred by sovereign immunity.  Pp.312.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the federal system, States, as sovereigns, are immune from damages suits, unless they waive that defense.  See, e.g., Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 

528 U.S. 62
73.  Congress may also abrogate the States immunity pursuant to its powers under 5 of the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment, but it must make that intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute, Hibbs, supra, at 726.  It did so in the FMLA.  Congress also must tailor legislation enacted under 5 to remedy or prevent conduct transgressing the 
 
Fourteenth Amendments substantive provisions.  Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 

527 U.S. 627
.  There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.  City of Boerne v. Flores, 

521 U.S. 507
.  Pp. 35.
			

				
				
				(b)The sex-based discrimination that supported allowing subparagraph (C) suits against States is absent with respect to the self-care provision.  Petitioners three arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Pp.512.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Petitioner maintains that the self-care provision addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping.  But the provision, standing alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States immunity from suit.  At the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such discrimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies.  Congress was concerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss on employees and their families and about discrimination based on illness, not sex.  Although the self-care provision offers some women a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional violations.  When the FMLA was enacted, Congress had no evidence that States were excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from their leave policies.  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Petitioner also argues that the self-care provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs.  But his claimthat the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availability of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their different leave-usage patternsis unconvincing and does not comply with the requirements of City of Boerne.  Also, there are no congressional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer discrimination against women.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Finally, petitioner contends that the self-care provision helps single parents keep their jobs when they get ill.  The fact that most single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women.  However, [a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of ... discrimination ...  such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.  Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 

531 U.S. 356
.  Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional, the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.  Pp.1112.   
			

				
				
				Justice Scalia adhered to his view that the Court should abandon the congruence and proportionality approach in favor of one that is properly tied to the text of 5, which grants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the other provisions of the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  Outside the context of racial discrimination, Congresss 5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not reach a States failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.  Pp.12.

				Although laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable subject matter under 101 of the Patent Act, Diamond v. Diehr, 

450 U.S. 175
, an application of a law of nature ... to a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection, id., at 187.  But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words apply it.  See, e.g., Gottschalk v. Benson, 

409 U.S. 63
72.  It must limit its reach to a particular, inventive application of the law.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases.  When ingested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the bloodstream.  Because patients metabolize these drugs differently, doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular patients dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective.  The patent claims here set forth processes embodying researchers findings that identify correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision.  Each claim recites (1) an administering stepinstructing a doctor to administer the drug to his patient(2) a determining steptelling the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patients bloodand (3) a wherein stepdescribing the metabolite concentrations above which there is a likelihood of harmful side-effects and below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and informing the doctor that metabolite concentrations above or below these thresholds indicate a need to decrease or increase (respectively) the drug dosage.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners Mayo Collaborative Services and Mayo Clinic Rochester (Mayo) bought and used diagnostic tests based on Prometheus patents.  But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and market its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test.  Prometheus sued Mayo contending that Mayos test infringed its patents.  The District Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomenanamely, the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopurine drugsand therefore are not patentable.  The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligible under the Circuits machine or transformation test.  On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. ___, which clarified that the machine or transformation test is not a definitive test of patent eligibility, id., at ______, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclusion.
			

				Held:Prometheus process is not patent eligible.  Pp.824.
			

				
				
				(a)Because the laws of nature recited by Prometheus patent claimsthe relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a thiopurine drug dosage will prove ineffective or cause harmare not themselves patentable, the claimed processes are not patentable unless they have additional features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to monopolize the correlations.  The three additional steps in the claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claims.  The administering step simply identifies a group of people who will be interested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders.  Doctors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these patents existed.  And a prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.  Bilski, supra, at ___.  The wherein clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test results when making their treatment decisions.  The determining step tells a doctor to measure patients metabolite levels, through whatever process the doctor wishes to use.  Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.  Such activity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.  Parker v. Flook, 

437 U.S. 584
.  Finally, considering the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				(b)A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents reinforces this conclusion.  Pp.1119.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both addressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of nature, are not themselves patentable.  In Diehr, the overall process was patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole.  450 U.S., at 187.  These additional steps transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.  But in Flook, the additional steps of the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and the particular chemical processes at issue were all well known, to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no inventive concept in the claimed application of the formula.  437 U.S., at 594.  Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is weaker than Diehrs patent-eligible claim and no stronger than Flooks unpatentable one.  The three steps add nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field.  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patentable is provided in OReilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 114115; Neilson v. Harford, Websters Patent Cases 295, 371; Bilski, supra, at ______; and Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67.  Pp.1416.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent law not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of laws of nature and the like.  See, e.g., Benson, 409 U.S., at 67, 68.  Rewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might encourage their discovery.  But because those laws and principles are the basic tools of scientific and technological work, id., at 67, there is a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process is no more than a general instruction to apply the natural law, or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify.  The patent claims at issue implicate this concern.  In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correlations they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision regardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations.  And they threaten to inhibit the development of more refined treatment recommendations that combine Prometheus correlations with later discoveries.  This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent.  Pp.1619.
			

				
				
				(c)Additional arguments supporting Prometheus positionthat the process is patent eligible because it passes the machine or transformation test; that, because the particular laws of nature that the claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld; that the Court should not invalidate these patents under 101 because the Patent Acts other validity requirements will screen out overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnostic laws of naturedo not lead to a different conclusion.  Pp.1924.

And a prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.  Bilski, supra, at ___.  The wherein clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test results when making their treatment decisions.  The determining step tells a doctor to measure patients metabolite levels, through whatever process the doctor wishes to use.  Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.  Such activity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.  Parker v. Flook, 

437 U.S. 584
.  Finally, considering the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				(b)A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents reinforces this conclusion.  Pp.1119.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both addressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of nature, are not themselves patentable.  In Diehr, the overall process was patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole.  450 U.S., at 187.  These additional steps transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.  But in Flook, the additional steps of the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and the particular chemical processes at issue were all well known, to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no inventive concept in the claimed application of the formula.  437 U.S., at 594.  Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is weaker than Diehrs patent-eligible claim and no stronger than Flooks unpatentable one.  The three steps add nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field.  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patentable is provided in OReilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 114115; Neilson v. Harford, Websters Patent Cases 295, 371; Bilski, supra, at ______; and Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67.  Pp.1416.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent law not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of laws of nature and the like.  See, e.g., Benson, 409 U.S., at 67, 68.  Rewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might encourage their discovery.  But because those laws and principles are the basic tools of scientific and technological work, id., at 67, there is a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process is no more than a general instruction to apply the natural law, or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify.  The patent claims at issue implicate this concern.  In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correlations they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision regardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations.  And they threaten to inhibit the development of more refined treatment recommendations that combine Prometheus correlations with later discoveries.  This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent.  Pp.1619.
			

				
				
				(c)Additional arguments supporting Prometheus positionthat the process is patent eligible because it passes the machine or transformation test; that, because the particular laws of nature that the claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld; that the Court should not invalidate these patents under 101 because the Patent Acts other validity requirements will screen out overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnostic laws of naturedo not lead to a different conclusion.  Pp.1924.
			

				628 F.3d 1347, reversed.
			

				
				
				Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
			"|"
			The patent claims at issue covered processes that help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat patients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a given dosage level was too low or too high. The claims purported to apply natural laws describing the relationships between the concentration in the blood of certain thiopurine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage would be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. At issue was whether the claimed processes have transformed these unpatentable natural laws into patent-eligible applications of those laws. The Court concluded that they have not done so and that therefore the processes were not patentable. The steps in the claimed processes involved well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field. At the same time, upholding the patents would risk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further discoveries. Therefore, the Court reversed the judgment of the Federal Circuit.

				No. 101399.Argued January 11, 2012Decided March 20, 2012
			

				The Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA) creates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible employees disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.  Benefits for most types of disabilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an injured employee is newly awarded compensation.  
33 U.S.C. 906(c).  The LHWCA requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no compensation orders are issued.  However,  if an employer controverts liability, or an employee contests his employers actions with respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of Labors Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be resolved, if possible, through informal procedures.  An informal disposition may result in a compensation order.  If not resolved informally, the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.
			

				
				
				
				
				In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services, Inc.  Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts benefits until fiscal year 2005.  Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land controverted.  In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year 2007, when, he argued, he was newly awarded compensation by order of the ALJ.  The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of Labors Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:An employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf.  Pp. 518.
			

				
				
				(a)Roberts contends that the statutory term awarded compensation means awarded compensation in a formal order, while Sea-Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.  Although 906 can be interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Directors interpretation makes 906 a working part of the statutory scheme.  Under Roberts interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has been awarded compensation, so none is subject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.  That result is incompatible with the LHWCAs design.  Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary of Labor.  Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it becomes the applicable national average weekly wage for the coming fiscal year.  And 906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretarys determination shall apply to those newly awarded compensation during such fiscal year.  Through a series of cross-references, the three provisions work together to cap disability benefits.  By its terms, and subject to one express exception, 906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all disability claims.  Because all three provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if 906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases.  Roberts interpretation would give 906(c) no application in the many cases in which no formal orders issue.
			

				
				
				Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCAs administrative structure.  An employer must be able to calculate the cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employees disability, see 914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid.  Similarly, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the applicable cap.  It is difficult to see how an employer or claims examiner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the LHWCAs purpose to compensate disability, defined as incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.  902(10).  It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees; Roberts reading would permit two employees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to receive different maximum compensation rates based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.  Finally, applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process.  If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with inflation would be unduly significant.  Roberts rule would reward employees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate, while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments.  Pp. 513.
			

				
				
				(b)Roberts counterarguments are unconvincing.  First, although the LHWCA sometimes uses award to mean award in a formal order, the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields whenever, as here, the variation in the words use in the LHWCA reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different parts of the Act with different intent.  See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 

540 U.S. 581
.
			

				
				
				Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to read the statutory phrase person entitled to compensation in 933(g) to mean person awarded compensation, Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 

505 U.S. 469
, the converse must also be true: awarded compensation in 906(c) cannot mean entitled to compensation.  But Cowarts reasoning does not work in reverse.  Cowart did not construe 906(c) or award, see id., at 478479, and it did not hold that the groups of employees entitled to compensation and employees awarded compensation were mutually exclusive, see id., at 477.
			

				
				
				Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the LHWCAs purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative proceedings.  But his remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their employees injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to file claims.  The more measured deterrent to employer delay is interest that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due.  Pp.1318.

				MARTEL, WARDEN v. CLAIR
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 101265.Argued December 6, 2011Decided March 5, 2012
			

				Respondent Clair was charged with capital murder for the 1984 slaying of Linda Rodgers.  The main evidence at his trial in California state court came from statements Clair made to his former girlfriend in a conversation that she secretly recorded for the police.  He was convicted and sentenced to death, and his verdict was upheld on direct review.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 1994, Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel, which the District Court granted under 
18 U.S.C. 3599.  That statute entitles indigent capital habeas petitioners like Clair to appointed counsel.  It also contemplates that appointed counsel may be replaced ... upon motion of the defendant, 3599(e), but it does not specify a standard for district courts to use in evaluating those motions.  Clairs counsel filed his initial habeas petition in 1994, and in the late 1990s, when two associates from the firm representing Clair moved to the Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), the FPD was substituted as counsel of record.  The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Clairs habeas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted their post-hearing briefs by February 2005.  The court subsequently told the parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the petition.  In March, Clair moved to substitute counsel, claiming that his attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, not to prove his innocence.  After the court asked the parties to address the motion, Clairs counsel informed it that they had met with Clair and that he wanted the FPD to continue representing him.  The court accordingly decided that it would take no action.  Six weeks later, however, Clair filed another substitution motion, adding one more charge to his earlier claims: that his private investigator had discovered that certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully tested, but that Clairs attorneys had done nothing to analyze this evidence or follow up on its discovery.  The court denied the renewed motion without further inquiry.  On the same day, it also denied Clairs habeas petition.
			

				
				
				
				
				Clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se, and the FPD appealed the habeas ruling.  The Ninth Circuit asked the FPD to address whether substitution was now warranted, and after the FPD informed the court that the attorney-client relationship had broken down, the court provided Clair with a new lawyer.  Clair then asked the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.  The District Court rejected his request, and Clair appealed.  Consolidating his appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Courts denial of both his substitution request and his habeas petition.  Holding that the interests of justice standard used in non-capital cases, see 
18 U.S.C. 3006A, should govern substitution motions like Clairs, it ruled that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clairs second letter.  Because Clair had already received new counsel on appeal, the court decided the best remedy was to treat Clairs new counsel as though he had been appointed in June 2005 and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend Clairs habeas petition in light of new evidence.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.When evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases under 
18 U.S.C. 3599, courts should employ the same interests of justice standard that applies in non-capital cases under 3006A.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Although 3599 guarantees that indigent capital defendants and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel, see, e.g., 3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e), and contemplates that an appointed attorney may be replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorneys own motion or upon motion of the defendant, 3599(e), the statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.  Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that district courts should use the in the interests of justice standard of 3006A, which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation.  By contrast, the State contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when the defendant has suffered an actual or constructive denial of counselthat is, when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifications, has a conflict of interest, or has completely abandoned the client.
			

				
				
				The Court adopts Clairs approach, based on the history of 3599.  Before 1988, 3006A governed both capital and non-capital cases, authorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and providing that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel, substitution motions should be decided in the interests of justice.  3006A(c).  Thus, a court in those days would have used that standard to evaluate a request like Clairs.  In 1988, Congress enacted what is now 3599, thus displacing 3006A for persons facing execution.  The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation.  Habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, see 3599(a)(2), and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the quality of their representation: it provides them with more experienced counsel than 3006A demands, authorizes higher rates of compensation, and provides more money for investigative and expert services.  These measures reflec[t] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capital proceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.  McFarland v. Scott, 

512 U.S. 849
.  Given this context, the Court cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital punishment to substitute counsel.  Adopting a more stringent test than 3006As would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and non-capital defendants still have, to handle serious rep- resentational problems.  By contrast, utilizing 3006As standard comports with the myriad ways that 3599 seeks to promote effective representation for persons facing capital punishment.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The dearth of support for the States alternative standard reinforces this conclusion.  The State concedes that Congress has not considered its standard in any context; neither has a federal court used it in any case.  The Court prefers to use a familiar standard, already known to work, than to try out a new one.  Moreover, the States proposed test would gut 3599s substitution provision, because even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to ensure that the defendants statutory right to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation.  The State counters that only its approach comports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  But Congress declined to track that Amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both 3006A and 3599.  Thus, the scope of the Amendment cannot answer the statutory question presented here.  The State also contends that the interests of justice standard will permit substitution motions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence.  But the interests of justice standard takes into account whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay.  Pp.912.
			

				
				
				2.The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clairs second request for new counsel under 3599s interests of justice standard.  In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several relevant considerations, including: the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district courts inquiry into the defendants complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client.  Because a trial courts decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference and may be overturned only for an abuse of discretion.
			

				
				
				Here, the District Court received Clairs second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition.  Just three months earlier, Clair had written the court to complain about his attorneys.  After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to ruling on Clairs habeas petition, only to receive a second letter six weeks later.  In it Clair maintained his general assertion that his lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, but he also alleged a new and significant charge of attorney error: that counsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.  Such a charge normally would require the court to make further inquiry; a district court cannot usually rule on a substitution motion without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel.  But here, the motions timing precludes a holding that the District Court abused its discretion.  The court received the letter while putting the finishing touches on its denial of Clairs habeas petition.  After years of litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and post-hearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.  All proceedings had therefore come to a close, and a new attorney could have done nothing further in the District Court.  In those circumstances, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Clairs substitution motion.  Pp.1316.

It also contemplates that appointed counsel may be replaced ... upon motion of the defendant, 3599(e), but it does not specify a standard for district courts to use in evaluating those motions.  Clairs counsel filed his initial habeas petition in 1994, and in the late 1990s, when two associates from the firm representing Clair moved to the Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), the FPD was substituted as counsel of record.  The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Clairs habeas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted their post-hearing briefs by February 2005.  The court subsequently told the parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the petition.  In March, Clair moved to substitute counsel, claiming that his attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, not to prove his innocence.  After the court asked the parties to address the motion, Clairs counsel informed it that they had met with Clair and that he wanted the FPD to continue representing him.  The court accordingly decided that it would take no action.  Six weeks later, however, Clair filed another substitution motion, adding one more charge to his earlier claims: that his private investigator had discovered that certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully tested, but that Clairs attorneys had done nothing to analyze this evidence or follow up on its discovery.  The court denied the renewed motion without further inquiry.  On the same day, it also denied Clairs habeas petition.
			

				
				
				
				
				Clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se, and the FPD appealed the habeas ruling.  The Ninth Circuit asked the FPD to address whether substitution was now warranted, and after the FPD informed the court that the attorney-client relationship had broken down, the court provided Clair with a new lawyer.  Clair then asked the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.  The District Court rejected his request, and Clair appealed.  Consolidating his appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Courts denial of both his substitution request and his habeas petition.  Holding that the interests of justice standard used in non-capital cases, see 
18 U.S.C. 3006A, should govern substitution motions like Clairs, it ruled that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clairs second letter.  Because Clair had already received new counsel on appeal, the court decided the best remedy was to treat Clairs new counsel as though he had been appointed in June 2005 and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend Clairs habeas petition in light of new evidence.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.When evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases under 
18 U.S.C. 3599, courts should employ the same interests of justice standard that applies in non-capital cases under 3006A.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Although 3599 guarantees that indigent capital defendants and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel, see, e.g., 3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e), and contemplates that an appointed attorney may be replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorneys own motion or upon motion of the defendant, 3599(e), the statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.  Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that district courts should use the in the interests of justice standard of 3006A, which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation.  By contrast, the State contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when the defendant has suffered an actual or constructive denial of counselthat is, when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifications, has a conflict of interest, or has completely abandoned the client.
			

				
				
				The Court adopts Clairs approach, based on the history of 3599.  Before 1988, 3006A governed both capital and non-capital cases, authorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and providing that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel, substitution motions should be decided in the interests of justice.  3006A(c).  Thus, a court in those days would have used that standard to evaluate a request like Clairs.  In 1988, Congress enacted what is now 3599, thus displacing 3006A for persons facing execution.  The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation.  Habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, see 3599(a)(2), and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the quality of their representation: it provides them with more experienced counsel than 3006A demands, authorizes higher rates of compensation, and provides more money for investigative and expert services.  These measures reflec[t] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capital proceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.  McFarland v. Scott, 

512 U.S. 849
.  Given this context, the Court cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital punishment to substitute counsel.  Adopting a more stringent test than 3006As would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and non-capital defendants still have, to handle serious rep- resentational problems.  By contrast, utilizing 3006As standard comports with the myriad ways that 3599 seeks to promote effective representation for persons facing capital punishment.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The dearth of support for the States alternative standard reinforces this conclusion.  The State concedes that Congress has not considered its standard in any context; neither has a federal court used it in any case.  The Court prefers to use a familiar standard, already known to work, than to try out a new one.  Moreover, the States proposed test would gut 3599s substitution provision, because even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to ensure that the defendants statutory right to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation.  The State counters that only its approach comports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  But Congress declined to track that Amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both 3006A and 3599.  Thus, the scope of the Amendment cannot answer the statutory question presented here.  The State also contends that the interests of justice standard will permit substitution motions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence.  But the interests of justice standard takes into account whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay.  Pp.912.
			

				
				
				2.The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clairs second request for new counsel under 3599s interests of justice standard.  In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several relevant considerations, including: the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district courts inquiry into the defendants complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client.  Because a trial courts decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference and may be overturned only for an abuse of discretion.
			

				
				
				Here, the District Court received Clairs second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition.  Just three months earlier, Clair had written the court to complain about his attorneys.  After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to ruling on Clairs habeas petition, only to receive a second letter six weeks later.  In it Clair maintained his general assertion that his lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, but he also alleged a new and significant charge of attorney error: that counsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.  Such a charge normally would require the court to make further inquiry; a district court cannot usually rule on a substitution motion without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel.  But here, the motions timing precludes a holding that the District Court abused its discretion.  The court received the letter while putting the finishing touches on its denial of Clairs habeas petition.  After years of litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and post-hearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.  All proceedings had therefore come to a close, and a new attorney could have done nothing further in the District Court.  In those circumstances, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Clairs substitution motion.  Pp.1316.

			Respondent was convicted of capital murder and subsequently commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C. 3599. Section 3599(e) contemplated that appointed counsel could be ""replaced . . . upon motion of the defendant,"" but did not specify the standard that district courts should use in evaluating those motions. The Court held that courts should employ the same ""interests of justice"" standard that they apply in non-capital cases under a related statute, 18 U.S.C. 3006A. The Court also held that the district court here did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent's motion to change counsel.

				KURNS, executrix of the ESTATE OF CORSON, DECEASED, etal. v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP. etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 10879.Argued November 9, 2011Decided February 29, 2012
			

				George Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.  After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma.  He and his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Products Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from Corsons exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts distributed by respondents.  The Corsons alleged state-law claims of defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.  After Corson died, petitioner Kurns, executrix of his estate, was substituted as a party.  Respondents removed the case to the Federal District Court, which granted them summary judgment, ruling that the state-law claims were pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA), 
49 U.S.C. 20701 et seq.  The Third Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:Petitioners state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R.Co., 

272 U.S. 605
.  Pp.211.
			

				
				
				(a)The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury, have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations prescribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can withstand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary.  See 20701.  Pp.23.
			

				
				
				(b)Congress may expressly pre-empt state law.  But even without an express pre-emption provision, state law must yield to a congressional Act to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute, see Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 

530 U.S. 363
, or when the federal statutes scope indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 

514 U.S. 280
.  This case involves only the latter, so-called field pre-emption.  Pp.34.
			

				
				
				(c)In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Commission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIAs requirements) was a general one that extends to the design, the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.  272 U.S., at 611.  The Court rejected the States contention that the scope of the pre-empted field was to be determined by the object sought through legislation, rather than the physical elements affected by it, id., at 612, and found it dispositive that [t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the same subjectthe equipment of locomotives.  Ibid.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(d)The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter the LIAs pre-emptive scope.  By its terms, the FRSAwhich instructs that [t]he Secretary of Transportation ... shall prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970, 
49 U.S.C. 20103(a)does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety statutes.  Rather, it leaves those statutes intactand authorizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supplemental regulation.  Because the LIA was already in effect when the FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Napier, intact.  P.6.
			

				
				
				(e)Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled.  Pp.67.  Instead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIAs pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier.  Petitioners arguments are unpersuasive.  First, the argument that the pre-empted field does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napiers holding that Congress, in enacting the LIA, manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.  272 U.S., at 611.  Second, the argument that petitioners failure-to-warn claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied by sufficient warnings or instructions.  Because petitioners failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by Napier.  Third, the argument that petitioners claims are not pre-empted because manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation.  Finally, contrary to petitioners argument, the LIAs pre-emptive scope is not limited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive equipment.  Pp.611.
			

				620 F.3d 392, affirmed.

				Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical care to needy individuals.  To qualify for federal funds, a State must submit its Medicaid plan and any amendments to the federal agency that administers the program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  Before approving a plan or amendments, CMS conducts a review to determine whether they comply with federal requirements.  Federal law requires state plans or amendments to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers to make Medicaid care and services available.  
42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A).
			

				
				
				
				
				After California enacted three statutes reducing the States payments to various Medicaid providers, the State submitted plan amendments to CMS.  Before the agency finished its review, Medicaid providers and beneficiaries sought, in a series of cases, to enjoin the rate reductions on the ground that they were pre-empted by federal Medicaid law.  In seven decisions, the Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed or ordered preliminary injunctions preventing the State from implementing its statutes.  The court (1) held that the providers and beneficiaries could bring a Supremacy Clause action; (2) essentially accepted their claim that the State did not show that its amended plan would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the amendments thus conflicted with 1396a(a)(30)(A); and (4) held that the federal statute pre-empted the new state laws.  In the meantime, agency officials disapproved the amendments, and California sought further administrative review.  The cases were in this posture when the Court granted certiorari to decide whether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause challenge.  After oral argument, CMS approved several of the States amendments, and the State withdrew its requests for approval of the remainder.
			

				Held:The judgments are vacated and the cases are remanded, thereby permitting the parties to argue before the Ninth Circuit in the first instance the question whether respondents may maintain Supremacy Clause actions now that CMS has approved the state statutes.  Pp. 58.
			

				
				
				(a)CMS approval does not make these cases moot, but it does put them in a different posture, since the federal agency charged with administering Medicaid has now found that the rate reductions comply with federal law.  That decision does not change the substantive question whether Californias statutes are consistent with federal law, but it may change the answer.  It may also require respondents to seek review of CMS determination under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) rather than in a Supremacy Clause action against California.  The APA would likely permit respondents to obtain an authoritative judicial determination of the merits of their legal claim.  And their basic challenge now presents the kind of legal question ordinarily calling for APA review.  The Medicaid Act commits to a federal agency the power to administer a federal program, and the agency has exercised that authority.  As CMS is comparatively expert in the statutes subject matter, its decision carries weight.  And 1396a(a)(30)(A)s broad and general language suggests that CMS expertise is relevant in determining the provisions application.  Finally, to allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed once CMS has reached a decision threatens potential inconsistency or confusion.  The Ninth Circuit declined to give weight to the Federal Governments interpretation of the federal law, but courts are ordinarily required to apply deference standards to agency decisionmaking.  The parties suggest no reasons why such standards should not be applied here or why, now that CMS has acted, a court should reach a different result in an APA action than in a Supremacy Clause action.  That would make the Supremacy Clause challenge at best redundant.  Permitting it to continue would seem inefficient, for the federal agency is not a participant in the action, which will decide whether  agency-approved state rates violate federal law.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)Given the present posture of the cases, the Court does not address whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Supremacy Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final action.  To decide whether these cases may proceed under the Supremacy Clause now that the agency has acted, it will be necessary on remand to consider at least the matters addressed by this Court.  P.8.

			The Court granted certiorari in these cases to decide whether Medicaid providers and recipients could maintain a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause to enforce a federal Medicaid law. Since the Court granted certiorari, however, the relevant circumstances have changed. The federal agency in charge of administering Medicaid, CMS, approved the state statutes as consistent with the federal law. In light of the changed circumstances, the Court believed that the question before it was whether, once the agency approved the state statutes, groups of Medicaid providers and beneficiaries could still maintain a Supremacy Clause action asserting that the state statutes were inconsistent with the federal Medicaid law. Given the present posture of the cases, the Court did not address whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Supremacy Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final action. To decide whether these cases could proceed under the Supremacy Clause now that the agency has acted, it would be necessary on remand to consider at least the matters addressed by the Court. Accordingly, the Court vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.

				PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of montana
			

				No. 10218.Argued December 7, 2011Decided February 22, 2012
			

				Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric facilities in Montana.  Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Rivers.  Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and PPLs two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Ferry stretch.  These, together with two dams located in steep canyons on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project.  The Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River.  Both projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  PPLs facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a century.  Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects existence, sought no rent for use of the riverbeds.  Instead, the understanding of PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United States.  In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal suit, claiming that PPLs facilities were on riverbeds that were state owned and part of Montanas school trust lands.  The State joined the suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the riverbeds.  That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power companies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred from seeking compensation for PPLs riverbed use.  Montana counterclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use.  The trial court granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41 million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007.  The Montana Supreme Court affirmed.  Adopting a liberal construction of the navigability test, it discounted this Courts approach of considering the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of determining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments at the time of statehood.  Instead, the Montana court declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.  Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the time of statehood.
			

				Held:The Montana Supreme Courts ruling that Montana owns and may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm legal understanding of this Courts rules of navigability for title under the equal-footing doctrine.  Pp.1026.
			

				
				
				(a)The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold title in the soil of rivers really navigable, Shively v. Bowlby, 

152 U.S. 1
, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine.  Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of statehood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then navigable.  It may allocate and govern those lands according to state law subject only to the United States power to control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.  United States v. Oregon, 

295 U.S. 1
.  The United States retains title vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then navigable.  To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine, rivers must be navigable in fact, meaning they are used, or are susceptible of being used, ... as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.  The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563.  This formulation has been used to determine questions of waterbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.  See United States v. Utah, 

283 U.S. 64
.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(b)The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage.  To determine riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not.  See, e.g., Utah, supra, at 77.  The State Supreme Court erred in discounting this well-settled approach.  A key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that could interfere with the publics right to use the waters as a highway for commerce.  Because commerce could not have occurred on segments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.  Practical considerations also support segmentation.  Physical conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river and provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end points for disputed segments.  A segment approach is also consistent with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed title.  Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their value and PPLs corresponding rents.  The State Supreme Courts view that the segment-by-segment approach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not supported by this Courts Utah decision.  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments in this case would meet that standard.  Applying its short interruptions approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls reach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route portage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day would demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.  Thus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect to the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages were insufficient to defeat a navigability finding.  In most cases, they are, because they require transportation over land rather than over the water.  This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied The Montello, 20 Wall. 430.  There, portage was considered in determining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce for federal regulatory purposes.  The Montello does not control the outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply.  Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls reach.  Montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and the trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The Great Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.  There is also a significant likelihood that some of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigability test.  The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana courts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light of the principles discussed here.  Pp.1421.
			

				
				
				(c)The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in relying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the Madison River.  Navigability must be assessed as of the time of statehood, and it concerns a rivers usefulness for trade and travel.  Utah, 283 U.S., at 7576.  River segments are navigable if they [were] used and if they [were] susceptible of being used as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.  Id., at 76.  Evidence of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on susceptibility of commercial use at the time of statehood.  See id., at 8283.  In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at statehood, (1)the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and (2)the rivers poststatehood condition may not be materially different from its physical condition at statehood.  The State Supreme Court offered no indication that it made these necessary findings.  Pp.2124.
			

				
				
				(d)Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred as to the burden of proof regarding navigability.  P.24.
			

				
				
				(e)Montanas suggestion that denying the State title to the disputed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrinewhich concerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation, fishing, and other recreational usesunderscores its misapprehension of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines.  Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters within the States borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal regulatory power.  Pp.2425.
			

				
				
				(f)This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of Montanas sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar the States claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in title on the States long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doctrine.

			"|"
			This case concerned three rivers which flow through Montana and then beyond its borders. At issue was whether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in Montana were nonnavigable, as federal law defined that concept for purposes of determining whether the State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments, when the State entered the Union in 1989. Montana contended that the rivers must be found navigable at the disputed locations. The Court held that the Montana Supreme Court's ruling that Montana owned and could charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm legal understanding of the Court's rules of navigability for title under the equal-footing doctrine. The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage and erred as a matter of law in relying on evidence of present-day primarily recreational use of the Madison River. Because this analysis was sufficient to require reversal, the Court declined to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. Montana's suggestion that denying the State title to the disputed riverbeds would undermine the public trust doctrine underscored its misapprehension of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Finally, the reliance by petitioner and its predecessors in title on the State's long failure to assert title to the riverbeds was some evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doctrine. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.

				MESSERSCHMIDT etal. v. MILLENDER, executor of ESTATE OF MILLENDER, DECEASED, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10704.Argued December 5, 2011Decided February 22, 2012
			

				Shelly Kelly was afraid that she would be attacked by her boyfriend, Jerry Ray Bowen, while she moved out of her apartment.  She therefore requested police protection.  Two officers arrived, but they were called away to an emergency.  As soon as the officers left, Bowen showed up at the apartment, yelled I told you never to call the cops on me bitch! and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a second-story landing.  After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave.  Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the car, blowing out one of its tires.   
			

				
				
				
				
				Kelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the incident.  She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former foster mother, Augusta Millender.  Following this conversation, Messerschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he confirmed Bowens connection to the Millenders home, verified his membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders home for all firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang membership.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Messerschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his specialized training in gang-related crimes.  The second, expressly incorporated into the search warrant, described the incident and explained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the search.  It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night service because of Bowens gang ties.  Before submitting the application to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant and a deputy district attorney.  Messerschmidt then submitted the application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant.  The ensuing search uncovered only Millenders shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Millenders filed an action under 
42 U.S.C. 1983 against petitioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity from damages.  The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity.  The court held that the warrants authorization was unconstitutionally overbroad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime, and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrants deficiency.
			

				Held:The officers are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp. 819.
			

				
				
				(a)Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pearson v. Callahan, 

555 U.S. 223
.  Where the alleged 
 
Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner, or in objective good faith.  United States v. Leon, 

468 U.S. 897
923.  Nonetheless, that fact does not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness.  The Court has recognized an exception allowing suit when it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue.  Malley v. Briggs, 

475 U.S. 335
.  The shield of immunity otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where the warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.  Leon, 468 U.S., at 923.  The threshold for establishing this exception is high.  [I]n the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrates probable-cause determination because [i]t is the magistrates responsibility to determine whether the officers allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Leon, supra, at 921.  Pp. 810.
			

				
				
				(b)This case does not fall within that narrow exception.  It would not be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was probable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.  Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer could reasonably conclude that there was a fair probability that the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v. Gates, 

462 U.S. 213
, and that Bowens sawed-off shotgun was illegal.  Cf. 26 U.S.C.  5845(a), 5861(d).  Given Bowens possession of one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to kill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreasonable for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.  An officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly.  California law allows a magistrate to issue a search warrant for items in the possession of any person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a public offense, Cal. Penal Code Ann. 1524(a)(3), and the warrant application submitted by the officers specifically referenced this provision as a basis for the search.  Pp.1012.
			

				
				
				(c)Regarding the warrants authorization to search for gang-related materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowens attack as motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly but by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police.  It would therefore not be unreasonablebased on the facts set out in the affidavitfor an officer to believe that evidence of Bowens gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges against Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting his defenses.  Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders residence could demonstrate Bowens control over the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.  Pp. 1216.
			

				
				
				(d)The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for the conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.  A contrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence were plainly incompetent in concluding that the warrant was supported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.  Pp. 1618.
			

				
				
				(e)In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 

540 U.S. 551
.  There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe any of the items to be seized and even a cursory reading of the warrant would have revealed this defect.  Id., at 557.  Here, in contrast, any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the supporting affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in the warrant.  Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that just a simple glance would have revealed.  Id. at 564.  Pp. 1819.
			

				620 F.3d 1016, reversed.

				MESSERSCHMIDT etal. v. MILLENDER, executor of ESTATE OF MILLENDER, DECEASED, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10704.Argued December 5, 2011Decided February 22, 2012
			

				Shelly Kelly was afraid that she would be attacked by her boyfriend, Jerry Ray Bowen, while she moved out of her apartment.  She therefore requested police protection.  Two officers arrived, but they were called away to an emergency.  As soon as the officers left, Bowen showed up at the apartment, yelled I told you never to call the cops on me bitch! and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a second-story landing.  After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave.  Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the car, blowing out one of its tires.   
			

				
				
				
				
				Kelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the incident.  She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former foster mother, Augusta Millender.  Following this conversation, Messerschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he confirmed Bowens connection to the Millenders home, verified his membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders home for all firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang membership.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Messerschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his specialized training in gang-related crimes.  The second, expressly incorporated into the search warrant, described the incident and explained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the search.  It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night service because of Bowens gang ties.  Before submitting the application to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant and a deputy district attorney.  Messerschmidt then submitted the application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant.  The ensuing search uncovered only Millenders shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Millenders filed an action under 
42 U.S.C. 1983 against petitioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity from damages.  The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity.  The court held that the warrants authorization was unconstitutionally overbroad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime, and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrants deficiency.
			

				Held:The officers are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp. 819.
			

				
				
				(a)Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pearson v. Callahan, 

555 U.S. 223
.  Where the alleged 
 
Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner, or in objective good faith.  United States v. Leon, 

468 U.S. 897
923.  Nonetheless, that fact does not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness.  The Court has recognized an exception allowing suit when it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue.  Malley v. Briggs, 

475 U.S. 335
.  The shield of immunity otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where the warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.  Leon, 468 U.S., at 923.  The threshold for establishing this exception is high.  [I]n the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrates probable-cause determination because [i]t is the magistrates responsibility to determine whether the officers allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Leon, supra, at 921.  Pp. 810.
			

				
				
				(b)This case does not fall within that narrow exception.  It would not be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was probable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.  Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer could reasonably conclude that there was a fair probability that the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v. Gates, 

462 U.S. 213
, and that Bowens sawed-off shotgun was illegal.  Cf. 26 U.S.C.  5845(a), 5861(d).  Given Bowens possession of one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to kill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreasonable for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.  An officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly.  California law allows a magistrate to issue a search warrant for items in the possession of any person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a public offense, Cal. Penal Code Ann. 1524(a)(3), and the warrant application submitted by the officers specifically referenced this provision as a basis for the search.  Pp.1012.
			

				
				
				(c)Regarding the warrants authorization to search for gang-related materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowens attack as motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly but by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police.  It would therefore not be unreasonablebased on the facts set out in the affidavitfor an officer to believe that evidence of Bowens gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges against Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting his defenses.  Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders residence could demonstrate Bowens control over the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.  Pp. 1216.
			

				
				
				(d)The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for the conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.  A contrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence were plainly incompetent in concluding that the warrant was supported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.  Pp. 1618.
			

				
				
				(e)In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 

540 U.S. 551
.  There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe any of the items to be seized and even a cursory reading of the warrant would have revealed this defect.  Id., at 557.  Here, in contrast, any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the supporting affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in the warrant.  Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that just a simple glance would have revealed.  Id. at 564.  Pp. 1819.
			

				620 F.3d 1016, reversed.
			

				
				
				Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Kagan, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.  
			"|"
			Respondents filed an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against petitioners, police officers, alleging that the officers had subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment to respondents and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of qualified immunity. The Court held, however, that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. The Court concluded that the case did not fall within the narrow exception to allowing suit where it would not be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was probable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materials. Regarding the warrant's authorization to search for gang-related materials, a reasonable officer could view Jerry Ray Bowen's attack as motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Shelly Kelly but by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police. The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to the magistrate provided further support for the conclusion than an officer could reasonably have believed that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause. In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.

				KAWASHIMA et ux. v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10577.Argued November 7, 2011Decided February 21, 2012
			

				An Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashimas conviction for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 
26 U.S.C. 7206(1), and Mrs. Kawashimas conviction for aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return, 7206(2), qualified as crimes involving fraud or deceit under 
8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause (i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deported under 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.  Holding that convictions under 26 U.S.C. 7206(1) and (2) in which the Governments revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashimas conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.
			

				Held:Convictions under 26 U.S.C. 7206(1) and (2) in which the Governments revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated felonies pursuant to Clause (i).  Pp.311.
			

				
				
				(a)The Kawashimas argument that they cannot be deported for the commission of an aggravated felony because crimes under 7206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by Clause (i) is rejected.  This Court looks to the statute defining the crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 

549 U.S. 183
, to determine whether the Kawashimas offenses involve fraud or deceit within the meaning of Clause (i).  Section 7206(1) provides that any person who willfully makes and subscribes any return ... which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter, shall be guilty of a felony.  Although the words fraud and deceit are absent from 7206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the crime, it does not follow that Mr. Kawashimas offense falls outside Clause (i). Clause (i) is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.  Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or deceitmeaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct.  Mr. Kawashimas conviction under 7206(1) involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submitted a tax return that was false as to a material matter.  Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating 7206(2), which declares that any person who [w]illfully aids or assists in ... the preparation or presentation ... of a return ... which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter has committed a felony.  She committed a felony involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her husbands filing of a materially false tax return.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)The Kawashimas argument that Clause (i), when considered in light of 
8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (Clause (ii)), must be interpreted as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected.  Clause (i) defines aggravated felony to mean an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.  Clause (ii) defines aggravated felony as an offense that is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.  Contrary to the Kawashimas claim, the difference in the clauses languagerevenue loss to the Government in Clause (ii) compared to loss to the victim in Clause (i)does not establish Congress intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).  By its plain language, Clause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Congress decision to tailor Clause (ii)s language to match the sole type of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)s broad scope.  Furthermore, interpreting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presumption against superfluities.  The specific inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the inclusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to 
26 U.S.C. 7201 was a deportable offense.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				(c)The United States Sentencing Guidelines separate treatment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the Kawashimas contention that Congress did not intend to include tax crimes within Clause (i).  No evidence suggests that Congress considered the Guidelines when drafting 
8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M).  Moreover, the differences between 1101(a)(43)(M) and the Guidelines undercut any inference that Congress was incorporating the distinction drawn by the Guidelines into 1101(a)(43)(M).  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				(d)Construing 1101(a)(43)(M) in the Kawashimas favor under the rule of lenity is not warranted in light of the statutes clear application.  P.11.
			

				615 F.3d 1043, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer and Kagan, JJ., joined.

			Petitioners, natives and citizens of Japan who have been lawful permanent residents of the United States since 1984, appealed a removal order after husband pleaded guilty to one count of willfully making and subscribing a false tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7206(1) and wife pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7206(2). At issue was whether aliens who commit certain federal tax crimes were subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony. The Court held that violations of section 7206(1) and (2) were crimes ""involv[ing] fraud or deceit"" under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) and were therefore aggravated felonies as that term was defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., when the loss to the Government exceeded $10,000. Because petitioners were subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

				HOWES, WARDEN v. FIELDS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 10680.Argued October 4, 2011Decided February 21, 2012
			

				Respondent Fields, a Michigan state prisoner, was escorted from his prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room where he was questioned by two sheriffs deputies about criminal activity he had allegedly engaged in before coming to prison.  At no time was Fields given Miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies.  As relevant here:  Fields was questioned for between five and seven hours; Fields was told more than once that he was free to leave and return to his cell; the deputies were armed, but Fields remained free of restraints; the conference room door was sometimes open and sometimes shut; several times during the interview Fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he did not ask to go back to his cell; after Fields confessed and the interview concluded, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for an escort and returned to his cell well after the hour when he generally retired.
			

				
				
				
				
				The trial court denied Fields motion to suppress his confession under Miranda v. Arizona, 

384 U.S. 436
, and he was convicted.  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Fields contention that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without a Miranda warning.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan subsequently granted Fields habeas relief under 28  U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the interview was a custodial interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, reasoning that Mathis v. United States, 

391 U.S. 1
, clearly established, 2254(d)(1), that isolation from the general prison population, combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such interrogation custodial per se.
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.This Courts precedents do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the Sixth Circuit relied.  The Court has repeatedly declined to adopt any such rule.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Perkins, 

496 U.S. 292
.  The Sixth Circuit misread Mathis, which simply held, as relevant here, that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda because he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense.  It did not hold that imprisonment alone constitutes Miranda custody.  Nor does the statement in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. ___, ___, that [n]o one questions that [inmate] Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purposes support a per se rule.  It means only that the issue of custody was not contested in that case.  Finally, contrary to respondents suggestion, Miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				2.The Sixth Circuits categorical rulethat imprisonment, questioning in private, and questioning about events in the outside world create a custodial situation for Miranda purposesis simply wrong.  Pp.813.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The initial step in determining whether a person is in Miranda custody is to ascertain, given all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, how a suspect would have gauged his freedom of movement.  Stansbury v. California, 

511 U.S. 318
.  However, not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to Miranda custody.  See, e.g., Berkemer v. McCarty, 

468 U.S. 420
.  Shatzer, distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and Miranda custody, held that a break in Miranda custody between a suspects invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment.  If a break in custody can occur, it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of Miranda. At least three strong grounds support this conclusion: Questioning a person who is already in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest; a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release; and a prisoner knows that his questioners probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence.  Thus, service of a prison term, without more, is not enough to constitute Miranda custody.  Pp.812.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The other two elements in the Sixth Circuits rule are likewise insufficient.  Taking a prisoner aside for questioning may necessitate some additional limitations on the prisoners freedom of movement, but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into Miranda custody.  Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere and may be in his best interest.  Neither does questioning a prisoner about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls.  The coercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are asked.  Pp.1213.
			

				
				
				3.When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation.  The record in this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Miranda purposes.  While some of the facts lend support to his argument that Mirandas custody requirement was met, they are offset by others.  Most important, he was told at the outset of the interrogation, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go back to his cell whenever he wanted.  Moreover, he was not physically restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, average-sized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and was offered food and water.  These facts are consistent with an environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life behind bars.  Pp.1316.
			

				617 F.3d 813, reversed.

, clearly established, 2254(d)(1), that isolation from the general prison population, combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such interrogation custodial per se.
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.This Courts precedents do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the Sixth Circuit relied.  The Court has repeatedly declined to adopt any such rule.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Perkins, 

496 U.S. 292
.  The Sixth Circuit misread Mathis, which simply held, as relevant here, that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda because he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense.  It did not hold that imprisonment alone constitutes Miranda custody.  Nor does the statement in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. ___, ___, that [n]o one questions that [inmate] Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purposes support a per se rule.  It means only that the issue of custody was not contested in that case.  Finally, contrary to respondents suggestion, Miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				2.The Sixth Circuits categorical rulethat imprisonment, questioning in private, and questioning about events in the outside world create a custodial situation for Miranda purposesis simply wrong.  Pp.813.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The initial step in determining whether a person is in Miranda custody is to ascertain, given all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, how a suspect would have gauged his freedom of movement.  Stansbury v. California, 

511 U.S. 318
.  However, not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to Miranda custody.  See, e.g., Berkemer v. McCarty, 

468 U.S. 420
.  Shatzer, distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and Miranda custody, held that a break in Miranda custody between a suspects invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment.  If a break in custody can occur, it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of Miranda. At least three strong grounds support this conclusion: Questioning a person who is already in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest; a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release; and a prisoner knows that his questioners probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence.  Thus, service of a prison term, without more, is not enough to constitute Miranda custody.  Pp.812.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The other two elements in the Sixth Circuits rule are likewise insufficient.  Taking a prisoner aside for questioning may necessitate some additional limitations on the prisoners freedom of movement, but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into Miranda custody.  Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere and may be in his best interest.  Neither does questioning a prisoner about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls.  The coercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are asked.  Pp.1213.
			

				
				
				3.When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation.  The record in this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Miranda purposes.  While some of the facts lend support to his argument that Mirandas custody requirement was met, they are offset by others.  Most important, he was told at the outset of the interrogation, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go back to his cell whenever he wanted.  Moreover, he was not physically restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, average-sized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and was offered food and water.  These facts are consistent with an environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life behind bars.  Pp.1316.

				Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.
			"|"
			Respondent, a prison inmate, sought to suppress his confession under Miranda v. Arizona after he was subjected to custodial interrogation when he was escorted from his prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room where he was questioned by two sheriff's deputies about criminal activity he had allegedly engaged in before coming to prison. The Sixth Circuit subsequently held that precedent clearly established that a prisoner was in custody within the meaning of Miranda if the prisoner was taken aside and questioned about events that occurred outside the prison walls. The Court's decision, however, did not clearly establish such a rule, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in holding that this rule provided a permissible basis for federal habeas relief under the relevant provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1). The rule applied by the lower court did not represent a correct interpretation of the Court's Miranda law. Therefore, taking into account all of the circumstances of the questioning - including especially the undisputed fact that respondent was told he was free to end the questioning and to return to his cell - the Court held that respondent was not in custody within the meaning of Miranda.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				JOHN E. WETZEL, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, etal. v. JAMES LAMBERT
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 1138.Decided February 21, 2012
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				James Lambert was convicted and sentenced to death in 1984 for the murder of two patrons during a robbery of Princes Lounge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  One of the Commonwealths primary witnesses at Lamberts trial was Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in the robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as his accomplices.  Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a claim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court, alleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose, inter alia, a police activity sheet in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 

373 U.S. 83 (1963)
.  This document, dated October 25, 1982, noted that a photo display containing a picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was shown to two witnesses to the Princes Lounge robbery, but that [n]o identification was made.  Exh. 1, App. to Brief in Opposition.  The document further noted that Mr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant by Jackson, who was in custody at the time on several charges and had admitted to involvement in at least 13 armed robberies of bars.  Ibid.  The activity sheet did not indicate whether Jacksons reference was to the Princes Lounge crime or one of the others.  The sheet bore the names of the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the Princes Lounge robbery.  It also bore the names of the robberys murder victims, as well as the police case numbers for those murders.  The Commonwealth has identified no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any other robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in any other robbery.
			

				
				
				Lambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpa-tory, because it suggested that someone other than or in addition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the Princes Lounge crime.  Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 472, 884 A.2d 848, 855 (2005).  Lambert also argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach Jacksons testimony at trial, because the statement attributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				The Commonwealth countered that the asserted statement by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact nothing more than an ambiguously worded notation.  Ibid.  The Commonwealth argued that this notation sim-ply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a co-defendant in some incident, without specifying whether Woodlock was said to be involved in the Princes Lounge robbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which  Jackson had admitted participating.  In this regard, the Commonwealth noted that Woodlocks name was not mentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial proceedings, or Jacksons statements about the Princes Lounge robbery.  As the Commonwealth has put it, it seems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a participant in one of his many other robberies, and police simply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with this case.  Reply to Brief in Opposition 2.  The Commonwealth further note[d] that the document would not have advanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had already been extensively impeached at trial.  Lambert, 584 Pa., at 472, 884 A.2d, at 855.  Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the ambiguous reference to Woodlock would not have discredited Jackson any further.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lamberts Brady claim, holding that the disputed document was not material.  Id., at 472473, 848 A.2d, at 855856.  The court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the result of Lamberts trial would have been different had the document been disclosed.  Ibid.  See Strickler v. Greene, 

527 U. S. 263, 
281 (1999)
.  Calling Lamberts claim that the reference to Woodlock automatically meant someone else was involved in the Princes Lounge robbery purely speculative at best, the court noted that the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.  584 Pa., at 473, 884 A.2d, at 855.  Moreover, the court continued, the document would not have materially furthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was already extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and Reese.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 
28 U.S.C. 2254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealths failure to disclose the document violated his rights under Brady.  The District Court denied the writ, holding that the state courts determination that the notations were not exculpatory or impeaching was reasonable.  Lambert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 029034 (July 24, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36.  The court explained that [t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert] claims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-tirely ambiguous, and would have required the state courts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for Lambert and material to his guilt or punishment.  Id., at 36.
			

				
				
				On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and granted the writ.  633 F. 3d 126 (2011).  The Third Circuit concluded that it was patently unreasonable for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to presume that whenever a witness is impeached in one manner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-material.  Id., at 134.  According to the Third Circuit, the notation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a co-defendant would have opened an entirely new line of impeachment because the prosecutor at trial had relied on the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert as the third participant in the robbery.  Id., at 135.  The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.
			

				
				
				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state courts adjudication of his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  
28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Under 2254(d), a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state courts decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).
			

				
				
				In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the determination of the state courts that the notations were, as the District Court put it, not exculpatory or impeaching but instead entirely ambiguous.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36.  Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on the alternative ground that any impeachment value that might have been obtained from the notations would have been cumulative.  If the conclusion in the state courts about the content of the document was reasonablenot necessarily correct, but reasonablewhatever those courts had to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would be beside the point.  The failure of the Third Circuit even to address the ambiguous nature of the notations, and the speculat[ive] nature of Lamberts reading of them, is especially surprising, given that this was the basis of the District Court ruling.  Id., at 36.
				[
					1
				]
				
			

				
				
				The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of capital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the Commonwealth retried him within 120 days.  It did so because of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a co-defendant, and bearing other information associating the sheet with the Princes Lounge robbery.  The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address the state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was ambiguous and any connection to the Princes Lounge robbery speculative.  That rulingon which we do not now opinemay well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity sheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Princes Lounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other such robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several charges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Woodlocks name appeared nowhere else in the Princes Lounge files, and (5) the two witnesses from the Princes Lounge robbery who were shown Woodlocks photo did not identify him as involved in that crime.
			

				
				
				Any retrial here would take place three decades after the crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prosecution.  That burden should not be imposed unless each ground supporting the state court decision is examined and found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.
			

				
				
				The petition for certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 
9 U.S.C. 1 etseq., with respect to all arbitration agreements covered by that statute.  Here, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading and disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting the FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implementing that basic principle.  The state court held unenforce- able all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.
			

				
				
				The decision of the state court found the FAAs coverage to be more limited than mandated by this Courts previous cases.  The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals must be vacated.  When this Court has fulfilled its duty to interpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or fail to implement the rule so established.  See U.S. Const., Art.VI, cl. 2.
			

				I
			

				
				
				This litigation involves three negligence suits against nursing homes in West Virginia.  The suits were brought by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.  In each case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the patient.  The relevant parts of the agreements in Browns case and Taylors case were identical.  The contracts included a clause requiring the parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to col- lect late payments owed by the patient.  The contracts included a provision holding the party filing the arbitration responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee schedules.  The agreement in Marchios case also included a clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to the arbitration requirement and did not mention filing fees.
			

				
				
				In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in death.  A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown and Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate.  The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated those cases with Marchios, which was before the court on other issues.
			

				
				
				In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court held that as a matter of public policy under West Virginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.  Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp., No. 35494 (W.Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.11391, pp. 85a86a (hereinafter Pet. App.).  The state court considered whether the state public policy was pre-empted by the FAA.  The state court found unpersuasive this Courts interpretation of the FAA, calling it tendentious, id., at 51a, and created from whole cloth, id., at 53a.  It later concluded that Congress did not intend for the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal injury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive from a written agreement that evidences a transaction affecting interstate commerce, particularly where the agreement involves a service that is a practical necessity for members of the public, id., at 84a.  The court thus concluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub- lic policy against predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.
			

				
				
				The West Virginia courts interpretation of the FAA was both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court.  The FAA provides that a written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.  
9 U.S.C. 2.  The statutes text includes no exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.  It requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to arbitrate.  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 

470 U.S. 213, 
217 (1985)
.  It reflects an emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.  KPMG LLP v. Cocchi, 565 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 

473 U.S. 614, 
631 (1985)
; internal quotation marks omitted).
			

				
				
				As this Court reaffirmed last Term, [w]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.  AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 67).  That rule resolves these cases.  West Virginias prohibition against predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate- gorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the FAA.  See ibid.  See also, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 

552 U.S. 346, 
356 (2008)
 (FAA pre-empts state law granting state commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue the parties agreed to arbitrate); Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 

514 U.S. 52, 
56 (1995)
 (FAA pre-empts state law requiring judicial resolution of claims involving punitive damages); Perry v. Thomas, 

482 U.S. 483, 
491 (1987)
 (FAA pre-empts state-law requirement that litigants be provided a judicial forum for wage disputes); Southland Corp. v. Keating, 

465 U.S. 1, 
10 (1984)
 (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statutes prohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that statute).
			

				II
			

				
				
				The West Virginia court proposed an alternativ[e] hold- ing that the particular arbitration clauses in Browns case and Taylors case were unconscionable.  Pet. App. 89a91a, 94a.  See also id., at 98a (not addressing the question whether the arbitration agreement in Marchios case is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).  It is unclear, however, to what degree the state courts alternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute arbitration agreements.  For example, in its discussion of the alternative holding, the state court found the arbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute arbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes clearly violates public policy.  Id., at 91a.
			

				
				
				On remand, the West Virginia court must consider whether, absent that general public policy, the arbitration clauses in Browns case and Taylors case are unenforce- able under state common law principles that are not specific to arbitration and pre-empted by the FAA.

				No. 101259.Argued November 8, 2011Decided January 23, 2012
			

				The Government obtained a search warrant permitting it to install a Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle registered to respondent Joness wife.  The warrant authorized installation in the District of Columbia and within 10 days, but agents installed the device on the 11th day and in Maryland.  The Government then tracked the vehicles movements for 28 days.  It subsequently secured an indictment of Jones and others on drug trafficking conspiracy charges.  The District Court suppressed the GPS data obtained while the vehicle was parked at Joness residence, but held the remaining data admissible because Jones had no reasonable expectation of privacy when the vehicle was on public streets.  Jones was convicted.  The D.C. Circuit reversed, concluding that admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device violated the 
 
Fourth Amendment.
			

				Held:The Governments attachment of the GPS device to the vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicles movements, constitutes a search under the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Pp.312.
			

				
				
				(a)The 
 
Fourth Amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Here, the Governments physical intrusion on an effect for the purpose of obtaining information constitutes a search.  This type of encroachment on an area enumerated in the Amendment would have been considered a search within the meaning of the Amendment at the time it was adopted.  Pp.34.
			

				
				
				(b)This conclusion is consistent with this Courts 
 
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, which until the latter half of the 20th century was tied to common-law trespass.  Later cases, which have deviated from that exclusively property-based approach, have applied the analysis of Justice Harlans concurrence in Katz v. United States, 

389 U.S. 347
, which said that the 
 
Fourth Amendment protects a persons reasonable expectation of privacy, id., at 360.  Here, the Court need not address the Governments contention that Jones had no reasonable expectation of privacy, because Joness 
 
Fourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.  At bottom, the Court must assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the 
 
Fourth Amendment was adopted.  Kyllo v. United States,

The District Court suppressed GPS data from a vehicle parked outside of respondent's residence, but held the remaining data admissible because respondent had no reasonable expectation of privacy when the vehicle was on a public street. The D.C. Circuit reversed, concluding that admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court held that the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment.

				The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 
21 U.S.C. 601 et seq., regulates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure the safety of meat and the humane handling of animals.  The Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which administers the FMIA, has issued extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses operations and facilities.  See 9 CFR 300.1 etseq.  The FSIS inspection procedure begins with an ante-mortem inspection of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse.  If, at that inspection, a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly severe disease or condition, it must be classified as U.S. Condemned and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food is produced.  309.3, 311.1 et seq.  Nonambulatory animals that are not condemned are classified as U.S. Suspect.  309.2(b).  They are set apart, specially monitored, and slaughtered separately from other livestock. 309.2(n).  Following slaughter, an inspector decides at a post-mortem examination which parts, if any, of the suspect animals carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts. 310, 311.  FSIS regulations additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process, 9 CFR pt. 313, including specific provisions for the humane treatment of nonambulatory animals, 9 CFR 313.2(d).
			

				
				
				
				
				The FMIAs preemption clause, 678, precludes states from imposing requirements that are within the scope of the FMIA, relate to slaughterhouse premises, facilities and operations, and are in addition to, or different than those made under the FMIA.  In 2008, California amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse shall buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal; process, butcher, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human  consumption; or hold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.  599f(a)(c).  Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA), a trade association representing meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of 599f against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the FMIA preempts application of the state law.  The District Court agreed, and granted the NMA a preliminary injunction.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that 599f is not preempted because it regulates only the kind of animal that may be slaughtered, not the inspection or slaughtering process itself. 
			

				Held:The FMIA expressly preempts 599fs application against federally inspected swine slaughterhouses.  Pp. 614.
			

				
				
				(a)The FMIAs preemption clause sweeps widely, and so blocks the applications of 599f challenged here.  The clause prevents a State from imposing any additional or differenteven if nonconflictingrequirements that fall within the FMIAs scope and concern slaughterhouse facilities or operations.  Section 599f imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses:  Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.  For example, when a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse, 599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from hold[ing] the pig without immediately euthanizing it; and 599f(b) prohibits the slaughterhouse from process[ing] or butcher[ing] the animal to make food.  By contrast, the FMIA and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory animal that has not been condemned, and to process and butcher such an animals meat, subject to an FSIS officials approval at post-mortem inspection.  Similarly, when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, 599f(a) prohibits a slaughterhouse from receiv[ing] or buy[ing] the pig.  But the FMIA and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to purchase nonambulatory pigs. See 
21 U.S.C. 644; 9 CFR 325.20(c).  And the FSIS inspection regime clearly contemplates that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals.  So 599f substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the FMIA prescribes. 
			

				
				
				Respondent Humane Society argues that 599f(a)s ban on purchasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse premises.  But the record does not disclose whether 599f(a) ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application of that kind would affect a slaughterhouses operations.  Moreover, even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIAs preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse premises, facilities and operations.  And while the Humane Society is correct that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activities, 599fs sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises.  Its effect is to make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process.  It is therefore preempted by the FMIA.  Pp. 610.  
			

				
				
				(b)Also rejected is the broad argument that 599fs challenged provisions fall outside the FMIAs scope because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only to animals that are going to be turned into meat.  In fact, the FMIA regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be turned into meat. For example, the Acts implementing regulations exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g., swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR 309.5(a).  The argument that 599fs exclusion avoids the FMIAs scope because it is designed to ensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunderstands the FMIAs scope.  The FMIA addresses not just food safety, but humane treatment, as well.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 603, 610(b).  Pp. 1114.

			Petitioner, a trade association representing meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of a California law against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U.S.C. 601, et seq., preempted application of the law. The California law dictated what slaughterhouses must do with pigs that could not walk, known in the trade as nonambulatory pigs. The Court concluded that the FMIA regulated slaughterhouses' handling and treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their delivery through the end of the meat production process. California's law endeavored to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the same place - except by imposing different requirements. The FMIA expressly preempted such a state law. Accordingly, the Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remanded for further proceedings.

				The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Act) requires convicted sex offenders to provide state governments with, and to update, information, e.g., names and current addresses, for state and federal sex offender registries.  It is a crime if a person who is required to register under [the Act] and who travels in interstate ... commerce knowingly fails to register or update a registration.  
18 U.S.C. 2250(a).  The Act defines sex offender to include offenders who were convicted before the Acts effective date, 
42 U.S.C. 16911(1), and says that the Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements to pre-Act offenders, 16913(d).  The Act, which seeks to make more uniform and effective a patchwork of pre-Act federal and 50 state registration systems, became law in July 2006.  In February 2007, the Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act applies to all pre-Act offenders.  He has since promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Reynolds, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in 2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania.  He was indicted for failing to meet the Acts registration requirements between September 16 and October 16, 2007.  He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Act was not applicable to pre-Act offenders during that time, arguing that the Attorney Generals February 2007 Interim Rule was invalid because it violated the Constitutions nondelegation doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Acts notice and comment requirements.  The District Court rejected on the merits of Reynolds legal attack on the Interim Rule, but the Third Circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits, concluding that the Acts registration requirements applied to pre-Act offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General.  Thus, it found, the Interim Rules validity made no legal difference in the outcome.
			

				Held:The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specifies that the Acts registration provisions apply to them.  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				(a)This conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the Acts text, which consists of four statements.  Statement One says that [a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.  Statement Two says that, generally, the offender must initially register before completing his sentence of imprisonment.  Statement Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of name, residence, employment, or student status.  Statement Four says that [t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements ... to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of the Act.  16913.  Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.  It deals specifically with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of the First Statements broad general class (all sex offenders) and thus should control the Acts application to that subset.  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 

498 U.S. 395
.  Also, by giving the Attorney General authority to specify the Acts applicability, not its nonapplicability, the Fourth Statement is more naturally read to confer authority to apply the Act, not authority to make exceptions.  This reading efficiently resolves what may have been Congress concern about the practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a large number of pre-Act offenders, which could have been expensive and might not have proved feasible to do immediately.  It might have thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for different categories of pre-Act offenders.  And it could have concluded that it was efficient and desirable to ask the Justice Department, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine pre-Act offender problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly.  This reading also takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic criminal law principles.  The Second Statement, e.g., requires a sex offender to register before completing his prison term, but says nothing about when a pre-Act offender who has left prison is to register.  An Attorney General ruling could diminish such uncertainties, helping to eliminate the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(b)The Governments three principal contrary argumentsthat the Courts reading conflicts with the Acts purpose of establishing a national registration system that includes pre-Act offenders; that the Courts reading could lead to an absurdly long implementation delay; and that the Act should be read to apply the requirements immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders to avoid the possibility that the Attorney General, who has, but is not required to use, the authority to specify requirements, might take no actionare unpersuasive.  Some lower courts have read the Attorney Generals authority to apply only to pre-Act sex offenders who are unable to comply with the statutes initial registration requirements, but that is not what the Act says.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(c)Because the Acts registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General so specifies, the question whether the Attorney Generals Interim Rule is a valid specification matters in this case.  P.13.

Petitioner, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in 2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania. The question before the Court was the date on which the federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders convicted before the Act became law. The Court held that the Act did not require pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specified that the Act's registration provisions applied to them. Accordingly, the Court reversed a Court of Appeals determination that, in effect, held the contrary.

				DARIN RYBURN, etal. v. GEORGE R. HUFF, etal.
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11208.Decided January 23, 2012
			

				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Petitioners Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zepeda, along with two other officers from the Burbank Police Department, responded to a call from Bellarmine-Jefferson High School in Burbank, California.  When the officers arrived at the school, the principal informed them that a stu- dent, Vincent Huff, was rumored to have written a letter threatening to shoot up the school.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2.  The principal reported that many parents, after hearing the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home.  Ibid.  The principal expressed concern for the safety of her students and requested that the officers investigate the threat.  Id., at 42, 5455.
			

				
				
				In the course of conducting interviews with the principal and two of Vincents classmates, the officers learned that Vincent had been absent from school for two days and that he was frequently subjected to bullying.  Id., at 2.  The officers additionally learned that one of Vincents classmates believed that Vincent was capable of carrying out the alleged threat.  Id., at 44.  The officers found Vincents absences from school and his history of being subjected to bullying as cause for concern.  The officers had received training on targeted school violence and were aware that these characteristics are common among perpetrators of school shootings.  Id., at 5658, 63.
			

				
				
				The officers decided to continue the investigation by interviewing Vincent.  When the officers arrived at Vincents house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and announced several times that the officers were with the Burbank Police Department.  No one answered the door or otherwise responded to Officer Zepedas knocks.  Sergeant Ryburn then called the home telephone.  The officers could hear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one answered.  Id., at 2.
			

				
				
				Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of Vincents mother, Mrs. Huff.  When Mrs. Huff answered the phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and inquired about her location.  Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant Ryburn that she was inside the house.  Sergeant Ryburn then inquired about Vincents location, and Mrs. Huff informed him that Vincent was inside with her.  Sergeant Ryburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were outside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff hung up the phone.  Id., at 23.
			

				
				
				One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and Vincent walked out of the house and stood on the front steps.  Officer Zepeda advised Vincent that he and the other officers were there to discuss the threats.  Vincent, apparently aware of the rumor that was circulating at his school, responded, I cant believe youre here for that.  Id., at 3.  Sergeant Ryburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discussion inside the house, but she refused.  Ibid.  In Sergeant Ryburns experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was extremely unusual for a parent to decline an officers request to interview a juvenile inside.  Id., at 3, 7374.  Sergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never asked the officers the reason for their visit.  Id., at 7374.
			

				
				
				After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburns request to continue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her if there were any guns in the house.  Mrs. Huff responded by immediately turn[ing] around and r[unning] into the house.  Id., at 3.  Sergeant Ryburn, who was scared because [he] didnt know what was in that house and had seen too many officers killed, entered the house behind her.  Id., at 75.  Vincent entered the house behind Sergeant Ryburn, and Officer Zepeda entered after Vincent.  Officer Zepeda was concerned about officer safety and did not want Sergeant Ryburn to enter the house alone.  Id., at 3.  The two remaining officers, who had been standing out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda talked to Vincent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house last, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter.  Id., at 34.
			

				
				
				Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the living room with Mrs. Huff and Vincent.  Eventually, Vincents father entered the room and challenged the officers authority to be there.  The officers remained in-side the house for a total of 5 to 10 minutes.  During that time, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and Vincent.  They did not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or Vincent, or any of their property.  The officers ultimately concluded that the rumor about Vincent was false, and they reported their conclusion to the school.  Id., at 4.
			

				
				
				The Huffs brought this action against the officers under Rev. Stat. 1979, 
42 U.S.C. 1983.  The complaint alleges that the officers violated the Huffs 
 
Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home without a warrant.  Following a 2-day bench trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the officers.  The District Court resolved conflicting testimony regarding Mrs. Huffs response to Sergeant Ryburns inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs. Huff immediately turned around and ran into the house.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3.  The District Court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because Mrs. Huffs odd behavior, combined with the information the officers gathered at the school, could have led reason-able officers to believe that there could be weapons inside the house, and that family members or the officers themselves were in danger.  Id., at 6.  The District Court noted that [w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were confronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to grave concern about the nature of the danger they were confronting.  Id., at 67.  With respect to this kind of rapidly evolving incident, the District Court explained, courts should be especially reluctant to fault the police for not obtaining a warrant.  Id., at 7.
			

				
				
				A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the two officers who entered the house on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but reversed as to petitioners.  The majority upheld the District Courts findings of fact, but disagreed with the District Courts conclusion that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity.  The majority acknowledged that police officers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if they reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary to protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if the officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is about to be committed.  Id., at 24.  But the majority determined that, in this case, any belief that the officers or other family members were in serious, im-minent harm would have been objectively unreasonable given that [Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home.  Id., at 25.
			

				
				
				Judge Rawlinson dissented.  She explained that the discrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case was Mrs. Huffs response to the question regarding whether there were guns in the house.  Id., at 31.  She faulted the majority for recit[ing] a sanitized account of this event that differed markedly from the District Courts findings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be credited.  Judge Rawlinson looked to cases that specifi- cally address the scenario where officer safety concerns prompted the entry and concluded that, under the rationale articulated in those cases, a police officer could have reasonably believed that he was justified in making a warrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house had a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without answering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.  Id., at 31, 33, 37.
			

				
				
				Judge Rawlinsons analysis of the qualified immunity issue was correct.  No decision of this Court has found a 
 
Fourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly comparable to those present in this case.  On the contrary, some of our opinions may be read as pointing in the opposition direction.
			

				
				
				In Brigham City v. Stuart, 

547 U.S. 398, 
400 (2006)
, we held that officers may enter a residence without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is ... imminently threatened with [serious injury].  We explained that [t]he need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.  Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 

437 U.S. 385, 
392 (1978)
).  In addition, in Georgia v. Randolph, 

547 U.S. 103, 
118 (2006)
, the Court stated that it would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering [a residence] ... to determine whether violence ... is about to (or soon will) occur.
			

				
				
				A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to mean that the 
 
Fourth Amendment permits an officer to en- ter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.  In this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners had such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such a conclusion.  The District Court wrote:
			

				[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led them to be concerned for their own safety and for the safety of other persons in the residence:  the unusual behavior of the parents in not answering the door or the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire about the reason for their visit or express concern that they were investigating her son; the fact that she hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that she refused to tell them whether there were guns in the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into the house while being questioned.  That behavior, combined with the information obtained at the schoolthat Vincent was a student who was a victim of bullying, who had been absent from school for two days, and who had threatened to shoot up the schoolled the officers to believe that there could be weapons inside the house, and that family members or the officers themselves were in danger.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6.
			

				This belief, the District Court held, was objectively reasonable, particularly since the situation was rapidly evolving and the officers had to make quick decisions.  Id., at 67.
			

				
				
				The panel majorityfar removed from the scene and with the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situationconfidently concluded that the officers really had no reason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else.  As the panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the Huffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the door and announced their presence and when they called the home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation to respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.  The majority attributed no significance to the fact that, when the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell phone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conversation.  And, according to the majority, the officers should not have been concerned by Mrs. Huffs reaction when they asked her if there were any guns in the house because Mrs. Huff merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home.  Id., at 25.
			

				
				
				Confronted with the facts found by the District Court, reasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have come to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat to their safety and to the safety of others.  The Ninth Circuits contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous reasons.
			

				
				
				First, although the panel majority purported to accept the findings of the District Court, it changed those findings in several key respects.  As Judge Rawlinson correctly observed, the discrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case was Mrs. Huffs response to the question regarding whether there were guns in the house.  Id., at 31.  The District Courts finding that Mrs. Huff immediately turned around and ran into the house implicitly rejected Mrs. Huffs contrary testimony that she walked into the house after telling the officers that she was going to get her husband.  Id., at 3.  The panel majority upheld the District Courts findings of fact and acknowledged that it could not reverse the District Court simply because it may have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and other evidence in another manner.  Id., at 15.  But the panel majoritys determination that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of the facts that differed markedly from the District Courts finding.  According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home after telling the officers that she would go get her husband.  Id., at 12, 25.
			

				
				
				Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the view that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of concern so long as it is lawful.  Accordingly, the panel ma- jority concluded that Mrs. Huffs response to the question whether there were any guns in the house (immediately turning around and running inside) was not a reason for alarm because she was under no legal obligation to continue her conversation with the police.  It should go without saying, however, that there are many circumstances in which lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.
			

				
				
				Third, the panel majoritys method of analyzing the string of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was entirely unrealistic.  The majority looked at each separate event in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did not give cause for concern.  But it is a matter of common sense that a combination of events each of which is mundane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming picture.
			

				
				
				Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District Courts wise admonition that judges should be cautious about second-guessing a police officers assessment, made on the scene, of the danger presented by a particular situation.  With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliberation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreasonable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent.  But we have instructed that reasonableness must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight and that [t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgmentsin circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.  Graham v. Connor, 

490 U.S. 386
397 (1989).  Judged from the proper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a split-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding chain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning and running into the house after refusing to answer a question about guns, petitioners belief that entry was necessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was im- minently reasonable.
			

				
				
				In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners position could have come to the conclusion that the 
 
Fourth Amendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that violence was imminent.  And a reasonable officer could have come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found by the District Court.
			

				
				
				The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.
			

				
It is so ordered.

				appeal from the united states district court for the western district of texas
			

				[January 20, 2012]
			

				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				The 2010 census showed an enormous increase in Texas population, with over four million new residents.  That growth required the State to redraw its electoral districts for the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the State House of Representatives, in order to comply with the Constitutions one-person, one-vote rule.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 

539 U.S. 461
, n.2 (2003).  The State also had to create new districts for the four additional congressional seats it received.
			

				
				
				Texas is a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  See 

79Stat.
439, 
42 U.S.C. 1973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011).  Section 5 suspends all changes to a covered jurisdictions election procedures, including district lines, until those changes are submitted to and approved by a three-judge United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney General.  See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.  One v. Holder, 

557 U.S. 193, 
198 (2009)
.  This process, known as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction  to demonstrate that its proposed change neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.  1973c(a).  This Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map cannot be used to conduct an election until it has been precleared.  See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 

500 U.S. 646, 
652 (1991)
.
			

				
				
				The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas submitted them to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for preclearance.  The preclearance process remains ongoing.  Texas was unsuccessful in its bid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the coming weeks.  Meanwhile, various plaintiffsappellees herebrought suit in Texas, claiming that the States newly enacted plans violate the United States Constitution and 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
				[
					1
				]
				  Appellees alleged, inter alia, that Texas enacted plans discriminate against Latinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting strength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and  African-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas population growth since 2000.  A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas was convened.  See 
28 U.S.C. 2284.  That court heard argument and held a trial with respect to the plaintiffs claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution  of the preclearance process in the D.C. court.  Cf. Branch v. Smith, 

538 U.S. 254
285 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring).
			

				
				
				As Texas 2012 primaries approached, it became increasingly likely that the States newly enacted plans would not receive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections.  And the States old district lines could not be used, because population growth had rendered them inconsistent with the Constitutions one-person, one-vote requirement.  It thus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim plans for the States 2012 primaries and elections.  See Connor v. Finch, 

431 U.S. 407
415 (1977).  After receiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive hearings, that court issued its interim plans.  The court unanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but Judge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional and State House plans.  Texas asked this Court to stay the interim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were unnecessarily inconsistent with the States enacted plans.  This Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdiction.  565 U.S. ___ (2011).
			

				
				
				Redistricting is primarily the duty and responsibility  of the State.  Chapman v. Meier, 

420 U.S. 1, 
27 (1975)
.  The failure of a States newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by  itself, require a court to take up the state legislatures task.  That is because, in most circumstances, the States last enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan receives preclearance.  But if an intervening eventmost commonly, as here, a censusrenders the current plan unusable, a court must undertake the unwelcome obligation of creating an interim plan.  Connor, supra, at 415.  Even then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient structure to the courts endeavor.  Where shifts in a States population have been relatively small, a court may need to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the States existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.
			

				
				
				But here the scale of Texas population growth appears to require sweeping changes to the States current districts.  In areas where population shifts are so large that no semblance of the existing plans district lines can be used, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an interim map.  The problem is perhaps most obvious in adding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no suggestion as to where those new districts should be placed.  In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of defining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment.  See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 

515 U.S. 900
916 (1995); White v. Weiser, 

412 U.S. 783
796 (1973).  Thus, if the old state districts were the only source to which a district court could look, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judgments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.
			

				
				
				To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise standardless decisions, a district court should take guidance from the States recently enacted plan in drafting an interim plan.  That plan reflects the States policy judgments on where to place new districts and how to shift existing ones in response to massive population growth.  This Court has observed before that faced with the necessity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a general rule, should be guided by the legislative policies underlying a state planeven one that was itself unenforceableto the extent those policies do not lead to violations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.  Abrams v. Johnson, 

521 U.S. 74, 
79 (1997)
 (holding that the District Court properly declined to defer to a precleared plan that used race as a predominant factor).  For example, in White, supra, an equal population challenge, this Court reversed a District Courts choice of interim plan, and required the District Court to choose a plan more closely resembling an enacted state plan, even though the state plan itself had been held to violate the one-person, one-vote principle.  Similarly, in Upham v. Seamon, although the state plan as a whole had been denied 5 preclearance, this Court directed a District Court to defer to the legislative judgments the [state] plans reflect, insofar as they involved districts found to meet the preclearance standard.  

456 U.S. 37
41 (1982) (percuriam).  See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 

403 U.S. 124
161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).
			

				
				
				Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented if it has not been precleared.  But that does not mean that the plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it reflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an interim plan.  On the contrary, the state plan serves as a starting point for the district court.  It provides important guidance that helps ensure that the district court appropriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that comply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, without displacing legitimate state policy judgments with the courts own preferences.
			

				
				
				A district court making such use of a States plan must, of course, take care not to incorporate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state plan.  See Abrams, supra, at 8586; White, supra, at 797.  Where a States plan faces challenges under the Constitution or 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by that plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on the merits.  Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must normally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to that law.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

555 U.S. 7, 
20 (2008)
.  There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat the policies behind a States redistricting legislation should not also have to meet that standard.  And because the local district courthere, the District Court for the Western District of Texaswill ultimately decide the merits of claims under 2 and the Constitution, it is well equipped to apply that familiar standard.
			

				
				
				The calculus with respect to 5 challenges is somewhat different.  Where a State has sought preclearance in the District Court for the District of Columbia, 5 allows only that court to determine whether the state plan complies with 5.  Consistent with that design, we have made clear that other district courts may not address the merits of 5 challenges.  See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 

400 U.S. 379, 
385 (1971)
.  The local district court drafting an interim plan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits of the preclearance proceedings.  The court should presume neither that a States effort to preclear its plan will succeed nor that it will fail.
			

				
				
				The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance is satisfied by taking guidance from a States policy judgments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain 5 preclearance.  And by reasonable probability this Court means in this context that the 5 challenge is not insubstantial.  That standard ensures that a district court is not deprived of important guidance provided by a state plan due to 5 challenges that have no reasonable probability of success but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative of those responsible for the preclearance determination.  And the reasonable probability standard adequately balances the unique preclearance scheme with the States sovereignty and a district courts need for policy guidance in constructing an interim map.  This Court recently noted the serious constitutional questions raised by 5s intrusion on state sovereignty.  Northwest Austin, 557 U.S., at 204.  Those concerns would only be exacerbated if 5 required a district court to wholly ignore the States policies in drawing maps that will govern a States elections, without any reason to believe those state policies are unlawful.
			

				
				
				Appellees, however, contend that 5 demands exactly that.  In their view, this Courts precedents require district courts to ignore any state plan that has not received 5 preclearance.  But the cases upon which appellees rely hold only that a district court may not adopt an unprecleared plan as its own.  See Lopez v. Monterey County, 

519 U.S. 9 (1996)
; McDaniel v. Sanchez, 

452 U.S. 130 (1981)
.  They say nothing about whether a district court may take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in such a plan for aid in drawing an interim map.  Indeed, in Upham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the unobjectionable aspects of a States plan even though that plan had already been denied preclearance.
			

				
				
				In this case, the District Court stated that it had giv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the Legislatures enacted map as possible.  1 App. 182.  At the same time, however, the court said that it was required to draw an independent map following neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good.  Id., at 169170.  In the courts view, it was not required to give any deference to the Legislatures enacted plan, and it instead applied principles that it determined place the interests of the citizens of Texas first.  Id., at 171.  To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission to draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept of the collective public good for the Texas Legislatures determination of which policies serve the interests of the citizens of Texas, the court erred.
			

				
				
				In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map without regard to political considerations, the District Court relied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001) (percuriam), summarily affd, 

536 U.S. 919 (2002)
.  1 App. 182.  But in Balderas there was no recently enacted state plan to which the District Court could turn.  Without the benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly legislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was perhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own notion of the public good.  Because the District Court here had the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the court had neither the need nor the license to cast aside that vital aid.
			

				
				
				Some specific aspects of the District Courts plans seem to pay adequate attention to the States policies, others do not, and the propriety of still others is unclear.  For example, in drawing State House districts in North and East Texas, the District Court closely followed the States policies.  See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 2526.  Although Texas entire State House plan is challenged in the 5 proceedings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the district lines in North and East Texas have a discriminatory intent or effect.  1 id., at 187, n.4.  The District Court was thus correct to take guidance from the States plan in drawing the interim map for those regions.  But the court then altered those districts to achieve de minimis population variationseven though there was no claim that the population variations in those districts were unlawful.  Id., at 171, and n.8.  In the absence of any legal flaw in this respect in the States plan, the District Court had no basis to modify that plan.
				[
					2
				]
				
			

				
				
				The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting precincts (called voter tabulation districts in Texas) in drawing the interim plans.  Id., at 90, 102103.  That choice alone prevented the District Court from following the lead of Texas enacted planwhich freely splits precinctsin many areas where there were no legal chal-lenges to the plans details.  See id., at 102103, 116, n. 24.  The District Court was apparently motivated by a well-intentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of reconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the courts interim plan could be implemented in time for the upcoming election.  Id., at 90, 102103, 109.  But the States plan accepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accomplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting precincts when redistricting.  See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. 42.032 (West 2010).  If a State has chosen to accept the burden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so is otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court to ignore the States decision.  Of course, in this case it may well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light of the exigencies caused by the impending election.
			

				
				
				The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily ignored the States plans in drawing certain individual districts.  For example, the District Court drew an interim District 77 that resembles neither the States newly enacted plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010 census.  The court said that it did so in response to alleged constitutional violations.  1 App. 174175.  But the court did not say that those allegations were plausible, much less likely to succeed.  Nor did the District Court rely on a finding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a reasonable probability of failing to gain 5 preclearance, see supra, at 6.  Without such a determination, the District Court had no basis for drawing a district that does not resemble any legislatively enacted plan.
			

				
				
				The courts approach in drawing other districts was unclear.  The interim plans Congressional District 33, for example, disregards aspects of the States plan that appear to be subject to strong challenges in the 5 proceeding.  See 3 id., at 600601; 5 id., at 1214.  That much seems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with the path the District Court followed from there.  The courts order suggests that it may have intentionally drawn District 33 as a minority coalition opportunity district in which the court expected two different minority groups to band together to form an electoral majority.   1 id., at 147.  The order is somewhat ambiguous on this pointsome portions suggest that the court deliberately designed such a district, other parts suggest that it drew the district solely as a response to population growth in the area.  Compare id., at 146147 (Because much of the growth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex was attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district), with id., at 144 (The Court has nowhere expressly sought to increase the performance of any opportunity district above benchmark).  If the District Court did set out to create a minority coalition district, rather than drawing a district that simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for doing so.  Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 

556 U.S. 1
15 (2009) (plurality opinion).
			

				
				
				Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elections, the orders implementing those maps are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				
				
				The judgment shall issue forthwith.
			

				It is so ordered.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 101195.Argued November 28, 2011Decided January 18, 2012
			

				Consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technologyfor example, computerized calls to private homesprompted Congress to pass the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 
47 U.S.C. 227.  Congress determined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.  The Act bans certain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regulations.  It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and recover damages on their residents behalf, 
47 U.S.C. A. 227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U.S. district courts, 227(g)(2).  It also permits a private person to seek redress for violations of the Act or regulations in an appropriate court of [a] State, if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [that] State.  47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3), (c)(5).
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court, alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mimss cellular phone without his consent.  Mims invoked the courts federal question jurisdiction, i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims arising under the ... laws ... of the United States, 
28 U.S.C. 1331.  The District Court, affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mimss complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested jurisdiction over private actions exclusively in state courts.
			

				Held:The TCPAs permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does not deprive the U.S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.  Pp.718.
			

				
				
				(a)Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the rules of decision, Mimss TCPA claim, in 1331s words, plainly aris[es] under the laws ... of the United States.  Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in state courts.  In cases arising under federal law, there is a presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.  Tafflin v. Levitt, 

493 U.S. 455
459.  Arrow acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that 1331 creates no converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction.  Instead, Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces 1331, an earlier, more general prescription.  
			

				
				
				Section 1331 is not swept away so easily.  The principle that district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under 1331 when federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal courts of their 1331 adjudicatory authority.  See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 

535 U.S. 635
.  Accordingly, the District Court retains 1331 jurisdiction over Mimss complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication.  See id., at 644.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				(b)Arrows arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress eliminated 1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions.  Title 
47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3)s language may be state-court oriented, but the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive, United States v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., 

296 U.S. 463
.  Nothing in 227(b)(3)s permissive language makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to oust federal courts of their 1331 jurisdiction.  The provision does not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action only or exclusively in state court.  In contrast, 
47 U.S.C. A. 227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011) vests exclusive jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA suits in the federal courts.  Section 227(g)(2)s exclusivity prescription reinforce[s] the conclusion that [
47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3)s] silence ... leaves the jurisdictional grant of 1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Verizon Md., 535 U.S., at 644.  
			

				
				
				Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private action in an appropriate [state] court, 227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have concurrent jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all.  But, as already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court jurisdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state authorities, see 
47 U.S.C. A. 227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was also exclusive for private actions.  Moreover, by providing that private actions may be brought in state court if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [the] State, 
47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3), Congress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to decide whether to entertain TCPA claims.
			

				
				
				Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over 227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress objective of enabling States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded state law.  Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 
28 U.S.C. 1331 should hold firm against mere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 

424 U.S. 800
, n.15.  Furthermore, had Congress sought only to fill a gap in the States enforcement capabilities, it could have provided that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be subject to the receiving States laws.  Instead, Congress enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.  
			

				
				
				Arrows reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPAs sponsor, is misplaced.  The remarks nowhere mention federal-court jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 
47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3) is intended to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims.  Even if Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to proceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this Courts judgment on 1331s compass.  Arrows arguments that federal courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.  Pp.1018.
			

				421 Fed. Appx. 920, reversed and remanded.

At issue was whether Congress' provision for private actions to enforce the TCPA rendered state courts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. The Court found no convincing reason to read into the TCPA's permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the U.S. district courts' exercise of the general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed since 1875. Therefore, the Court held that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the TCPA.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 10545.Argued October 5, 2011Decided January 18, 2012
			

				The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne), which took effect in 1886, is the principal accord governing international copyright relations.  Bernes 164 member states agree to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.  Of central importance in this case, Article 18 of Berne requires countries to protect the works of other member states unless the works copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is claimed or the country of origin.  A different system of transnational copyright protection long prevailed in this country.  Throughout most of the 20th century, the only foreign authors eligible for Copyright Act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to American authors and whose works were printed in the United States.  Despite Article 18, when the United States joined Berne in 1989, it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the U.S. public domain, many of them works never protected here.  In 1994, however, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights mandated implementation of Bernes first 21 articles, on pain of enforcement by the World Trade Organization.
			

				
				
				
				
				In response, Congress applied the term of protection available to U.S. works to preexisting works from Berne member countries.  Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) grants copyright protection to works protected in their country of origin, but lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had not complied with certain U.S. statutory formalities.  Works encompassed by 514 are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States maintained copyright relations with the authors country or removed formalities incompatible with Berne.  As a consequence of the barriers to U.S. copyright protection prior to 514s enactment, foreign works restored to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country.  To cushion the impact of their placement in protected status, 514 provides ameliorating accommodations for parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was enacted.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to works 514 removed from the public domain.  They maintain that Congress, in passing 514, exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed 
 
First Amendment limitations.  The District Court granted the Attorney Generals motion for summary judgment.  Affirming in part, the Tenth Circuit agreed that Congress had not offended the Copyright Clause, but concluded that 514 required further 
 
First Amendment inspection in light of Eldred v. Ashcroft, 

537 U.S. 186
.  On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the 
 
First Amendment claim, holding that 514s constriction of the public domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, ruling that 514 was narrowly tailored to fit the important government aim of protecting U.S. copyright holders interests abroad.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Section 514 does not exceed Congress authority under the Copyright Clause.  Pp.1323.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain.  Eldred is largely dispositive of petitioners claim that the Clauses confinement of a copyrights lifespan to a limited Tim[e] prevents the removal of works from the public domain.  In Eldred, the Court upheld the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copyrights.  The text of the Copyright Clause, the Court observed, contains no command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever fixed or inalterable, and the Court declined to infer any such command.  537 U.S., at 199.  The construction petitioners tender here is similarly infirm.  The terms afforded works restored by 514 are no less limited than those the CTEA lengthened.  Nor had the limited Tim[e] already passed for the works at issue heremany of them works formerly denied any U.S. copyright protectionfor a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end.  Petitioners also urge that the Governments position would allow Congress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive limited terms as prior terms expire.  But as in Eldred, such hypothetical misbehavior is far afield from this case.  In aligning the United States with other nations bound by Berne, Congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual copyright regime.  Pp.1315.
			

				
				
				(b)Historical practice corroborates the Courts reading of the Copyright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected works.  In the Copyright Act of 1790, the First Congress protected works that had been freely reproducible under State copyright laws.  Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works.  Several private bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inventions previously in the public domain.  Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works and inventions that had lost protection.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				(c)Petitioners also argue that 514 fails to promote the Progress of Science as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright Clause.  Specifically, they claim that because 514 affects only works already created, it cannot meet the Clauses objective.  The creation of new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote Science, i.e., knowledge and learning.  In Eldred, this Court rejected a nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to induce new works.  Rather the Clause empowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that bodys judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.  537 U.S., at 222.  Nothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, confines the Progress of Science exclusively to incentives for creation.  Historical evidence, congressional practice, and this Courts decisions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing works is an appropriate means to promote science.  Pp.2022.
			

				
				
				(d)Considered against this backdrop, 514 falls comfortably within Congress Copyright Clause authority.  Congress had reason to believe that a well-functioning international copyright system would encourage the dissemination of existing and future works.  And testimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would expand the foreign markets available to U.S. authors and invigorate protection against piracy of U.S. works abroad, thus benefitting copyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.  This Court has no warrant to reject Congress rational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve the objectives of the Copyright Clause.  Pp.2223.
			

				
				
				2.The 
 
First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration authorized by 514.  Pp.2332.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The pathmarking Eldred decision is again instructive.  There, the Court held that the CTEAs enlargement of a copyrights duration did not offend the 
 
First Amendments freedom of expression guarantee.  Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an engine of free expression.  537 U.S., at 219.  The traditional contours of copyright protection, i.e., the idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use defense, moreover, serve as built-in 
 
First Amendment accommodations.  Ibid.  Given the speech-protective purposes and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the heightened review sought in Eldred.  The Court reaches the same conclusion here.  Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression distinction and the fair use defense.  Moreover, Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime.  Pp.2326.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Petitioners claim that 
 
First Amendment interests of a higher order are at stake because theyunlike their Eldred counterpartsenjoyed vested rights in works that had already entered the public domain.  Their contentions depend on an argument already considered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by Congress.  Nothing in the historical record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Courts jurisprudence warrants exceptional 
 
First Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.  Congress has several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of works as well as works previously in the public domain.  Section 514, moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.  The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must pay for their desired use of the authors expression, or else limit their exploitation to fair use of those works.  By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.  Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.  Pp.2630.

Specifically, they claim that because 514 affects only works already created, it cannot meet the Clauses objective.  The creation of new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote Science, i.e., knowledge and learning.  In Eldred, this Court rejected a nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to induce new works.  Rather the Clause empowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that bodys judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.  537 U.S., at 222.  Nothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, confines the Progress of Science exclusively to incentives for creation.  Historical evidence, congressional practice, and this Courts decisions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing works is an appropriate means to promote science.  Pp.2022.
			

				
				
				(d)Considered against this backdrop, 514 falls comfortably within Congress Copyright Clause authority.  Congress had reason to believe that a well-functioning international copyright system would encourage the dissemination of existing and future works.  And testimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would expand the foreign markets available to U.S. authors and invigorate protection against piracy of U.S. works abroad, thus benefitting copyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.  This Court has no warrant to reject Congress rational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve the objectives of the Copyright Clause.  Pp.2223.
			

				
				
				2.The 
 
First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration authorized by 514.  Pp.2332.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The pathmarking Eldred decision is again instructive.  There, the Court held that the CTEAs enlargement of a copyrights duration did not offend the 
 
First Amendments freedom of expression guarantee.  Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an engine of free expression.  537 U.S., at 219.  The traditional contours of copyright protection, i.e., the idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use defense, moreover, serve as built-in 
 
First Amendment accommodations.  Ibid.  Given the speech-protective purposes and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the heightened review sought in Eldred.  The Court reaches the same conclusion here.  Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression distinction and the fair use defense.  Moreover, Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime.  Pp.2326.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Petitioners claim that 
 
First Amendment interests of a higher order are at stake because theyunlike their Eldred counterpartsenjoyed vested rights in works that had already entered the public domain.  Their contentions depend on an argument already considered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by Congress.  Nothing in the historical record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Courts jurisprudence warrants exceptional 
 
First Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.  Congress has several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of works as well as works previously in the public domain.  Section 514, moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.  The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must pay for their desired use of the authors expression, or else limit their exploitation to fair use of those works.  By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.  Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.  Pp.2630.

			Petitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to literary and artistic works section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), 17 U.S.C. 104A, 109(a), removed from the public domain. Petitioners maintained that Congress, in passing section 514, exceeded its authority under the Constitution's Copyright and Patent Clause and violated the First Amendment rights of anyone who previously had access to such works. The Tenth Circuit ruled that section 514 was narrowly tailored to fit the important government aim of protecting U.S. copyright holders' interests abroad. In accord with the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, the Court concluded that section 514 did not transgress constitutional limitations on Congress' authority. The Court held that neither the text of the Copyright and Patent Clause, historical practice, or the Court's precedent excluded application of copyright protection to works in the public domain. The Court also held that nothing in the historical record, subsequent congressional practice, or the Court's jurisprudence warranted exceptional First Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.

				MAPLES v. THOMAS, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 1063.Argued October 4, 2011
				
				Decided January 18, 2012
			

				Petitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in Alabama state court.  In 2001, Maples sought postconviction relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32.  Maples alleged, among other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys, Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the New York offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm.  As required by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer, John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice.  Butler made clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2002, while Maples state postconviction petition was pending, Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell.  Their new employment disabled them from representing Maples.  They did not inform Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel.  In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial courts leave to withdraw.  No other Sullivan & Cromwell attorney entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of a change in Maples representation.  Thus, Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples listed, and only, attorneys of record.
			

				
				
				
				
				The trial court denied Maples petition in May 2003.  Notices of the order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan & Cromwells address.  When those postings were returned, unopened, the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing.  Butler also received a copy of the order, but did not act on it.  With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples behalf, the 42-day period Maples had to file a notice of appeal ran out.
			

				
				
				
				
				About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent a letter directly to Maples.  The letter informed Maples of the missed deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a federal habeas petition.  Maples immediately contacted his mother, who called Sullivan & Cromwell.  Three Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order, thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period.  The court denied the motion.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.
			

				
				
				
				
				Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief.  Both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples failure timely to appeal the state trial courts order denying his Rule 32 petition for postconviction relief.
			

				
				
				Held:Maples has shown the requisite cause to excuse his procedural default.  Pp.1122.
			

				
				
				(a)As a rule, a federal court may not entertain a state prisoners habeas claims when (1) a state court [has] declined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement, and (2) the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.  Walker v. Martin, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.

				Cause for a procedural default exists where something external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,] ... impeded [his] efforts to comply with the States procedural rule.  Id., at 753.  A prisoners postconviction attorneys negligence does not qualify as cause, ibid., because the attorney is the prisoners agent, and under well-settled agency law, the principal bears the risk of his agents negligent conduct, id., at 753754.  Thus, a petitioner is bound by his attorneys failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot rely on that failure to establish cause.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				A markedly different situation arises, however, when an attorney abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.  In such cases, the principal-agent relationship is severed and the attorneys acts or omissions cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].  Id., at 753.  Nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.
			

				
				
				Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. ___, is instructive.  There, the Court found that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition can be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorneys unprofessional conduct may sometimes be an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling.  Id., at ___, ______.  The Court recognized that an attorneys negligence does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory time limit.  Id., at ___.  Hollands claim that he was abandoned by his attorney, however, if true, would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control, id., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.).  Pp.1115.
			

				
				
				(b)From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial courts denial of that petition, Maples sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler.  Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period.  Pp.1521.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented Maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as a result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the 42-day period.  But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples long before the default occurred.  Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial courts permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey that they remained the attorneys of record.  As such, the attorneys, not Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.
			

				
				
				The State asserts that, after Munankas and Ingen-Houszs departure, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as Maples counsel.  At the time of the default, however, those attorneys had not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their appearances on Maples behalf, and had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen- Housz.  Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples behalf before his time to appeal expired.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Maples only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did not even begin to represent Maples.  Butler told Munanka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive role in the case.  Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples agent in any meaningful sense of that word.  Holland, 560 U.S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.).  Upon receiving a copy of the trial courts order, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action.  Nor did the State treat Butler as Maples actual representative.  Notably, the Alabama Assistant Attorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel.  Pp.1920.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice.  He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for commencing an appeal.  Given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from complying with the States procedural rule.  Pp.2021.
			

				
				
				(c)The cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for States finality and comity interests while ensuring that fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.  Dretke v. Haley, 

541 U.S. 386
.  In the unusual circumstances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Maples procedural default.  Through no fault of his own, he lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal period.  And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to prose status.  Pp.2122.
			

				
				
				(d)The question of prejudice, which neither the District Court nor the Eleventh Circuit reached, remains open for decision on remand.  P.22.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP, etal. v. VALLADOLID etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10507.Argued October 11, 2011
				
				Decided January 11, 2012
			

				Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility.  Employee Juan Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore platform, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore facility.  His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 
33 U.S.C. 901 etseq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS] for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf, 
43 U.S.C. 1333(b).  The Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that 1333(b) did not cover Valladolids fatal injury because his accident occurred on land, not on the OCS.  The Labor Departments Benefits Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Rejecting tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.
			

				Held:The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employers extractive operations on the OCS.  Pp.314.
			

				
				
				(a)The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of 1333(b)s scope.  According to the Third Circuit, because Congress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, 1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have occurred but for operations on the OCS.  Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig, but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have been injured but for his traveling to the rig.  In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish a bright-line geographic boundary, extending 1333(b) coverage only to employees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.  Under its situs-of-injury test, a welder injured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligible for 1333(b) benefits.  In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit held that 1333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can establish a substantial nexus between their injury and extractive operations on the OCS.  The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpretation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both duration and nature.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)Contrary to Pacifics position, the Fifth Circuits situs-of-injury test is not the best interpretation of 1333(b).  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Nothing in the text of 1333(b) suggests that an injury must occur on the OCS.  The provision has only two requirements: The extractive operations must be conducted on the [OCS], and the employees injury must occur as the result of those operations.  If, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of 1333(b) was to geographically limit the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from 1333(b) the words as the result of operations conducted.  Moreover, Congress decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but not in 1333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit 1333(b).  This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herbs Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 

470 U.S. 414
, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 

477 U.S. 207
, neither of which held that 1333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS injuries.  Section 1333(b)s text also gives no indication that Congress intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits from LHWCA coverage.  To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Also unpersuasive is Pacifics alternative argument that 1333(b) imports the LHWCAs strict situs-of-injury requirement, which provides benefits only for injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States, 
33 U.S.C. 903(a).  It is unlikely that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts.  In addition, under Pacifics alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the navigable waters above the shelf.  Thus, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a platform explosion would be excluded from 1333(b) coverage.  That view cannot be squared with 1333(b)s language.  Pp.1112.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Pacifics policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation of 1333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLAs text.  P.12.
			

				
				
				(c)Neither the Solicitor Generals status-based inquiry nor the Third Circuits but for test are compatible with 1333(b).  The Solicitor Generals inquiry has no basis in the OCSLAs text, because 1333(b)s occurring as the result of operations language plainly suggests causation.  And when taken to its logical conclusion, the Third Circuits test, though nominally based on causation, is essentially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are doing at the time of injury.  Because LHWCA coverage was extended only to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS], 1333(b)s focus should be on injuries resulting from those operations.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				(d)The Ninth Circuits substantial-nexus test is more faithful to 1333(b)s text.  This Court understands that test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employers on-OCS extractive operations.  The test may not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has established the required significant causal link.  Whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the circumstances of each case.  It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the substantial-nexus test.  P.14.

				PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP, etal. v. VALLADOLID etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10507.Argued October 11, 2011
				
				Decided January 11, 2012
			

				Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility.  Employee Juan Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore platform, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore facility.  His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 
33 U.S.C. 901 etseq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS] for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf, 
43 U.S.C. 1333(b).  The Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that 1333(b) did not cover Valladolids fatal injury because his accident occurred on land, not on the OCS.  The Labor Departments Benefits Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Rejecting tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.
			

				Held:The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employers extractive operations on the OCS.  Pp.314.
			

				
				
				(a)The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of 1333(b)s scope.  According to the Third Circuit, because Congress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, 1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have occurred but for operations on the OCS.  Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig, but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have been injured but for his traveling to the rig.  In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish a bright-line geographic boundary, extending 1333(b) coverage only to employees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.  Under its situs-of-injury test, a welder injured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligible for 1333(b) benefits.  In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit held that 1333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can establish a substantial nexus between their injury and extractive operations on the OCS.  The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpretation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both duration and nature.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)Contrary to Pacifics position, the Fifth Circuits situs-of-injury test is not the best interpretation of 1333(b).  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Nothing in the text of 1333(b) suggests that an injury must occur on the OCS.  The provision has only two requirements: The extractive operations must be conducted on the [OCS], and the employees injury must occur as the result of those operations.  If, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of 1333(b) was to geographically limit the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from 1333(b) the words as the result of operations conducted.  Moreover, Congress decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but not in 1333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit 1333(b).  This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herbs Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 

470 U.S. 414
, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 

477 U.S. 207
, neither of which held that 1333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS injuries.  Section 1333(b)s text also gives no indication that Congress intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits from LHWCA coverage.  To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Also unpersuasive is Pacifics alternative argument that 1333(b) imports the LHWCAs strict situs-of-injury requirement, which provides benefits only for injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States, 
33 U.S.C. 903(a).  It is unlikely that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts.  In addition, under Pacifics alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the navigable waters above the shelf.  Thus, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a platform explosion would be excluded from 1333(b) coverage.  That view cannot be squared with 1333(b)s language.  Pp.1112.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Pacifics policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation of 1333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLAs text.  P.12.
			

				
				
				(c)Neither the Solicitor Generals status-based inquiry nor the Third Circuits but for test are compatible with 1333(b).  The Solicitor Generals inquiry has no basis in the OCSLAs text, because 1333(b)s occurring as the result of operations language plainly suggests causation.  And when taken to its logical conclusion, the Third Circuits test, though nominally based on causation, is essentially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are doing at the time of injury.  Because LHWCA coverage was extended only to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS], 1333(b)s focus should be on injuries resulting from those operations.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				(d)The Ninth Circuits substantial-nexus test is more faithful to 1333(b)s text.  This Court understands that test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employers on-OCS extractive operations.  The test may not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has established the required significant causal link.

			Respondent, widow of an employee of Pacific Operators Offshore, sought benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), 43 U.S.C. 1333(b), which extended LHWCA coverage to injuries ""occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]"" for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf. The ALJ dismissed her claim, reasoning that section 1333(b) did not cover the employee's fatal injury because his accident occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department's Benefits Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court concluded that the Ninth Circuit's ""substantial-nexus"" test was more faithful to the text of section 1333(b).

				HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH AND SCHOOL v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 10553.Argued October 5, 2011Decided January 11, 2012
			

				Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is a member congregation of the Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod.  The Synod classifies its school teachers into two categories: called and lay.  Called teachers are regarded as having been called to their vocation by God.  To be eligible to be considered called, a teacher must complete certain academic requirements, including a course of theological study.  Once called, a teacher receives the formal title Minister of Religion, Commissioned.  Lay teachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran.  Although lay and called teachers at Hosanna-Tabor generally performed the same duties, lay teachers were hired only when called teachers were unavailable.
			

				
				
				
				
				After respondent Cheryl Perich completed the required training, Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher.  Perich accepted the call and was designated a commissioned minister.  In addition to teaching secular subjects, Perich taught a religion class, led her students in daily prayer and devotional exercises, and took her students to a weekly school-wide chapel service.  Perich led the chapel service herself about twice a year.
			

				
				
				
				
				Perich developed narcolepsy and began the 20042005 school year on disability leave.  In January 2005, she notified the school principal that she would be able to report to work in February.  The principal responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher to fill Perichs position for the remainder of the school year.  The principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.  The congregation subsequently offered to pay a portion of Perichs health insurance premiums in exchange for her resignation as a called teacher.  Perich refused to resign.  In February, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until she received written documentation that she had reported to work.  The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be fired.  Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and intended to assert her legal rights.  In a subsequent letter, the chairman of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting.  As grounds for termination, the letter cited Perichs insubordination and disruptive behavior, as well as the damage she had done to her working relationship with the school by threatening to take legal action.  The congregation voted to rescind Perichs call, and Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination.
			

				
				
				
				
				Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit.  Perich intervened in the litigation.  Invoking what is known as the ministerial exception, Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the 
 
First Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-Tabors favor.  The Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded.  It recognized the existence of a ministerial exception rooted in the 
 
First Amendment, but concluded that Perich did not qualify as a minister under the exception.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the 
 
First Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws.  Pp.615.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The 
 
First Amendment provides, in part, that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church.  By forbidding the establishment of religion and guaranteeing the free exercise thereof, the Religion Clauses ensured that the new Federal Governmentunlike the English Crownwould have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)This Court first considered the issue of government interference with a churchs ability to select its own ministers in the context of disputes over church property.  This Courts decisions in that area confirm that it is impermissible for the government to contradict a churchs determination of who can act as its ministers.  See Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679; Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America, 

344 U.S. 94
; Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, 

426 U.S. 696
.  Pp.1012.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence of a ministerial exception, grounded in the 
 
First Amendment, that precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.  The Court agrees that there is such a ministerial exception.  Requiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision.  Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs.  By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious groups right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.  According the state the power to determine which individuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.
			

				
				
				The EEOC and Perich contend that religious organizations can defend against employment discrimination claims by invoking their 
 
First Amendment right to freedom of association.  They thus see no needand no basisfor a special rule for ministers grounded in the Religion Clauses themselves.  Their position, however, is hard to square with the text of the 
 
First Amendment itself, which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations.  The Court cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organizations freedom to select its own ministers.
			

				
				
				The EEOC and Perich also contend that Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 

494 U.S. 872
, precludes recognition of a ministerial exception.  But Smith involved government regulation of only outward physical acts.  The present case, in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.  Pp.1315.
			

				
				
				2.Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the ministerial exception, the 
 
First Amendment requires dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against her religious employer.  Pp.1521.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a religious congregation.  The Court, however, does not adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister.  Here, it is enough to conclude that the exception covers Perich, given all the circumstances of her employment.  Hosanna-Tabor held her out as a minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members.  That title represented a significant degree of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning.  Perich also held herself out as a minister by, for example, accepting the formal call to religious service.  And her job duties reflected a role in conveying the Churchs message and carrying out its mission: As a source of religious instruction, Perich played an important part in transmitting the Lutheran faith.
			

				
				
				In concluding that Perich was not a minister under the exception, the Sixth Circuit committed three errors.  First, it failed to see any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister.  Although such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description of the employees position.  Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same religious duties as Perich.  Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functionsparticularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.  Third, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perichs performance of secular duties.  Although the amount of time an employee spends on particular activities is relevant in assessing that employees status, that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the other considerations discussed above.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Because Perich was a minister for purposes of the exception, this suit must be dismissed.  An order reinstating Perich as a called teacher would have plainly violated the Churchs freedom under the Religion Clauses to select its own ministers.  Though Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, she continues to seek frontpay, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees.  An award of such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the 
 
First Amendment than an order overturning the termination.  Such relief would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by the ministerial exception.
			

				
				
				Any suggestion that Hosanna-Tabors asserted religious reason for firing Perich was pretextual misses the point of the ministerial exception.  The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a churchs decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.  The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control who will minister to the faithful is the churchs alone.  Pp.1920.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)Today the Court holds only that the ministerial exception bars an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister, challenging her churchs decision to fire her.  The Court expresses no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits.  Pp.2021.
			

				597 F.3d 769, reversed.
			

				
				
				Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Kagan, J., joined.

			Hosanna-Tabor, a member congregation of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, operated a small school in Michigan offering a ""Christian-centered education"" to students in kindergarten through eighth grade. The Synod classified its school teachers into two categories: ""called"" and ""lay."" ""Called"" teachers, among other things, were regarded as having been called to their vocation by God. To be eligible to be called from a congregation, a teacher must satisfy certain academic requirements. ""Lay"" or ""contract"" teachers, by contrast, were not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran. ""Called"" teacher, Cheryl Perich filed a charge with the EEOC, claiming that her employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened. Invoking what was known as the ""ministerial exception,"" Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the First Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers. The Court held that the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment barred suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws. Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the ministerial exception, the First Amendment required dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against her religious employer.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of new hampshire
			

				No. 108974.Argued November 2, 2011Decided January 11, 2012
			

				Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, the Nashua, New Hampshire Police Department received a call reporting that an African-American male was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of the callers apartment building.  When an officer responding to the call asked eyewitness Nubia Blandon to describe the man, Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the man she saw breaking into the car was standing in the parking lot, next to a police officer.  Petitioner Barion Perrys arrest followed this identification.
			

				
				
				
				
				Before trial, Perry moved to suppress Blandons identification on the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process.  The New Hampshire trial court denied the motion.  To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at trial, the Superior Court said, this Courts decisions instruct a two-step inquiry: The trial court must first decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure; if they did, the court must next consider whether that procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to render it unreliable and thus inadmissible.  Perrys challenge, the court found, failed at step one, for Blandons identification did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure employed by the police.  A jury subsequently convicted Perry of theft by unauthorized taking.
			

				
				
				
				
				On appeal, Perry argued that the trial court erred in requiring an initial showing that police arranged a suggestive identification procedure.  Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry contended, suffice to require court evaluation of the reliability of an eyewitness identification before allowing it to be presented to the jury.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perrys argument and affirmed his conviction.
			

				
				
				Held:The Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement.  Pp.619.
			

				
				
				(a)The Constitution protects a defendant against a conviction based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unworthy of credit.  Only when evidence is so extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,  Dowling v. United States, 

493 U.S. 342
 (internal quotation marks omitted), does the Due Process Clause preclude its admission.
			

				
				
				Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification procedures.  See Stovall v. Denno, 

388 U.S. 293
; Simmons v. United States, 

390 U.S. 377
; Foster v. California, 

394 U.S. 440
; Neil v. Biggers, 

409 U.S. 188
; and Manson v. Brathwaite, 

432 U.S. 98
.  These cases detail the approach appropriately used to determine whether due process requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement.  First, due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.  Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409 U.S., at 198.  Even when the police use such a procedure, however, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence.  Brathwaite, 432 U.S., at 112113; Biggers, 409 U.S., at 198199.  Instead, due process requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police conduct created a substantial likelihood of misidentification.  Id., at 201.  [R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin of that evaluation.  Brathwaite, 432 U.S., at 114.  Where the indicators of [a witness] ability to make an accurate identification are outweighed by the corrupting effect of law enforcement suggestion, the identification should be suppressed.  Id., at 114, 116.  Otherwise, the identification, assuming no other barrier to its admission, should be submitted to the jury.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				(b)Perry argues that it was mere happenstance that all of the cases in the Stovall line involved improper police action.  The rationale underlying this Courts decisions, Perry asserts, calls for a rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances.  This Court disagrees.
			

				
				
				If reliability is the linchpin of admissibility under the Due Process Clause, Brathwaite, 432 U.S., at 114, Perry contends, it should not matter whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that marred the identification.  This argument removes Brathwaites statement from its mooring, attributing to it a meaning that a fair reading of the opinion does not bear.  The due process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.
			

				
				
				Perrys contention also ignores a key premise of Brathwaite: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances is to deter law enforcement use of improper procedures in the first place.  This deterrence rationale is inapposite in cases, like Perrys, where there is no improper police conduct.  Perry also places significant weight on United States v. Wade, 

388 U.S. 218
, describing it as a decision not anchored to improper police conduct.  But the risk of police rigging was the very danger that prompted the Court in Wade to extend a defendants right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.
			

				
				
				Perrys position would also open the door to judicial preview, under the banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications.  There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewitness with poor vision or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, for example, should be regarded as inherently more reliable than Blandons identification here.  Even if this Court could, as Perry contends, distinguish suggestive circumstances from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perrys limitation would still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examinations, for most eyewitness identifications involve some element of suggestion.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(c)In urging a broadly applicable rule, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are uniquely unreliable.  The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen the evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness.  The Courts unwillingness to adopt such a rule rests, in large part, on its recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence.  It also takes account of other safeguards built into the adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.  These protections include the defendants 
 
Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and to confront and cross-examine the eyewitness, eyewitness-specific instructions warning juries to take care in appraising identification evidence, and state and federal rules of evidence permitting  trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact or potential for misleading the jury.  Many of these safeguards were availed of by Perrys defense.  Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, the introduction of Blandons eyewitness testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability, did not render Perrys trial fundamentally unfair.  Pp.1418.

				No. 101104.Argued November 1, 2011Decided January 10, 2012
			

				Respondent Pollard sought damages from employees at a privately run federal prison in California, claiming that they had deprived him of adequate medical care in violation of the 
 
Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the 
 
Eighth Amendment does not imply an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 

403 U.S. 388
, against a privately managed prisons personnel.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.
			

				Held:Because in the circumstance of this case, state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages actionsproviding both significant deterrence and compensationno Bivens remedy can be implied here.  Pp. 312.
			

				
				
				(a)Wilkie v. Robbins, 

551 U.S. 537
, fairly summarizes the basic considerations the Court applies here.  In deciding whether to recognize a Bivens remedy, a court must first ask whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.  Even absent an alternative, a Bivens remedy is a subject of judgment: the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed ... to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.  Id., at 550.  In Bivens itself, the Court held that the 
 
Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents violation of the Amendments strictures, 403 U.S., at 389, noting that the 
 
Fourth Amendment prohibited conduct that state law might permit, id., at 392393, and that the interests protected on the one hand by state trespass and invasion of privacy laws and on the other hand by the 
 
Fourth Amendment may be inconsistent or even hostile, id., at 394.  It also stated that [h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty, id., at 395, and found no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.  Id., at 396.  Bivens actions were allowed in Davis v. Passman, 

442 U.S. 228
, for a 
 
Fifth Amendment due process claim involving gender-based employment discrimination, and in Carlson v. Green, 

446 U.S. 14
, for an 
 
Eighth Amendment claim based on federal government officials deliberat[e] indifferen[ce] to a federal prisoners medical needs, id., at 16, n.1, 17.  Since Carlson, this Court has declined to imply a Bivens action in several different instances.  See, e.g., Bush v. Lucas, 

462 U.S. 367
, Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 

534 U.S. 61
. 
			

				
				
				Applying Wilkies approach here, Pollard cannot assert a Bivens claim, primarily because his 
 
Eighth Amendment claim focuses on a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law.  And in the case of a privately employed defendant, state tort law provides an alternative, existing process capable of protecting the constitutional interests at stake.  Wilkie, 551 U.S., at 550.  The existence of that alternative remedy constitutes a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.  Ibid.  Pp. 37.
			

				
				
				(b)Pollards contrary arguments are rejected.  First, he claims that Carlson authorizes an 
 
Eighth Amendment-based Bivens action here, but Carlson involved government, not privately employed, personnel.  The potential existence of an adequate alternative, existing process differs dramatically for public and private employees, as prisoners ordinarily can bring state tort actions against private employees, but not against public ones.  Second, Pollards argument that this Court should consider only whether federal laws provide adequate alternative remedies because of the vagaries of state tort law, Carlson, supra, at 23, was rejected in Malesko, supra, at 7273.  Third, Pollard claims that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here, but California, like every other State (as far as the Court is aware), has tort law that provides for negligence actions for claims such as his.  That the state law may prove less generous than would a Bivens action does not render the state law inadequate, and state remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent. Fourth, Pollard argues that there may be similar 
 
Eighth Amendment claims that state tort law does not cover, but he offers no supporting cases.  The possibility of a future case, where an 
 
Eighth Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from those at issue, provides insufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.  Pp. 712.

			Respondent sought damages from employees at a privately run federal prison in California, claiming that they had deprived him of adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. At issue was whether the Court could imply the existence of an Eighth Amendment-based damages action against employees of a privately operated federal prison. Because the Court believed that in the circumstances of this case, state tort law authorized adequate alternative damage actions - actions that provide both significant deterrence and compensation - no Bivens v.

				SMITH v. CAIN, WARDEN
			

				certiorari to the criminal district court of louisiana, orleans parish
			

				No. 108145.Argued November 8, 2011Decided January 10, 2012
			

				Petitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on the testimony of a single eyewitness.  During state postconviction relief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by the eyewitness contradicting his testimony.  Smith argued that the prosecutions failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v. Maryland, 

373 U.S. 83
.  Brady held that due process bars a State from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendants guilt or punishment.  See id., at 87.  The state trial court rejected Smiths Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.
			

				Held:Brady requires that Smiths conviction be reversed. The State does not dispute that the eyewitnesss statements were favorable to Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith.  Under Brady, evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Cone v. Bell, 

556 U.S. 449
470.  A reasonable probability means that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to undermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.  Kyles v. Whitley, 

514 U.S. 419

				SMITH v. CAIN, WARDEN
			

				certiorari to the criminal district court of louisiana, orleans parish
			

				No. 108145.Argued November 8, 2011Decided January 10, 2012
			

				Petitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on the testimony of a single eyewitness.  During state postconviction relief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by the eyewitness contradicting his testimony.  Smith argued that the prosecutions failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v. Maryland, 

373 U.S. 83
.  Brady held that due process bars a State from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendants guilt or punishment.  See id., at 87.  The state trial court rejected Smiths Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.
			

				Held:Brady requires that Smiths conviction be reversed. The State does not dispute that the eyewitnesss statements were favorable to Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith.  Under Brady, evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Cone v. Bell, 

556 U.S. 449

				GONZALEZ v. THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 10895.Argued November 2, 2011Decided January 10, 2012
			

				After the intermediate state appellate court affirmed his state-court conviction, petitioner Gonzalez allowed his time for seeking discretionary review with the States highest court for criminal appeals to expire.  Roughly six weeks later, the intermediate state appellate court issued its mandate.  When Gonzalez subsequently sought federal habeas relief, the District Court dismissed Gonzalezs petition as time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  Under 
28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), state prisoners have one year to file federal habeas petitions running from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  The District Court held that Gonzalezs judgment had become final when his time for seeking discretionary review in the States highest court expired, and that running the limitations period from that date, his petition was untimely.
			

				
				
				
				
				Under AEDPA, a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal a district courts final order in a habeas proceeding.  
28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(1).  The COA may issue only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, 2253(c)(2), and shall indicate which specific issue satisfies that showing, 2253(c)(3).  A Fifth Circuit judge granted Gonzalez a COA on the question whether his petition was timely.  The issued COA, however, failed to indicate a constitutional issue.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Gonzalezs petition was untimely because the limitations period begins to run for petitioners who fail to appeal to a States highest court when the time for seeking further direct review in the state court expires.  The Fifth Circuit did not mention, and the State did not raise, the 2253(c)(3) defect.  When Gonzalez petitioned this Court for review, the State argued for the first time that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalezs appeal based on the 2253(c)(3) defect.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule.  A COAs failure to indicate a constitutional issue does not deprive a Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal.  Pp. 413.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)A rule is jurisdictional [i]f the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statutes scope shall count as jurisdictional, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 

546 U.S. 500
.  Here, the only clear jurisdictional language in 2253(c) appears in 2253(c)(1).  The parties agree that 2253(c)(1)s plain terms make the issuance of a COA a jurisdictional prerequisite.  The parties also agree that 2253(c)(2), which speaks only to when a COA may issue and does not contain 2253(c)(1)s jurisdictional terms, is nonjurisdictional.  It follows that 2253(c)(3) is also nonjurisdictional.  Like 2253(c)(2), it reflects a threshold condition for issuing a COA, and does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer ... to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.  Arbaugh, 546 U.S., at 515.  Jurisdictional treatment also would thwart Congresss intent in AEDPA to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process. Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. ___, ___.  Once a judge has determined that a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in briefing and argument, the COA has fulfilled its gatekeeping function.  Pp. 49.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The States contrary arguments are unpersuasive.   Section 2253(c)(3)s cross-reference to 2253(c)(1) does not mean 2253(c)(3) can be read as part of 2253(c)(1), as Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs with distinct terms.  The word shall in 2253(c)(3), meanwhile, underscores the rules mandatory nature, but not all mandatory rules are jurisdictional.  Nor does 2253(c)(3)s mere proximity to other jurisdictional provisions turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle.  Finally, the Court rejects the States attempt to analogize a COA to a notice of appeal.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				2.For a state prisoner who does not seek review in a States highest court, the judgment becomes final for purposes of 2244(d)(1)(A) on the date that the time for seeking such review expires.  Pp. 1319.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)In Clay v. United States, 

537 U.S. 522
, the Court held that a federal conviction becomes final when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.  Id., at 527.  In Jimenez v. Quarterman, 

555 U.S. 113
, the Court adopted Clays most natural reading of the statutory text in construing the similar language of 2244(d)(1)(A).  Id., at 119.  The Court made no mention of when Jimenezs appeal concluded and held that his judgment became final when his time for seeking certiorari expired.  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) thus consists of two prongs corresponding to two categories of petitioners.  For petitioners pursuing direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment becomes final at the conclusion of direct review, when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies certiorari.  For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the expiration of the time for seeking such review, when the time for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.  Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the States highest court, his judgment became final when his time for seeking review with that court expired.  Pp.1315.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Gonzalez argues that courts should determine both prongs for every petitioner who does not seek certiorari, then start the 1-year clock from the latest of the two dates.  Gonzalez further contends that when a petitioner does not seek certiorari, state law should define the conclusion of direct review.  The words latest of, however, appear in 2244(d)(1), not 2244(d)(1)(A).  Nothing in 2244(d)(1)(A) contemplates any conflict between the two prongs or instructs that the later of the two shall prevail.  Gonzalezs approach of scouring each States laws and cases to determine how the State defines finality, moreover, would contradict the uniform meaning of conclusion of direct review that Clay and Jimenez accepted.  It will be a rare situation in which a delay in the mandates issuance is so severe as to prevent a petitioner from filing a federal habeas petition within a year or requesting a stay and abeyance.  Finally, the Court rejects Gonzalezs alternative argument that his petition is timely because it was filed within a year of when his time for seeking certiorari review expired.  Pp. 1519.
			

				623 F.3d 222, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

			This case interpreted two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (AEDPA). The first, 28 U.S.C. 2253(c), provided that a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal a federal district court's final order in a habeas proceeding (section 2253(c)(1)). The COA could issue only if the petitioner had made a ""substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right"" (section 2253(c)(2)), and ""shall indicate which specific issue"" satisfied that showing (section 2253(c)(3)). The Court held that section 2253(c)(3) was not a jurisdictional requirement. Accordingly, a judge's failure to ""indicate"" the requisite constitutional issue in a COA did not deprive a court of appeals of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the habeas petitioner's appeal. The second provision, 28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), established a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file federal habeas petitions, running from ""the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review."" The Court held that, for a state prisoner who did not seek review in a State's highest court, the judgment became ""final"" on the date that the time for seeking such review expired.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10948.Argued October 11, 2011Decided January 10, 2012
			

				Although respondents credit card agreement required their claims to be resolved by binding arbitration, they filed a lawsuit against petitioner CompuCredit Corporation and a division of petitioner bank, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA).  The Federal District Court denied the defendants motion to compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims to be nonarbitrable.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its terms.  Pp.210.
			

				
				
				(a)Section 2 of the FAA establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 

460 U.S. 1
.  It requires that courts enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.  See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 

470 U.S. 213

482 U.S. 220
.  Pp.23.
			

				
				
				(b)The CROA provides no such command.  Respondents contend that the CROAs disclosure provisionwhich requires credit repair organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes the sentence You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the [Act], 
15 U.S.C. 1679c(a)gives consumers the right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA prohibits the waiver of any right of the consumer under this subchapter, 1679f(a), the arbitration agreements waiver of the right to bring a court action cannot be enforced.  Respondents premise is flawed.  The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a credit repair organizations liab[ility] for fail[ure] to comply with [the Act].  1679g(a).  That provision does not override the FAAs mandate.  Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a right to initial judicial enforcement.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(c)At the time of the CROAs enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts generally, or in financial services contracts in particular.  Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.  Pp.89.
