				HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO. etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 12729.Argued October 15, 2013Decided December 16, 2013
			

				Respondent Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) is the administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.s (Wal-Mart) Group Long Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The Plans insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant to the judicial review provision in ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), 

29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after proof of loss is due.  Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford.  After petitioner exhausted the mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial.  Almost three years after that final denial but more than three years after proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pursuant to ERISA 502(a)(1)(B).  Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was untimely.  The District Court granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent.  The Second Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:The Plans limitations provision is enforceable.  Pp.416.
			

				
				
				(a)The courts of appeals require participants in an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA to exhaust the plans administrative remedies before filing suit to recover benefits.  A plan participants cause of action under ERISA 502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until the plan issues a final denial.  But it does not follow that a plan and its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period before that time.  Pp.48.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The rule set forth in Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Wolfe, 

331 U.S. 586
, provides that a contractual limitations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary.  That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability of the Plans limitations provision.  The Wolfe approach necessarily allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and to its commencement.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The principle that contractual limitations provisions should ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the context of an ERISA plan.  Heimeshoffs cause of action is bound up with the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to bring suit to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.  1132(a)(1)(B).  This Court has thus recognized the particular importance of enforcing plan terms as written in 502(a)(1)(B) claims,  see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U.S. ___, ___, and will not presume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different approach here.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				(b)Unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or there is a controlling statute to the contrary, Wolfe, supra, at 608, the Plans limitations provision must be given effect.  Pp.816.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The Plans period is not unreasonably short.  Applicable regulations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about one year.  Here, the Plans administrative review process (internal review) required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with approximately one year to file suit.  Her reliance on Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 

432 U.S. 355
, in which this Court declined to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII employment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavailing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to bringing a timely ERISA 502(a)(1)(B) claim.  Pp.910.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)This Court rejects the contentions of Heimeshoff and the United States that the limitations provision is unenforceable because it will undermine ERISAs two-tiered remedial scheme.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(i)Enforcement of the Plans limitation provision is unlikely to cause participants to shortchange the internal review process.  The record for judicial review generally has been limited to the administrative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during internal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.  In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such determinations only for abuse of discretion.  Pp.1112.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(ii)It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will endanger judicial review.  To the extent that administrators attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant.  Evidence from forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual provision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review will not diminish the availability of judicial review either.  Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA 502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3-year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights.  More- over, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as waiver or estoppel, see, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., 

136 U.S. 287
299, and equitable tolling, see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 

498 U.S. 89
, that nevertheless may allow participants to proceed.  Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolution beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time.  29 CFR 2560.5031(c)(3)(ii).  Pp.1215.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Heimeshoffs additional arguments are unpersuasive.  The limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during internal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the limitations provision, which is enforceable.  And federal courts need not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not borrowed from state law.  Pp.1516.
			

				496 Fed. Appx. 129, affirmed.

			Hartford is the administrator of Wal-Marts Group Disability Plan, which is covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant to ERISA, 29 U. S. C. 1132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after proof of loss is due. Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits. Following mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued a final denial. Almost three years after the final denial but more than three years after proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff sought judicial review under ERISA. The district court dismissed, reasoning that while ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations, the contractual limitations period was enforceable under state law and Circuit precedent. The Second Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court affirmed, finding the limitations provision enforceable. A participants ERISA cause of action does not accrue until the plan issues a final denial, but it does not follow that a plan and its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period before that time. The Court noted that contractual limitations provisions should ordinarily be enforced as written. The period at issue is not unreasonably short and does not undermine ERISAs two-tiered remedial scheme by causing participants to shortchange the internal review process.  If administrators attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith, the penalty for failure to meet regulatory deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant and courts can apply waiver or estoppel. Plans offering appeals beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time, 29 CFR 2560.5031(c)(3)(ii).

				KANSAS v. CHEEVER
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
			

				No. 12609.Argued October 16, 2013Decided December 11, 2013
			

				Shortly after respondent Cheever was charged with capital murder, the Kansas Supreme Court found the States death penalty scheme unconstitutional.  State prosecutors then dismissed their charges to allow federal authorities to prosecute him.  When Cheever filed notice that he intended to introduce expert evidence that methamphetamine intoxication negated his ability to form specific intent, the Federal District Court ordered Cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.  The federal case was eventually dismissed without prejudice.  Meanwhile, this Court held the States death penalty scheme constitutional, see Kansas v. Marsh, 

548 U.S. 163
.  The State then brought a second prosecution.  At trial, Cheever raised a voluntary intoxication defense, offering expert testimony regarding his methamphetamine use.  In rebuttal, the State sought to present testimony from the expert who had examined Cheever by the Federal District Court order.  Defense counsel objected, arguing that since Cheever had not agreed to the examination, introduction of the testimony would violate the 
 
Fifth Amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself.  The trial court allowed the testimony, and the jury found Cheever guilty and voted to impose a death sentence.  The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the conviction and sentence, relying on Estelle v. Smith, 

451 U.S. 454
, in which this Court held that a court-ordered psychiatric examination violated a defendants 
 
Fifth Amendment rights when the defendant neither initiated the examination nor put his mental capacity in dispute.  The court distinguished the holding of Buchanan v. Kentucky, 

483 U.S. 402
, that a State may introduce the results of such an examination for the limited purpose of rebutting a mental-status defense, on the basis that voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect under Kansas law.
			

				Held:The rule of Buchanan, reaffirmed here, applies in this case to permit the prosecution to offer the rebuttal evidence at issue.  Pp.410.
			

				
				
				(a)In Buchanan, the prosecution presented evidence from a court-ordered evaluation to rebut the defendants affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.  This Court concluded that this rebuttal testimony did not offend the 
 
Fifth Amendment, holding that when a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense, the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.  Buchanans reasoning was not limited to the circumstance that the evaluation was requested jointly by the defense and the government.  Nor did the case turn on whether state law referred to extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)The admission of rebuttal testimony under the rule of Buchanan harmonizes with the principle that when a defendant chooses to testify in a criminal case, the 
 
Fifth Amendment does not allow him to refuse to answer related questions on cross-examination.  See Fitzpatrick v. United States, 

178 U.S. 304
.  Here, the prosecution elicited testimony from its expert only after Cheever offered expert testimony about his inability to form the requisite mens rea.  Excluding this testimony would have undermined Buchanan and the core truth-seeking function of trial.  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				(c)This Court is not persuaded by the Kansas Supreme Courts reasoning that Cheever did not waive his 
 
Fifth Amendment privilege because voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect as a matter of state law.  Mental disease or defect is not the salient phrase under this Courts precedents, which use the much broader phrase mental status, Buchanan, 483 U.S., at 423.  Mental-status defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendants mens rea, mental capacity to commit the crime, or ability to premeditate.  To the extent that the Kansas Supreme Court declined to apply Buchanan because Cheevers intoxication was temporary, this Courts precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed, as evidenced by the fact that the courts where Buchanan was tried treated his extreme emotional disturbance as a temporary condition.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				(d)This Court declines to address in the first instance Cheevers contention that the prosecutions use of the court-ordered psychiatric examination exceeded the rebuttal-purpose limit established by Buchanan, see 483 U.S., at 424.  Pp.910.
			

				295 Kan. 229, 284 P.3d 1007, vacated and remanded.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

				SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
			

				No. 12815.Argued November 5, 2013Decided December 10, 2013
			

				Sprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), a national telecommunications service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.  Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls, which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint.  Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint.  Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.  Rejecting Sprints argument that this question was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUBs decision.  As relief, Sprint sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUBs order.  Sprint also sought review of the IUBs order in Iowa state court, reiterating the preemption argument made in Sprints federal-court complaint and asserting several other claims.  Invoking Younger v. Harris, 

401 U.S. 37
, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating Sprints complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Courts abstention decision, concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongoing state-court review concerned Iowas important interest in regulating and enforcing state utility rates.  
			

				Held:This case does not fall within any of the three classes of exceptional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				(a)The District Court had jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempted the IUBs decision, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 

535 U.S. 635
, and thus had a virtually unflagging obligation to hear and decide the case, Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 

424 U.S. 800
.  In Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.  This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 

420 U.S. 592
, or that implicate a States interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 

481 U.S. 1
, but has reaffirmed that only exceptional circumstances justify a federal courts refusal to decide a case in deference to the States, New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 

491 U.S. 350
 (NOPSI).  NOPSI identified three such exceptional circumstances.  First, Younger precludes federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.  See 491 U.S., at 368.  Second, certain civil enforcement proceedings warrant Younger abstention.  Ibid.  Finally, federal courts should refrain from interfering with pending civil proceedings involving certain orders ... uniquely in furtherance of the state courts ability to perform their judicial functions.  Ibid.  This Court has not applied Younger outside these three exceptional categories, and rules, in accord with NOPSI, that they define Youngers scope.  Pp.68. 
			

				
				
				(b)The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSIs three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger abstention.  The first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the IUBs proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character, and which did not touch on a state courts ability to perform its judicial function.  Nor is the IUBs order an act of civil enforcement of the kind to which Younger has been extended.  The IUB proceeding is not akin to a criminal prosecution.  Huffman, 420 U.S., at 604.  Nor was it initiated by the State in its sovereign capacity, Trainor v. Hernandez, 

431 U.S. 434
, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn.,

				SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
			

				No. 12815.Argued November 5, 2013Decided December 10, 2013
			

				Sprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), a national telecommunications service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.  Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls, which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint.  Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint.  Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.  Rejecting Sprints argument that this question was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUBs decision.  As relief, Sprint sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUBs order.  Sprint also sought review of the IUBs order in Iowa state court, reiterating the preemption argument made in Sprints federal-court complaint and asserting several other claims.  Invoking Younger v. Harris, 

401 U.S. 37
, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating Sprints complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Courts abstention decision, concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongoing state-court review concerned Iowas important interest in regulating and enforcing state utility rates.  
			

				Held:This case does not fall within any of the three classes of exceptional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				(a)The District Court had jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempted the IUBs decision, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 

535 U.S. 635
, and thus had a virtually unflagging obligation to hear and decide the case, Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 

424 U.S. 800
.  In Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.  This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 

420 U.S. 592
, or that implicate a States interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 

481 U.S. 1
, but has reaffirmed that only exceptional circumstances justify a federal courts refusal to decide a case in deference to the States, New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 

491 U.S. 350
 (NOPSI).  NOPSI identified three such exceptional circumstances.  First, Younger precludes federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.  See 491 U.S., at 368.  Second, certain civil enforcement proceedings warrant Younger abstention.  Ibid.  Finally, federal courts should refrain from interfering with pending civil proceedings involving certain orders ... uniquely in furtherance of the state courts ability to perform their judicial functions.  Ibid.  This Court has not applied Younger outside these three exceptional categories, and rules, in accord with NOPSI, that they define Youngers scope.  Pp.68. 
			

				
				
				(b)The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSIs three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger abstention.  The first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the IUBs proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character, and which did not touch on a state courts ability to perform its judicial function.  Nor is the IUBs order an act of civil enforcement of the kind to which Younger has been extended.  The IUB proceeding is not akin to a criminal prosecution.  Huffman, 420 U.S., at 604.  Nor was it initiated by the State in its sovereign capacity, Trainor v. Hernandez, 

431 U.S. 434
, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn., 

457 U.S. 423
434.  Rather, the action was initiated by Sprint, a private corporation.  No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprints activities or lodged a formal complaint against Sprint.  
			

				
				
				Once Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administrative proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essentially, a civil enforcement action.  However, the IUBs adjudicative authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.  
			

				
				
				In holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Circuit misinterpreted this Courts decision in Middlesex to mean that Younger abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) an ongoing state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) ... provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal] challenges.

The three Middlesex conditions invoked by the Court of Appeals were therefore not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Younger.  Younger extends to the three exceptional circumstances identified in NOPSI, but no further.  Pp.811.

			Sprint, a national telecommunications company, declined to pay intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream, an Iowa telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA) preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic. Windstream threatened to block Sprint customer calls; Sprint sought an injunction from the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB). Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint sought to withdraw its complaint.

				UNITED STATES v. WOODS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 12562.Argued October 9, 2013Decided December 3, 2013
			

				Respondent Gary Woods and his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, participated in an offsetting-option tax shelter designed to generate large paper losses that they could use to reduce their taxable income.  To that end, they purchased from Deutsche Bank a series of currency-option spreads.  Each spread was a package consisting of a long option, which Woods and McCombs purchased from Deutsche Bank and for which they paid a premium, and a short option, which Woods and McCombs sold to Deutsche Bank and for which they received a premium.  Because the premium paid for the long option was largely offset by the premium received for the short option, the net cost of the package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost of the long option alone.  Woods and McCombs contributed the spreads, along with cash, to two partnerships, which used the cash to purchase stock and currency.  When calculating their basis in the partnership interests, Woods and McCombs considered only the long component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short component.  As a result, when the partnerships assets were disposed of for modest gains, Woods and McCombs claimed huge losses.  Al-though they had contributed roughly $3.2 million in cash and spreads to the partnerships, they claimed losses of more than $45 million.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Internal Revenue Service sent each partnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, disregarding the partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses.  It concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax avoidance and thus lacked economic substance, i.e., they were shams.  As there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their partnership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax underpayments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements.  Woods sought judicial review.  The District Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the partnerships lack of economic substance could justify imposing a valuation-misstatement penalty on the partners.  Pp.611.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Because a partnership does not pay federal income taxes, its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.  Under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the IRS initiates partnership-related tax proceedings at the partnership level to adjust partnership items, i.e., items relevant to the partnership as a whole.  26 U.S.C. 6221, 6231(a)(3).  Once the adjustments become final, the IRS may undertake further proceedings at the partner level to make any resulting computational adjustments in the tax liability of the individual partners.  6230(a)(1)(2), (c), 6231(a)(6).  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Under TEFRAs framework, a court in a partnership-level proceeding has jurisdiction to determine the applicability of any penalty ... which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.  6226(f).  A determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is such an adjustment.  TEFRA authorizes courts in partnership-level proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership item, even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent, partner-level proceeding.  In that later proceeding, each partner may raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specifically.  Applying those principles here, the District Court had jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement penalty.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				2.The valuation-misstatement penalty applies in this case.  Pp.1116.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)A penalty applies to the portion of any underpayment that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement, which exists where the value of any property (or the adjusted basis of any property) claimed on any return of tax exceeds by a specified percentage the amount determined to be the correct amount of such valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).  6662(a), (b)(3), (e)(1)(A), (h).  The penaltys plain language makes it applicable here.  Once the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes, no partner could legitimately claim a basis in his partnership interest greater than zero.  Any underpayment resulting from use of a non-zero basis would therefore be attributable to the partners having claimed an adjusted basis in the partnerships that exceeded the correct amount of such ... adjusted basis.  6662(e)(1)(A).  And under the relevant Treasury Regulation, when an assets adjusted basis is zero, a valuation misstatement is automatically deemed gross.  Pp.1112.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Woods contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  The valuation-misstatement penalty encompasses misstatements that rest on legal as well as factual errors, so it is applicable to misstatements that rest on the use of a sham partnership.  And the partnerships lack of economic substance is not an independent ground separate from the misstatement of basis in this case.  Pp.1216.

				ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTRUCTION CO., INC. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 12929.Argued October 9, 2013Decided December 3, 2013
			

				Petitioner Atlantic Marine Construction Co., a Virginia corporation, entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on a construction project.  The subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia.  When a dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of Texas.  Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue wrong under 

28 U.S.C. 1406(a) and improper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).  In the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under 

28 U.S.C. 1404(a).  The District Court denied both motions.  It concluded that 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under 1404(a); and that the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors, only one of which was the forum-selection clause.  After weighing those factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marines petition for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under 1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under 1404(a).  The court agreed with the District Court that 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by 1404(a).  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.A forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under 1404(a), which provides that [f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is wrong or improper.  Whether venue is wrong or improper depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws.  Title 

28 U.S.C. 1391, which governs venue generally, states that [e]xcept as otherwise provided by law... this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in federal district courts.  1391(a)(1).  It then defines districts in which venue is proper.  See 1391(b).  If a case falls within one of 1391(b)s districts, venue is proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under 1406(a).  Whether the parties contract contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the specified districts.
			

				
				
				This conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue provisions, which reflects Congress intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal ju- risdiction over the defendant.  See 1391(b)(3).  The conclusion also follows from this Courts decisions construing the federal venue statutes.  See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 

376 U.S. 612
; Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 

487 U.S. 22
.  Pp.48.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court wrong or improper under 1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under 1404(a), which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.  Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the federal court system.  When a forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another federal court.  Sinochem Intl Co. v. Malaysia Intl Shipping Corp., 

549 U.S. 422
.  For all other cases, parties may still invoke the residual forum non conveniens doctrine.  See id., at 430.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)The Court declines to consider whether a defendant in a breach-of-contract action could obtain dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) if the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a forum-selection clause.  Petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss un- der Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rules application.  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				2.When a defendant files a 1404(a) motion, a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.  No such exceptional factors appear to be present in this case.  Pp.1117.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Normally, a district court considering a 1404(a) motion must evaluate both the private interests of the parties and public-interest considerations.  But when the parties contract contains a valid forum-selection clause, that clause represents [their] agreement as to the most proper forum, Stewart, 487 U.S., at 31, and should be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases, id., at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The presence of a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to adjust their usual 1404(a) analysis in three ways.  First, the plaintiffs choice of forum merits no weight, and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted.  Second, the court should not consider the parties private interests aside from those embodied in the forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests.  Because public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases.

				ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTRUCTION CO., INC. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 12929.Argued October 9, 2013Decided December 3, 2013
			

				Petitioner Atlantic Marine Construction Co., a Virginia corporation, entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on a construction project.  The subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia.  When a dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of Texas.  Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue wrong under 

28 U.S.C. 1406(a) and improper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).  In the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under 

28 U.S.C. 1404(a).  The District Court denied both motions.  It concluded that 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under 1404(a); and that the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors, only one of which was the forum-selection clause.  After weighing those factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marines petition for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under 1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under 1404(a).  The court agreed with the District Court that 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by 1404(a).  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.A forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under 1404(a), which provides that [f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is wrong or improper.  Whether venue is wrong or improper depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws.  Title 

28 U.S.C. 1391, which governs venue generally, states that [e]xcept as otherwise provided by law... this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in federal district courts.  1391(a)(1).  It then defines districts in which venue is proper.  See 1391(b).  If a case falls within one of 1391(b)s districts, venue is proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under 1406(a).  Whether the parties contract contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the specified districts.
			

				
				
				This conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue provisions, which reflects Congress intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal ju- risdiction over the defendant.  See 1391(b)(3).  The conclusion also follows from this Courts decisions construing the federal venue statutes.  See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 

376 U.S. 612
; Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 

487 U.S. 22
.  Pp.48.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court wrong or improper under 1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under 1404(a), which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.  Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the federal court system.  When a forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another federal court.  Sinochem Intl Co. v. Malaysia Intl Shipping Corp., 

549 U.S. 422
.  For all other cases, parties may still invoke the residual forum non conveniens doctrine.  See id., at 430.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)The Court declines to consider whether a defendant in a breach-of-contract action could obtain dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) if the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a forum-selection clause.  Petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss un- der Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rules application.  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				2.When a defendant files a 1404(a) motion, a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.  No such exceptional factors appear to be present in this case.  Pp.1117.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Normally, a district court considering a 1404(a) motion must evaluate both the private interests of the parties and public-interest considerations.  But when the parties contract contains a valid forum-selection clause, that clause represents [their] agreement as to the most proper forum, Stewart, 487 U.S., at 31, and should be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases, id., at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The presence of a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to adjust their usual 1404(a) analysis in three ways.  First, the plaintiffs choice of forum merits no weight, and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted.  Second, the court should not consider the parties private interests aside from those embodied in the forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests.  Because public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases.  Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a 1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venues choice-of-law rules.  See Van Dusen, supra, at 639.  Pp.1216.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Here, the District Courts application of 1404(a) did not comport with these principles.  The court improperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties contractually preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer.  It also erred in giving weight to the parties private interests outside those expressed in the forum-selection clause.  And its holding that public interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Virginia rested in part on the District Courts mistaken belief that the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas choice-of-law rules instead of Virginias.  Pp.1617.
			

				701 F.3d 736, reversed and remanded.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				FORD MOTOR COMPANY v. UNITED STATES
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 13113.Decided December 2, 2013
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				When a taxpayer overpays his taxes, he is generally entitled to interest from the Government for the period between the payment and the ultimate refund.  See 

26 U.S.C. 6611(a).  That interest begins to run from the date of overpayment.  6611(b)(1), (b)(2).  But the Code does not define the date of overpayment.
			

				
				
				In this case, after the Internal Revenue Service advised Ford Motor Company that it had underpaid its taxes from 1983 until 1989, Ford remitted a series of deposits to the IRS totaling $875 million.  Those deposits stopped the ac-crual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the audits were completed and the amount of its underpayment was finally determined.  See 6601; Rev. Proc. 8458, 19842 Cum. Bull. 501.  Later, Ford requested that the IRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the additional tax that Ford owed.  Eventually the parties determined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant years, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the over-payment as well as interest.  But the parties disagreed about when the interest began to run under 

26 U.S.C. 6611(b)(1).  Ford argued that the date of overpayment was the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.  Ibid.  The Government countered that the date of overpayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS treat the remittances as payments of tax.  The difference between the parties competing interpretations of 6611(b) is worth some $445 million.
			

				
				
				Ford sued the Government in Federal District Court, asserting jurisdiction under 

28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1).  The Government did not contest the courts jurisdiction.  See Brief in Opposition 3, n.3.  The District Court accepted the Governments construction of 6611(b) and granted its motion for judgment on the pleadings.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that 6611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be construed strictly in favor of the Government.  508 Fed. Appx. 506 (2012).
			

				
				
				Ford sought certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit was wrong to give 6611 a strict construction.  In Fords view, it is 

28 U.S.C. 1346not 6611that waives the Governments immunity from this suit, and 6611(b) is a substantive provision that should not be construed strictly.  See Gmez-Prez v. Potter, 

553 U.S. 474, 
491 (2008)
; United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 

537 U.S. 465
473 (2003).  In its response to Fords petition for certiorari, however, the Government contended for the first time that 1346(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit; it argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and the only general waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses [Fords] claim, is the Tucker Act, 

28 U.S.C. 1491(a).  Brief in Opposition 3, n.3.  Although the Government acquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Government is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this suit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the United States Court of Federal Claims.  See 1491(a).
			

				
				
				This Court is one of final review, not of first view.  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 

556 U.S. 502, 
529 (2009)
 (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 

544 U.S. 709, 
718, n. 
7 (2005)
).  The Sixth Circuit should have the first opportunity to consider the Governments new contention with respect to jurisdiction in this case.  Depending on that courts answer, it may also consider what impact, if any, the jurisdictional determination has on the merits issues, especially whether or not 6611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that should be construed strictly.
			

				
				
				The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
			

				It is so ordered.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 12414.Argued October 8, 2013Decided November 5, 2013
			

				Respondent Titlow and Billie Rogers were arrested for the murder of Billies husband.  After explaining to respondent that the States evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondents attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agreement to testify against Billie.  Three days before Billies trial, respondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the original plea.  Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted.  Respondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder.  On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assistance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn the strength of the States evidence.  The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim, concluding that Tocas actions were reasonable in light of his clients protestations of innocence.  On federal habeas review, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals ruling was reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  It found the factual predicate for the state courts decisionthat the plea withdrawal was based on respondents assertion of innocencean unreasonable interpretation of the factual record, given Tocas explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision to withdraw was made because the States original plea offer was higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guidelines.  It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.
			

				Held:The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the doubly deferential standard of review recognized by the Courts case law when it refused to credit the state courts reasonable factual finding and assumed that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				(a)AEDPA recognizes the federalism principle that state courts are adequate forums for the vindication of federal statutory and constitutional rights.  It erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court, requiring them to show that the state courts ruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error ... beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Appeals factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea only after respondents proclamation of innocence.  The facts that respondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when Billies husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and hired Toca just three days before Billies trial at which respondent had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to Toca.  The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its contrary conclusion was that Tocas sole explanation at the withdrawal hearing focused on the fact that the States plea offer was substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.  The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Tocas representations to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about a defendants asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal punishment on the other.  Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence to Toca, the Sixth Circuits Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.  More troubling is that courts conclusion that Toca was ineffective because the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea.  The Sixth Circuit turned on its head the principle that counsel should be strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment, Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
, with the burden to show otherwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687.  The single fact that Toca failed to retrieve respondents file from former counsel before withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Stricklands strong presumption of effectiveness.  In any event, respondent admitted in open court that former counsel had explained the States evidence and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction.  Toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecutions case.  Tocas conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyers ethical violations do not make the lawyer perse ineffective, and Tocas questionable conduct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.

				MIKE STANTON, PETITIONER v. DRENDOLYN SIMS
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 121217.Decided November 4, 2013
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Around one oclock in the morning on May 27, 2008, Officer Mike Stanton and his partner responded to a call about an unknown disturbance involving a person with a baseball bat in La Mesa, California.  App. to Pet. for  Cert. 6.  Stanton was familiar with the neighborhood, known for violence associated with the area gangs.  Ibid.  The officerswearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicleapproached the place where the disturbance had been reported and noticed three men walking in the street.  Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a nearby apartment complex.  The third, Nicholas Patrick, crossed the street about 25 yards in front of Stantons car and ran or quickly walked toward a residence.  Id., at 7, 17.  Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims.
			

				
				
				Stanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but  he considered Patricks behavior suspicious and decided  to detain him in order to investigate.  Ibid.; see Terry v. Ohio, 

392 U.S. 1 (1968)
.  Stanton exited his patrol car, called out police, and ordered Patrick to stop in a voice loud enough for all in the area to hear.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7.  But Patrick did not stop.  Instead, he looked directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly went through [the] front gate of a fence enclosing Sims front yard.  Id., at 17 (alterations omitted).  When the gate closed behind Patrick, the fencewhich was more than six feet tall and made of woodblocked Stantons view of the yard.  Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code 148 by disobeying his order to stop;
				[

				]
				 Stanton also fear[ed] for [his] safety.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7.  He accordingly made the split-second decision to kick open the gate in pursuit of Patrick.  Ibid.  Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate when it flew open.  The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder.
			

				
				
				Sims filed suit against Stanton in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. 1979, 

42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding that: (1) Stantons entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he fled, and by Sims lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home; and (2) even if a constitutional violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.  
			

				
				
				Sims appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  706 F.3d 954 (2013).  The court held that Stantons warrantless entry into Sims yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and because Patrick had committed only the minor offense of disobeying a police officer.  Id., at 959963.  The court also found the law to be clearly established that Stantons pursuit of Patrick did not justify his warrantless entry, given that Patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor.  Id., at 963964.  The court accordingly held that Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity.  Id., at 964965.  We address only the latter holding here, and now reverse.
			

				
				
				The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pearson v. Callahan, 

555 U.S. 223, 
231 (2009)
 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 

457 U.S. 800, 
818 (1982)
).  Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments, and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 

475 U.S. 335, 
341 (1986)
).  We do not require a case directly on point before concluding that the law is clearly established, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).
			

				
				
				There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution; the question is whether, in light of precedent existing at the time, he was plainly incompetent in entering Sims yard to pursue the fleeing Patrick.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The Ninth Circuit concluded that he was.  It did so despite the fact that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect.  Compare, e.g., Middletown v. Flinchum, 95 Ohio St. 3d 43, 45, 765 N.E. 2d 330, 332 (2002) (We ... hold today that when officers, having identified themselves, are in hot pursuit of a suspect who flees to a house in order to avoid arrest, the police may enter without a warrant, regardless of whether the offense for which the suspect is being arrested is a misdemeanor), and State v. Ricci, 144 N.H. 241, 244, 739 A.2d 404, 407 (1999) (the facts of this case demonstrate that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for the misdemeanor offense of dis- obeying a police officer where the defendant had fled  into his home with police officers in hot pursuit), with Mas- corro v. Billings, 656 F.3d 1198, 1207 (CA10 2011) (The warrantless entry based on hot pursuit was not justified where [t]he intended arrest was for a traffic misdemeanor committed by a minor, with whom the officer was well acquainted, who had fled into his family home from which there was only one exit (footnote omitted)), and Butler v. State, 309 Ark. 211, 217, 829 S.W. 2d 412, 415 (1992) (even though Officer Sudduth might have been under the impression that he was in continuous pursuit of Butler for what he considered to be the crime of disorderly conduct, ... since the crime is a minor offense, under these circumstances there is no exigent circumstance that would allow Officer Sudduths warrantless entry into Butlers home for what is concededly, at most, a petty disturbance).
			

				
				
				Other courts have concluded that police officers are at least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances because the constitutional violation is not clearly established.  E.g., Grenier v. Champlin, 27 F.3d 1346, 1354 (CA8 1994) (Putting firmly to one side the merits of whether the home arrests were constitutional, we cannot say that only a plainly incompetent policeman could have thought them permissible at the time, where officers entered a home without a warrant in hot pursuit of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers order to remain outside (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
			

				
				
				Notwithstanding this basic disagreement, the Ninth Circuit below denied Stanton qualified immunity.  In its one-paragraph analysis on the hot pursuit point, the panel relied on two cases, one from this Court, Welsh v. Wisconsin, 

466 U.S. 740, 
750 (1984)
, and one from its own, United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895, 908 (2001) (en banc)  (per curiam).  Neither case clearly establishes that Stanton violated Sims 
 
Fourth Amendment rights.
			

				
				
				In Welsh, police officers learned from a witness that Edward Welsh had driven his car off the road and then left the scene, presumably because he was drunk.  Acting on that tip, the officers went to Welshs home without a warrant, entered without consent, and arrested him for driving while intoxicateda nonjailable traffic offense under state law.  466 U.S., at 742743.  Our opinion first noted our precedent holding that hot pursuit of a fleeing felon justifies an officers warrantless entry.  Id., at 750 (citing United States v. Santana, 

427 U.S. 38
43 (1976)).  But we rejected the suggestion that the hot pursuit exception applied: there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of [Welsh] from the scene of a crime.  466 U.S., at 753.  We went on to conclude that the officers entry violated the 
 
Fourth Amendment, finding it important that there [was] probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . ha[d] been committed.  Ibid.  In those circumstances, we said, application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned.  Ibid.  But we did not lay down a categorical rule for all cases involving minor offenses, saying only that a warrant is usually required.  Id., at 750.
			

				
				
				In Johnson, police officers broke into Michael Johnsons fenced yard in search of another person (Steven Smith) whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor arrest warrants.  256 F.3d, at 898900.  The Ninth Circuit was clear that this case, like Welsh, did not involve hot pursuit: the facts of this case simply are not covered by the hot pursuit doctrine because Smith had escaped from the police 30 minutes prior and his where- abouts were unknown.  256 F.3d, at 908.  The court held that the officers entry required a warrant, in part because Smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses.  Then, in a footnote, the court said: In situations where an officer is truly in hot pursuit and the underlying offense is a felony, the 
 
Fourth Amendment usually yields [to law enforcements interest in apprehending a fleeing suspect].  See [Santana, supra, at 4243].  However, in situations where the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor, law enforcement must yield to the 
 
Fourth Amendment in all but the rarest cases.  Welsh, [supra, at 753].  Johnson, supra, at 908, n.6.
			

				
				
				In concludingas it must havethat Stanton was plainly incompetent, al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Ninth Circuit below read Welsh and the footnote in Johnson far too broadly.  First, both of those cases cited Santana with approval, a case that approved an officers warrantless entry while in hot pursuit.  And though Santana involved a felony suspect, we did not expressly limit our holding based on that fact.  See 427 U.S., at 42 (The only remaining question is whether [the suspects] act of retreating into her house could thwart an otherwise proper arrest.  We hold that it could not).  Second, to repeat, neither Welsh nor Johnson involved hot pursuit.  Welsh, supra, at 753; Johnson, supra, at 908.  Thus, despite our emphasis in Welsh on the fact that the crime at issue was minorindeed, a mere nonjailable civil offensenothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important in cases of hot pursuit.  Third, even in the portion of Welsh cited by the Ninth Circuit below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never justified, but only that such entry should be rare.  466 U.S., at 753.
			

				
				
				That is in fact how two California state courts have read Welsh.  In both People v. Lloyd, 216 Cal. App. 3d 1425, 1430, 265 Cal. Rptr. 422, 425 (1989), and Inre Lavoyne M., 221 Cal. App. 3d 154, 159, 270 Cal. Rptr. 394, 396 (1990), the California Court of Appeal refused to limit the hot pursuit exception to felony suspects.  The court stated in Lloyd: Where the pursuit into the home was based on an arrest set in motion in a public place, the fact that the offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the validity of the entry without a warrant.  216 Cal. App. 3d, at 1430, 265 Cal. Rptr., at 425.  It is especially troubling that the Ninth Circuit would conclude that Stanton was plainly incompetentand subject to personal liability for damagesbased on actions that were lawful according  to courts in the jurisdiction where he acted.  Cf. al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at 24).
			

				
				
				Finally, our determination that Welsh and Johnson are insufficient to overcome Stantons qualified immunity is bolstered by the fact that, even after Johnson, two different District Courts in the Ninth Circuit have granted qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established.  See Kolesnikov v. Sacramento County, No. S062155, 2008 WL 1806193, *7 (ED Cal., Apr. 22, 2008) (since Welsh, it has not been clearly established that there can never be warrantless home arrests in the context of a hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing from the commission of misdemeanor offenses); Garcia v. Imperial, No. 082357, 2010 WL 3834020, *6, n.4 (SD Cal., Sept. 28, 2010).  In Garcia, a case with facts similar to those here, the District Court distinguished Johnson as a case where the officers were not in hot pursuit of the suspect, had not seen the suspect enter the neighbors property, and had no real reason to think the suspect was there.  2010 WL 3834020, *6, n.4.  Precisely the same facts distinguish this case from Johnson: Stanton was in hot pursuit of Patrick, he did see Patrick enter Sims property, and he had every reason to believe that Patrick was just beyond Sims gate.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67, 17.
			

				
				
				To summarize the law at the time Stanton made his split-second decision to enter Sims yard: Two opinions of this Court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry; two opinions of the State Court of Appeal affirmatively authorized that entry; the most relevant opinion of the Ninth Circuit was readily distinguishable; two Federal District Courts in the Ninth Circuit had granted qualified immunity in the wake of that opinion; and the federal and state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply divided.
			

				
				
				We do not express any view on whether Officer Stantons entry into Sims yard in pursuit of Patrick was constitutional.  But whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct, it was not beyond debate.  al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but he was not plainly incompetent.  Malley, 475 U. S., at 341.
			

				
				
				The petition for certiorari and respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

			Officer Stanton and his partner responded to a call about a disturbance involving a person with a baseball bat. Stanton was familiar with the LaMesa neighborhood, known for gang violence. The officers, wearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicle, approached the location and noticed men walking in the street. Seeing the police car, two men turned into an apartment complex. Patrick crossed the street about 25 yards in front of Stantons car and ran toward a residence. Stanton did not see a baseball bat, but considered Patricks behavior suspicious and decided to investigate. Stanton exited his car, called out police, and ordered Patrick to stop. Patrick did not stop, but looked directly at Stanton, and went through the gate of the six-foot wooden fence enclosing Sims front yard. Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor by disobeying his order, fear[ed] for [his] safety and made the split-second decision to kick open the gate. Sims was behind the gate when it flew open, striking and injuring Sims. Sims sued, 42 U. S. C. 1983. The district court granted summary judgment to Stanton. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Stantons warrantless entry was unconstitutional because Sims had the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, there was no immediate danger, and Patrick had committed only a minor offense; under clearly established law Stantons pursuit of Patrick did not justify warrantless entry and Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity. The Supreme Court reversed, noting that courts nationwide are divided on whether an officer with probable cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect. The Ninth Circuit read too broadly Supreme Court precedent that did not involve hot pursuit. The Court did not determine whether Stantons entry was constitutional; Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but was not plainly incompetent.

				After the California Supreme Court held that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the California Constitution, state voters passed a ballot initiative known as Proposition 8, amending the State Constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.  Respondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, filed suit in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment, and naming as defendants Californias Governor and other state and local officials responsible for enforcing Californias marriage laws.  The officials refused to defend the law, so the District Court allowed petitionersthe initiatives official proponentsto intervene to defend it.  After a bench trial, the court declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional and enjoined the public officials named as defendants from enforcing the law.  Those officials elected not to appeal, but petitioners did.  The Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court: whether official proponents of a ballot initiative have authority to assert the States interest in defending the constitutionality of the initiative when public officials refuse to do so.  After the California Supreme Court answered in the affirmative, the Ninth Circuit concluded that petitioners had standing under federal law to defend Proposition 8s constitutionality.  On the merits, the court affirmed the District Courts order.
			

				Held:Petitioners did not have standing to appeal the District Courts order.  Pp.517.
			

				
				
				(a)Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual Cases or Controversies.  2.  One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so.  In other words, the litigant must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible harm.  Although most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when filing suit, Article III demands that an actual controversy persist throughout all stages of litigation.  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. ___, ___.  Standing must be met by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,

.  The parties do not contest that respondents had standing to initiate this case against the California officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8.  But once the District Court issued its order, respondents no longer had any injury to redress, and the state officials chose not to appeal.  The only individuals who sought to appeal were petitioners, who had intervened in the District Court, but they had not been ordered to do or refrain from doing anything.  Their only interest was to vindicate the constitutional validity of a generally applicable California law.  As this Court has repeatedly held, such a generalized grievanceno matter how sincereis insufficient to confer standing.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 

504 U.S. 555
574.  Petitioners claim that the California Constitution and election laws give them a unique, special, and distinct role in the initiative process, Reply Brief 5, but that is only true during the process of enacting the law.  Once Proposition 8 was approved, it became a duly enacted constitutional amendment.  Petitioners have no rolespecial or otherwisein its enforcement.  They therefore have no personal stake in defending its enforcement that is distinguishable from the general interest of every California citizen.  No matter how deeply committed petitioners may be to upholding Proposition 8, that is not a particularized interest sufficient to create a case or controversy under Article III.   Pp.59.

				(1)They claim that they may assert the States interest on the States behalf, but it is a fundamental restriction on our authority that [i]n the ordinary course, a litigant ... cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.  Powers v. Ohio,

, for example, a pediatrician engaged in private practice was not permitted to defend the constitutionality of Illinois abortion law after the State chose not to appeal an adverse ruling.  The state attorney generals letter of interest, explaining that the States interest in the proceeding was essentially co-terminous with Diamonds position, id., at 61, was insufficient, since Diamond was unable to assert an injury of his own, id, at 65.  Pp.910.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Petitioners contend the California Supreme Courts determination that they were authorized under California law to assert the States interest in the validity of Proposition 8 means that they need no more show a personal injury, separate from the States indisputable interest in the validity of its law, than would Californias Attorney General or did the legislative leaders held to have standing in Karcher v. May, 

484 U.S. 72 (1987)
.  Reply Brief 6.  But far from supporting petitioners standing, Karcher is compelling precedent against it.  In that case, after the New Jersey attorney general refused to defend the constitutionality of a state law, leaders of New Jerseys Legislature were permitted to appear, in their official capacities, in the District Court and Court of Appeals to defend the law.  What is significant about Karcher, however, is what happened after the Court of Appeals decision.  The legislators lost their leadership positions, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court.  The Court held that they could not do so.  Although they could participate in the lawsuit in their official capacities as presiding officers of the legislature, as soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing.  Id., at 81.  Petitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this litigation solely as private parties.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Nor is support found in dicta in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, supra.  There, in expressing grave doubts about the standing of ballot initiative sponsors to defend the constitutionality of an Arizona initiative, the Court noted that it was aware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.  Id., at 65.  Petitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Supreme Courts decision, they are authorized to act as agents of the people of California.  Brief for Petitioners 15.  But that Court never described petitioners as agents of the people.  All the California Supreme Courts decision stands for is that, so far as California is concerned, petitioners may assert legal arguments in defense of the states interest in the validity of the initiative measure in federal court.  628 F.3d 1191, 1193.  That interest is by definition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an interest that they lack standing under this Courts precedents.  Petitioners are also plainly not agents of the State.  As an initial matter, petitioners newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with their representations to the District Court, where they claimed to represent their own interests as official proponents.  More to the point, the basic features of an agency relationship are missing here: Petitioners are not subject to the control of any principal, and they owe no fiduciary obligation to anyone.  As one amicus puts it, the proponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspecified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to whatever extent they choose to defend it.  Brief for Walter Dellinger 23.  Pp.1316.
			

				
				
				(c)The Court does not question Californias sovereign right to maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to defend their initiatives in California courts.  But standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law.  No matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this Courts settled law to the contrary.  Article IIIs requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers.  States cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.  Pp.1617.

What is significant about Karcher, however, is what happened after the Court of Appeals decision.  The legislators lost their leadership positions, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court.  The Court held that they could not do so.  Although they could participate in the lawsuit in their official capacities as presiding officers of the legislature, as soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing.  Id., at 81.  Petitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this litigation solely as private parties.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Nor is support found in dicta in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, supra.  There, in expressing grave doubts about the standing of ballot initiative sponsors to defend the constitutionality of an Arizona initiative, the Court noted that it was aware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.  Id., at 65.  Petitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Supreme Courts decision, they are authorized to act as agents of the people of California.  Brief for Petitioners 15.  But that Court never described petitioners as agents of the people.  All the California Supreme Courts decision stands for is that, so far as California is concerned, petitioners may assert legal arguments in defense of the states interest in the validity of the initiative measure in federal court.  628 F.3d 1191, 1193.  That interest is by definition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an interest that they lack standing under this Courts precedents.  Petitioners are also plainly not agents of the State.  As an initial matter, petitioners newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with their representations to the District Court, where they claimed to represent their own interests as official proponents.  More to the point, the basic features of an agency relationship are missing here: Petitioners are not subject to the control of any principal, and they owe no fiduciary obligation to anyone.  As one amicus puts it, the proponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspecified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to whatever extent they choose to defend it.  Brief for Walter Dellinger 23.  Pp.1316.
			

				
				
				(c)The Court does not question Californias sovereign right to maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to defend their initiatives in California courts.  But standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law.  No matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this Courts settled law to the contrary.  Article IIIs requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers.  States cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.  Pp.1617.

			The California Supreme Court held that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the California Constitution; state voters then passed a ballot initiative, Proposition 8, amending the state constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Same-sex couples who wished to marry filed suit in federal court, challenging Proposition 8. State officials refused to defend the law, so the district court allowed the initiatives official proponents to intervene, declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional, and enjoined its enforcement. State officials declined to appeal. The intervenors appealed. The Ninth Circuit certified a question, which the California Supreme Court answered: official proponents of a ballot initiative have authority to assert the states interest to defend the constitutionality of the initiative when public officials refuse to do so. The Ninth Circuit concluded that petitioners had standing and affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding that the intervenors did not have standing to appeal.  Article III of the Constitution confines the power of federal courts to deciding actual Cases or Controversies. A litigant must demonstrate a personal and tangible harm throughout all stages of litigation.  The intervenors had standing to initiate this case against the California officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8, but once the district court issued its order, they no longer had any injury to redress and state officials chose not to appeal. The intervenors had not been ordered to do or refrain from doing anything. Their generalized grievance is insufficient to confer standing. The fact that a state thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override settled law to the contrary.

				UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR, executor of the ESTATE OF SPYER, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 12307.Argued March 27, 2013Decided June 26, 2013
			

				The State of New York recognizes the marriage of New York residents Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, who wed in Ontario, Canada, in 2007.  When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.  Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses, but was barred from doing so by 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which amended the Dictionary Acta law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and the whole realm of federal regulationsto define marriage and spouse as excluding same-sex partners.  Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service denied.  Windsor brought this refund suit, contending that DOMA violates the principles of equal protection incorporated in the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  While the suit was pending, the Attorney General notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend 3s constitutionality.  In response, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend 3s constitutionality.  The District Court permitted the intervention.  On the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding 3 unconstitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsors tax with interest.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  The United States has not complied with the judgment.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.This Court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.  This case clearly presented a concrete disagreement between opposing parties that was suitable for judicial resolution in the District Court, but the Executives decision not to defend 3s constitutionality in court while continuing to deny refunds and assess deficiencies introduces a complication.  Given the Governments concession, amicus contends, once the District Court ordered the refund, the case should have ended and the appeal been dismissed.  But this argument elides the distinction between Article IIIs jurisdictional requirements and the prudential limits on its exercise, which are essentially matters of judicial self-governance.  Warth v. Seldin, 

422 U.S. 490
.  Here, the United States retains a stake sufficient to support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in this Court.  The refund it was ordered to pay Windsor is a real and immediate economic injury, Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 

551 U.S. 587
, even if the Executive disagrees with 3 of DOMA.  Windsors ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.  Cf. INS v. Chadha, 

462 U.S. 919
.
			

				
				
				Prudential considerations, however, demand that there be concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.  Baker v. Carr, 

369 U.S. 186
.  Unlike Article III requirementswhich must be satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is appropriateprudential factors that counsel against hearing this case are subject to countervailing considerations [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.  Warth, supra, at 500501.  One such consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the issues is ensured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with vigor the legislative acts constitutionality.  See Chadha, supra, at 940.  Here, BLAGs substantial adversarial argument for 3s constitutionality satisfies prudential concerns that otherwise might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which the principal parties agree.  This conclusion does not mean that it is appropriate for the Executive as a routine exercise to challenge statutes in court instead of making the case to Congress for amendment or repeal.  But this case is not routine, and BLAGs capable defense ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which is of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to hundreds of thousands of persons.  Pp.513.
			

				
				
				2.DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that is protected by the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  Pp.1326.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)By history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States.  Congress has enacted discrete statutes to regulate the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy, but  DOMA, with a directive applicable to over 1,000 federal statues and the whole realm of federal regulations, has a far greater reach.  Its operation is also directed to a class of persons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect.  Assessing the validity of that intervention requires discussing the historical and traditional extent of state power and authority over marriage.
			

				
				
				Subject to certain constitutional guarantees, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 

388 U.S. 1
, regulation of domestic relations is an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States, Sosna v. Iowa, 

419 U.S. 393
.  The significance of state responsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to the Nations beginning; for when the Constitution was adopted the common understanding was that the domestic relations of husband and wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States, Ohio exrel. Popovici v. Agler, 

280 U.S. 379
384.  Marriage laws may vary from State to State, but they are consistent within each State.
			

				
				
				DOMA rejects this long-established precept.  The States decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.  But the Federal Government uses the state-defined class for the opposite purposeto impose restrictions and disabilities.  The question is whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty protected by the 
 
Fifth Amendment, since what New York treats as alike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the same class the State seeks to protect.  New Yorks actions were a proper exercise of its sovereign authority.  They reflect both the communitys considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning of equality.  Pp.1320.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)By seeking to injure the very class New York seeks to protect, DOMA violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government.  The Constitutions guarantee of equality must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot justify disparate treatment of that group.  Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 

413 U.S. 528
535.  DOMA cannot survive under these principles.  Its unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage operates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages.  This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law.  DOMAs avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.
			

				
				
				DOMAs history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute.  It was its essence.  BLAGs arguments are just as candid about the congressional purpose.   DOMAs operation in practice confirms this purpose.  It frustrates New Yorks objective of eliminating inequality by writing inequality into the entire United States Code.
			

				
				
				DOMAs principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of state-sanctioned marriages.  It contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State.  It also forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.  Pp.2026.

			Windsor and Spyer, two women, married in Canada in 2007. Their home state, New York, recognized the marriage. Spyer died in 2009 and left her estate to Windsor, who sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses. Her claim was barred by section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 28 U.S.C. 1738C, which defined marriage and spouse to exclude same-sex partners for purposes of federal law. Windsor paid $363,053 in taxes and sought a refund, which the IRS denied. Windsor sued, challenging DOMA. The Department of Justice declined to defend section 3s constitutionality. The district court ordered a refund, finding section 3 unconstitutional. The Second Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court affirmed, 5-4, first holding that the government retained a stake, sufficient to support Article III jurisdiction, because the unpaid refund is a real and immediate economic injury.  There was sufficient argument for section 3s constitutionality to satisfy prudential concerns. DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of persons under the Fifth Amendment. Regulation of marriage has traditionally been within the authority of the states. DOMA, applicable to more than 1,000 federal statues and all federal regulations, was directed to a class of persons that the laws of New York and 11 other states have sought to protect. DOMA is inconsistent with the principle that marriage laws may vary from state to state, but are consistent within each state. A states decision to give a class of persons the right to marry confers a dignity and status of immense import. New Yorks decision was a proper exercise of its sovereign authority. By seeking to injure the class New York seeks to protect, DOMA violated basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the federal government. Constitutional guarantees of equality must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot justify disparate treatment of the group. DOMAs history and text indicate a purpose and practical effect to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and a stigma upon those entering into same-sex marriages made lawful by the states. The law deprived some couples married under the laws of their states, but not others, of rights and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same state; it diminished the stability and predictability of basic personal relations.

				No. 12357.Argued April 23, 2013Decided June 26, 2013
			

				Investments for the employee pension fund of the State of New York and its local governments are chosen by the funds sole trustee, the State Comptroller.  After the Comptrollers general counsel recommended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ventures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to disclose information about the general counsels alleged affair to his wife, government officials, and the media.  Some of the e-mails were traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing partner of FA Technology Ventures.  Petitioner was convicted of attempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 

18 U.S.C. 1951(a), which defines extortion to mean the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right, 1951(b)(2).  The jury specified that the property petitioner attempted to extort was the general counsels recommendation to approve the investment.  The Second Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer approve an investment does not constitute the obtaining of property from another under the Hobbs Act.  Pp.39.
			

				
				
				(a)Absent other indication, Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.  Neder v. United States, 

527 U.S. 1
.  As far as is known, no case predating the Hobbs ActEnglish, federal, or stateever identified conduct such as that charged here as extortionate.  Extortion required the obtaining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim.  The Acts text confirms that obtaining property requires not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property.  Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 

537 U.S. 393
.  The property extorted must therefore be transferablethat is, capable of passing from one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged property here.  The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.  Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a 1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that statute.  And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that occurred here was coercion.  Finally, this Courts own precedent demands reversal of petitioners convictions.  See id., at 404405.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(b)The Governments defense of the theory of conviction is unpersuasive.  No fluent speaker of English would say that petitioner obtained and exercised the general counsels right to make a recommendation, any more than he would say that a person obtained and exercised anothers right to free speech.  He would say that petitioner forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation, just as he would say that a person forced another to make a statement.  Adopting the Governments theory here would not only make nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore Congresss choice to penalize one but not the other.

No fluent speaker of English would say that petitioner obtained and exercised the general counsels right to make a recommendation, any more than he would say that a person obtained and exercised anothers right to free speech.  He would say that petitioner forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation, just as he would say that a person forced another to make a statement.  Adopting the Governments theory here would not only make nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore Congresss choice to penalize one but not the other.

			The Comptroller is sole trustee and chooses investments for the employee pension fund of the state of New York and its local governments. The Comptrollers general counsel recommended against investing in a fund managed by FA; the general counsel then received anonymous e-mails demanding that he recommend the investment and threatening to disclose information about the general counsels alleged affair. Some of the e-mails were traced to the home computer of Sekhar, a managing partner of FA, who was convicted of attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. 1951(a). The Act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right. The jury specified that the property at issue was the general counsels recommendation to approve the investment. The Second Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed. Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer approve an investment does not constitute the obtaining of property from another under the Hobbs Act. Congress generally intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses. Extortion historically required the obtaining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim. The Acts text requires not only deprivation, but the acquisition of property; the property, therefore, must be transferable. No fluent English-speaker would say that petitioner obtained and exercised the general counsels right to make a recommendation, any more than he would say that a person obtained and exercised anothers right to free speech.

				KOONTZ v. ST.JOHNS RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of florida
			

				No. 111447.Argued January 15, 2013Decided June 25, 2013
			

				Coy Koontz, Sr., whose estate is represented here by petitioner, sought permits to develop a section of his property from respondent St. Johns River Water Management District (District), which, consistent with Florida law, requires permit applicants wishing to build on wetlands to offset the resulting environmental damage.  Koontz offered to mitigate the environmental effects of his development proposal by deeding to the District a conservation easement on nearly three-quarters of his property.  The District rejected Koontzs proposal and informed him that it would approve construction only if he (1) reduced the size of his development and, inter alia, deeded to the District a conservation easement on the resulting larger remainder of his property or (2) hired contractors to make improvements to District-owned wetlands several miles away.  Believing the Districts demands to be excessive in light of the environmental effects his proposal would have caused, Koontz filed suit under a state law that provides money damages for agency action that is an unreasonable exercise of the states police power constituting a taking without just compensation.
			

				
				
				
				
				The trial court found the Districts actions unlawful because they failed the requirements of Nollan v. California Coastal Commn, 

483 U.S. 825
, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 

512 U.S. 374
.  Those cases held that the government may not condition the approval of a land-use permit on the owners relinquishment of a portion of his property unless there is a nexus and rough proportionality between the governments demand and the effects of the proposed land use.  The District Court of Appeal affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed on two grounds.  First, it held that petitioners claim failed because, unlike in Nollan or Dolan, the District denied the application.  Second, the State Supreme Court held that a demand for money cannot give rise to a claim under Nollan and Dolan.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The governments demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit.  Pp.614.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The unconstitutional conditions doctrine vindicates the Constitutions enumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people into giving them up, and Nollan and Dolan represent a special application of this doctrine that protects the 
 
Fifth Amendment right to just compensation for property the government takes when owners apply for land-use permits.  The standard set out in Nollan and Dolan reflects the danger of governmental coercion in this context while accommodating the governments legitimate need to offset the public costs of development through land use exactions.  Dolan, supra, at 391; Nollan, supra, at 837.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The principles that undergird Nollan and Dolan do not change depending on whether the government approves a permit on the condition that the applicant turn over property or denies a permit because the applicant refuses to do so.  Recognizing such a distinction would enable the government to evade the Nollan/Dolan limitations simply by phrasing its demands for property as conditions precedent to permit approval.  This Courts unconstitutional conditions cases have long refused to attach significance to the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.  See, e.g., Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commn of Cal., 

271 U.S. 583
593.  It makes no difference that no property was actually taken in this case.  Extortionate demands for property in the land-use permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because they take property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have property taken without just compensation.  Nor does it matter that the District might have been able to deny Koontzs application outright without giving him the option of securing a permit by agreeing to spend money improving public lands.  It is settled that the unconstitutional conditions doctrine applies even when the government threatens to withhold a gratuitous benefit.  See e.g., United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 

539 U.S. 194
.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)The District concedes that the denial of a permit could give rise to a valid Nollan/Dolan claim, but urges that this Court should not review this particular denial because Koontz sued in the wrong court, for the wrong remedy, and at the wrong time.  Most of its arguments raise questions of state law.  But to the extent that respondent alleges a federal obstacle to adjudication of petitioners claim, the Florida courts can consider respondents arguments in the first instance on remand.  Finally, the District errs in arguing that because it gave Koontz another avenue to obtain permit approval, this Court need not decide whether its demand for offsite improvements satisfied Nollan and Dolan.  Had Koontz been offered at least one alternative that satisfied Nollan and Dolan, he would not have been subjected to an unconstitutional condition.  But the Districts offer to approve a less ambitious project does not obviate the need to apply Nollan and Dolan to the conditions it imposed on its approval of the project Koontz actually proposed.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				2.The governments demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when its demand is for money.  Pp.1422.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Contrary to respondents argument, Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 

524 U.S. 498
, where five Justices concluded that the Takings Clause does not apply to government-imposed financial obligations that d[o] not operate upon or alter an identified property interest, id., at 540 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), does not control here, where the demand for money did burden the ownership of a specific parcel of land.  Because of the direct link between the governments demand and a specific parcel of real property, this case implicates the central concern of Nollan and Dolan: the risk that the government may deploy its substantial power and discretion in land-use permitting to pursue governmental ends that lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to the effects of the proposed use of the property at issue.  Pp.1518.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The District argues that if monetary exactions are subject to Nollan/Dolan scrutiny, then there will be no principled way of distinguishing impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes.  But the District exaggerates both the extent to which that problem is unique to the land-use permitting context and the practical difficulty of distinguishing between the power to tax and the power to take by eminent domain.  It is beyond dispute that [t]axes and user fees ... are not takings, Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 

538 U.S. 216
, n.2, yet this Court has repeatedly found takings where the government, by confiscating financial obligations, achieved a result that could have been obtained through taxation, e.g., id., at 232.  Pp.1821.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)The Courts holding that monetary exactions are subject to scrutiny under Nollan and Dolan will not work a revolution in land use law or unduly limit the discretion of local authorities to implement sensible land use regulations.  The rule that Nollan and Dolan apply to monetary exactions has been the settled law in some of our Nations most populous States for many years, and the protections of those cases are often redundant with the requirements of state law.  Pp.2122.

			In 1972 Koontz bought 14.9 undeveloped acres. Florida subsequently enacted the 1972 Water Resources Act, requiring a permit with conditions to ensure that construction will not be harm water resources and the 1984 Henderson Wetlands Protection Act, making it illegal to dredge or fill in, on, or over surface waters without a wetlands permit. The District with jurisdiction over the Koontz land requires that applicants wishing to build on wetlands offset environmental damage by creating, enhancing, or preserving wetlands elsewhere. Koontz decided to develop 3.7-acres. In 1994 he proposed to raise a section of his land to make it suitable for building and installing a stormwater pond. To mitigate environmental effects, Koontz offered to foreclose development of 11 acres by deeding to the District a conservation easement. The District rejected Koontzs proposal and indicated that it would approve construction only if he reduced the size of his development and deeded a conservation easement on the larger remaining property or hired contractors to improve District wetlands miles away. Koontz sued under a state law that provides damages for agency action that constitutes a taking without just compensation. The trial court found the Districts actions unlawful under the requirements of Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard, that the government may not condition permit approval on the owners relinquishment of a portion of his property unless there is a nexus and rough proportionality between the demand and the effects of the proposed use. The court of appeal affirmed, but the Florida Supreme Court reversed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that a governmental demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit. The Nollan/Dolan standard reflects the danger of governmental coercion in the land-use permitting context while accommodating the legitimate need to offset public costs of development through land use exactions. It makes no difference that the Koontz property was not actually taken. It does not matter that the District might have been able to deny Koontzs application outright without giving him the option of securing a permit by agreeing to spend money improving public lands. Even a demand for money from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements; there is a direct link between the demand and a specific parcel of real property. The Court rejected arguments that applying Nollan/Dolan scrutiny to money exactions will leave no principled way of distinguishing impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes, stating that its holding will not work a revolution in land use law or unduly limit the discretion of local authorities to implement sensible land use regulations.

				No. 12399.Argued April 16, 2013Decided June 25, 2013
			

				The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which establishes federal standards for state-court child custody proceedings involving Indian children, was enacted to address the consequences ... of abusive child welfare practices that [separated] Indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in non-Indian homes, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 

490 U.S. 30
.  As relevant here, the ICWA bars involuntary termination of a parents rights in the absence of a heightened showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from the parents continued custody of the child, 

25 U.S.C. 1912(f); conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, 1912(d); and provides placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members of the childs extended family, other members of the Indian childs tribe, and other Indian families, 1915(a).
			

				
				
				
				
				While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Fathers child, their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights.  Birth Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South Carolina.  For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four months after Baby Girls birth, Biological Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl.  About four months after Baby Girls birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of the pending adoption.  In the adoption proceedings, Biological Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adoption.  Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couples adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father.  At the age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father, whom she had never met.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a parent under the ICWA; that 1912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, 1915(a)s adoptionplacement preferences would have applied.  
			

				Held: 
			

				
				
				1.Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a parent under the ICWA, neither 1912(f) nor 1912(d) bars the termination of his parental rights.  Pp.614.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of parental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the parents continued custody of the child.  The adjective continued plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary definitions.  The phrase continued custody thus refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past).  As a result, 1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.  This reading comports with the statutory text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian families.  See 1901(4).  But the ICWAs primary goal is not implicated when an Indian childs adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights.  Nonbinding guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate that the BIA envisioned that 1912(f)s standard would apply only to termination of a custodial parents rights.  Under this reading, Biological Father should not have been able to invoke 1912(f) in this case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl as of the time of the adoption proceedings.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Section 1912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services ... designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.  Consistent with this text, 1912(d) applies only when an Indian familys breakup would be precipitated by terminating parental rights.  The term breakup refers in this context to [t]he discontinuance of a relationship, American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or an ending as an effective entity, Websters Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961).  But when an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parents legal or physical custody, there is no relationship to be discontinu[ed] and no effective entity to be end[ed] by terminating the Indian parents rights.  In such a situation, the breakup of the Indian family has long since occurred, and 1912(d) is inapplicable.  This interpretation is consistent with the explicit congressional purpose of setting certain standards for the removal of Indian children from their families, 1902, and with BIA Guidelines.  Section 1912(d)s proximity to 1912(e) and (f), which both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian childs continued custody with his parent, strongly suggests that the phrase breakup of the Indian family should be read in harmony with the continued custody requirement.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				2.Section 1915(a)s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child.  No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court.  Biological Father is not covered by 1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place.  And custody was never sought by Baby Girls paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families.  Pp.1416.

Pp.711.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Section 1912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services ... designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.  Consistent with this text, 1912(d) applies only when an Indian familys breakup would be precipitated by terminating parental rights.  The term breakup refers in this context to [t]he discontinuance of a relationship, American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or an ending as an effective entity, Websters Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961).  But when an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parents legal or physical custody, there is no relationship to be discontinu[ed] and no effective entity to be end[ed] by terminating the Indian parents rights.  In such a situation, the breakup of the Indian family has long since occurred, and 1912(d) is inapplicable.  This interpretation is consistent with the explicit congressional purpose of setting certain standards for the removal of Indian children from their families, 1902, and with BIA Guidelines.  Section 1912(d)s proximity to 1912(e) and (f), which both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian childs continued custody with his parent, strongly suggests that the phrase breakup of the Indian family should be read in harmony with the continued custody requirement.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				2.Section 1915(a)s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child.  No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court.  Biological Father is not covered by 1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place.  And custody was never sought by Baby Girls paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families.  Pp.1416.
			

				398 S.C. 625, 731 S.E. 2d 550, reversed and remanded.

			The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) establishes federal standards for state-court custody proceedings involving Indian children. It bars involuntary termination of parental rights absent a heightened showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from the parents continued custody of the child, 25 U.S.C. 1912(f); conditions involuntary termination of parental rights on showing that remedial efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, (1912(d)); and provides preferences for adoption of Indian children to extended family, members of the tribe, and other Indian families, (1915(a)). Before Baby Girls birth, Biological Father, a member of the Cherokee Nation, agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private agency and selected non-Indian adoptive parents. During the pregnancy and the first four months of Baby Girls life, Biological Father provided no financial assistance. Four months after the birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of the pending adoption. Biological Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adoption. South Carolina Family Court denied the adoption petition and awarded Biological Father custody. At the age of 27 months, Baby Girl was given to Biological Father, whom she had never met. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, stating that, assuming that Biological Father is a parent under the ICWA, that law does not bar termination of his parental rights. Continued custody refers to custody that a parent already has or at least has had; section 1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had custody. Section 1912(d) conditions involuntary termination of parental rights on a showing of efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family; the section applies only when the breakup would be precipitated by terminating parental rights. When an Indian parent abandons an Indian child before birth and that child has never been in that parents  custody, the breakup of the Indian family has long since occurred, and section 1912(d) is inapplicable. Section 1915(a)s placement preferences are inapplicable if no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child. Biological Father did not seek to adopt, but only argued that his parental rights should not be terminated.

				No. 1296.Argued February 27, 2013Decided June 25, 2013
			

				The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 

383 U.S. 301
.  Section 2 of the Act, which bans any standard, practice, or procedure that results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen ... to vote on account of race or color, 

42 U.S.C. 1973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and is not at issue in this case.  Other sections apply only to some parts of the country.  Section 4 of the Act provides the coverage formula, defining the covered jurisdictions as States or political subdivisions that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.  1973b(b).  In those covered jurisdictions, 5 of the Act provides that no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by specified federal authorities in Washington, D.C.  1973c(a).  Such approval is known as preclearance.
			

				
				
				
				
				The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized several times.  In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but the coverage formula was not changed.  Coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or 1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time.  Shortly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to bail out from the Acts coverage and, in the alternative, challenged the Acts constitutionality.  This Court resolved the challenge on statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Acts continued constitutionality.  See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 

557 U.S. 193
.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama, sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against their enforcement.  The District Court upheld the Act, finding that the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing 5 and continuing 4(b)s coverage formula.  The D.C. Circuit affirmed.  After surveying the evidence in the record, that court accepted Congresss conclusion that 2 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, that 5 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage formula continued to pass constitutional muster.
			

				Held:Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.  Pp.925. 
			

				
				
				(a)In Northwest Austin, this Court noted that the Voting Rights Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs and concluded that a departure from the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statutes disparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.  557 U.S., at 203.  These basic principles guide review of the question presented here.  Pp.917.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)State legislation may not contravene federal law.  States retain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and pursuing legislative objectives.  Indeed, the 
 
Tenth Amendment reserves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal Government, including the power to regulate elections.  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 

501 U.S. 452
462.  There is also a fundamental principle of equal sovereignty among the States, which is highly pertinent in assessing disparate treatment of States.  Northwest Austin, supra, at 203.
			

				
				
				The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.  It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own.  And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).  That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as stringent and potent, Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 308, 315, 337.  The Court nonetheless upheld the Act, concluding that such an uncommon exercise of congressional power could be justified by exceptional conditions.  Id., at 334.  Pp.912.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)In 1966, these departures were justified by the blight of racial discrimination in voting that had infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century, Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 308.  At the time, the coverage formulathe means of linking the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that warranted itmade sense.  The Act was limited to areas where Congress found evidence of actual voting discrimination, and the covered jurisdictions shared two characteristics: the use of tests and devices for voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential election at least 12 points below the national average.  Id., at 330.  The Court explained that [t]ests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.  Ibid.  The Court therefore concluded that the coverage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.  Ibid.  Pp.1213.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.  Largely because of the Voting Rights Act, [v]oter turnout and registration rates in covered jurisdictions now approach parity.  Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare.  And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.  Northwest Austin, supra, at 202.  The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years.  Yet the Act has not eased 5s restrictions or narrowed the scope of 4s coverage formula along the way.  Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they have grown even stronger.  Because 5 applies only to those jurisdictions singled out by 4, the Court turns to consider that provision.  Pp.1317.
			

				
				
				(b)Section 4s formula is unconstitutional in light of current conditions.  Pp.1725.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)In 1966, the coverage formula was rational in both practice and theory.  Katzenbach, supra, at 330.  It looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.  By 2009, however, the coverage formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.  Northwest Austin, supra, at 204.  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices.  The formula captures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s.  But such tests have been banned for over 40 years.  And voter registration and turnout numbers in covered States have risen dramatically.  In 1965, the States could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter registration and turnout and those without those characteristics.  Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.  Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.  Pp.1718.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds that it is reverse-engineeredCongress identified the jurisdictions to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them.  Katzenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that the coverage formula was rational because the formula ... was relevant to the problem.  383 U.S., at 329, 330.  The Government has a fallback argumentbecause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the States identified in 1965.  But this does not look to current political conditions, Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a comparison between the States in 1965.  But history did not end in 1965.  In assessing the current need[] for a preclearance system treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965 cannot be ignored.  The 
 
Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.  To serve that purpose, Congressif it is to divide the Statesmust identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.  Pp.1821.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record compiled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act.  Regardless of how one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the pervasive, flagrant, widespread, and rampant discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation in 1965.  Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331.  But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current conditions.  It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.  Pp.2122.

			The Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 1973(a), was enacted to address racial discrimination in voting. Section 2 bans any standard, practice, or procedure that results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen ... to vote on account of race or color, applies nationwide, and is permanent. Other sections apply to some parts of the country. Section 4 defines covered jurisdictions as states or political subdivisions that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting and had low voter registration or turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. Section 5 provides that no change in voting procedures can take effect in covered jurisdictions until approved by federal authorities (preclearance). The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were to expire after five years, but the Act was reauthorized. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test and low registration or turnout almost 50 years ago. Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama, sought a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are facially unconstitutional. The district court upheld the Act. The D. C. Circuit affirmed. A 5-4 Supreme Court reversed, finding Section 4 unconstitutional. Its formula may not be used to require preclearance. States have broad autonomy in structuring their governments and pursuing legislative objectives; the Tenth Amendment reserves to states the power to regulate elections. There is a fundamental principle of equal sovereignty among the states. The Voting Rights Act departs from those principles by requiring states to request federal permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute. The Act applies to only nine states (and additional counties).  In 1966, the departures were justified by racial discrimination that had infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century so that the coverage formula was rational in practice and theory. Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically. Voter turnout and registration rates in covered jurisdictions approach parity; blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. Minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels. Congress, if it is to continue to divide the states, must identify jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense under current conditions. Data compiled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act did not show anything like the pervasive, rampant discrimination found in covered jurisdictions in 1965. Congress reenacted the formula based on 40-year-old facts with no logical relation to the present day.

				FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 11345.Argued October 10, 2012Decided June 24, 2013
			

				The University of Texas at Austin considers race as one of various factors in its undergraduate admissions process.  The University, which is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 

539 U.S. 306
, upholding the use of race as one of many plus factors in an admissions program that considered the overall individual contribution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 

539 U.S. 244
, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automatically awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the Universitys 2008 entering class.  She sued the University and school officials, alleging that the Universitys consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the University.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversitys benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal.  Applying that standard, the court upheld the Universitys admissions plan.
			

				Held:Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 

438 U.S. 265
, its decision affirming the District Courts grant of summary judgment to the University was incorrect.  Pp.513.
			

				
				
				(a)Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.  In Bakkes principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state university decisions based on race or ethnic origin ... are reviewable under the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment, 438 U.S., at 287, using a strict scrutiny standard, id., at 299.  He identified as a compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.  Id., at 315
			

				
				
				In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e., a university must clearly demonstrate that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary ... to the accomplishment of its purpose, Bakke, supra, at 305.  Additional guidance may be found in the Courts broader equal protection jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Rice v. Cayetano, 

528 U.S. 495
; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 

488 U.S. 469

				(b)Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using racial categories or classifications.  A court may give some deference to a universitys judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission, 539 U.S., at 328, provided that diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision.  On this point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for deference to the Universitys experience and expertise about its educational mission.  However, once the University has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are narrowly tailored to its goal.  On this point, the University receives no deference.  Id., at 333.  It is at all times the Universitys obligation to demonstrate, and the Judiciarys obligation to determine, that admissions processes ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.  Id., at 337.  Narrow tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is necessary for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.  Bakke, supra, at 305.  The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.
			

				
				
				Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit held petitioner could challenge only whether the Universitys decision to use race as an admissions factor was made in good faith.  It presumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption.  It thus undertook the narrow-tailoring requirement with a degree of deference to the school.  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grutters command that all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.  539 U.S., at 326.  Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here.  The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment.  But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis.  In determining whether summary judgment in the Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.

				FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 11345.Argued October 10, 2012Decided June 24, 2013
			

				The University of Texas at Austin considers race as one of various factors in its undergraduate admissions process.  The University, which is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 

539 U.S. 306
, upholding the use of race as one of many plus factors in an admissions program that considered the overall individual contribution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 

539 U.S. 244
, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automatically awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the Universitys 2008 entering class.  She sued the University and school officials, alleging that the Universitys consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the University.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversitys benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal.  Applying that standard, the court upheld the Universitys admissions plan.
			

				Held:Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 

438 U.S. 265
, its decision affirming the District Courts grant of summary judgment to the University was incorrect.  Pp.513.
			

				
				
				(a)Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.  In Bakkes principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state university decisions based on race or ethnic origin ... are reviewable under the 
 
Fourteenth Amendment, 438 U.S., at 287, using a strict scrutiny standard, id., at 299.  He identified as a compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.  Id., at 315
			

				
				
				In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e., a university must clearly demonstrate that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary ... to the accomplishment of its purpose, Bakke, supra, at 305.  Additional guidance may be found in the Courts broader equal protection jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Rice v. Cayetano, 

528 U.S. 495
; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 

488 U.S. 469
.  Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the government bears the burden to prove that the reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.  Ibid.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using racial categories or classifications.  A court may give some deference to a universitys judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission, 539 U.S., at 328, provided that diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision.  On this point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for deference to the Universitys experience and expertise about its educational mission.  However, once the University has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are narrowly tailored to its goal.

			Since the Courts 2003 decision, Grutter v. Bollinger, the University of Texas at Austin has considered race as a factor in undergraduate admissions. A Caucasian, rejected for admission, sued, alleging that consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The district court granted summary judgment to the University. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, reasoning that the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Supreme Court precedent. A university must clearly demonstrate that its purpose or interest is constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose, and that the reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate. A court may give some deference to a universitys judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission, if diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision. The University must prove that the means it chose to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to its goal and that admissions processes ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application. A reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternative would produce the educational benefits of diversity. The Fifth Circuit simply presumed that the school acted in good faith and gave the plaintiff the burden of rebutting that presumption. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice. On remand, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.

				VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIVERSITY etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
			

				No. 11556.Argued November 26, 2012Decided June 24, 2013
			

				Under Title VII, an employers liability for workplace harassment may depend on the status of the harasser.  If the harassing employee is the victims co-worker, the employer is liable only if it was negligent in controlling working conditions.  In cases in which the harasser is a supervisor, however, different rules apply.  If the supervisors harassment culminates in a tangible employment action (i.e., a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits, Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 

524 U. S. 742
), the employer is strictly liable.  But if no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may escape liability by establishing, as an affirmative defense, that (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the employer provided.  Faragher v. Boca Raton, 

524 U.S. 775
; Ellerth, supra, at 765.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Vance, an African-American woman, sued her employer, Ball State University (BSU) alleging that a fellow employee, Saundra Davis, created a racially hostile work environment in violation of Title VII.  The District Court granted summary judgment to BSU.  It held that BSU was not vicariously liable for Davis alleged actions because Davis, who could not take tangible employment actions against Vance, was not a supervisor.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed. 
			

				Held:An employee is a supervisor for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII only if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.  Pp.930.
			

				
				
				(a)Petitioner errs in relying on the meaning of supervisor in general usage and in other legal contexts because the term has varying meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law.  In any event, Congress did not use the term supervisor in Title VII, and the way to understand the terms meaning for present purposes is to consider the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured framework adopted in Faragher and Ellerth.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(b)Petitioner misreads Faragher and Ellerth in claiming that those cases support an expansive definition of supervisor because, in her view, at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom the Court treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Circuits definition demands.  In Ellerth, there was no question that the alleged harasser, who hired and promoted his victim, was a supervisor.  And in Faragher, the parties never disputed the characterization of the alleged harassers as supervisors, so the question simply was not before the Court.  Pp.1418.
			

				
				
				(c)The answer to the question presented in this case is implicit in the characteristics of the framework that the Court adopted in Ellerth and Faragher, which draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors and implies that the authority to take tangible employment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor.  Ellerth, supra, at 762.
			

				
				
				The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor adopted today is one that can be readily applied.  An alleged harassers supervisor status will often be capable of being discerned before (or soon after) litigation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law before trial.  By contrast, the vagueness of the EEOCs standard would impede the resolution of the issue before trial, possibly requiring the jury to be instructed on two very different paths of analysis, depending on whether it finds the alleged harasser to be a supervisor or merely a co-worker.
			

				
				
				This approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily tasks.  In such cases, a victim can prevail simply by showing that the employer was negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor in determining negligence.  Pp.1825.
			

				
				
				(d)The definition adopted today accounts for the fact that many modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with respect to work assignments.  Petitioner fears that employers will attempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment actions, but a broad definition of supervisor is not necessary to guard against that concern.  Pp.2526.
			

				646 F.3d 461, affirmed.

			Under Title VII (42 U.S.C. 2000e2(a)(1)), an employers liability for workplace harassment may depend on the status of the harasser. If the harassing employee is the victims co-worker, the employer is liable only if it was negligent in controlling working conditions. If the harasser is a supervisor, however, and the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, the employer is strictly liable. If there was no tangible employment action, the employer may escape liability by establishing that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassing behavior and that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer. Vance, an African-American woman, sued her employer, BSU, alleging that a fellow employee, Davis, created a racially hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. The district court entered summary judgment, holding that BSU was not vicariously liable for Davis alleged actions because Davis, who could not take tangible employment actions against Vance, was not a supervisor. The Seventh Circuit and Supreme Court affirmed.  An employee is a ""supervisor"" for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII only if empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. A definition that draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors, with the authority to take tangible employment actions as the defining characteristic of a supervisor, can be readily applied. Supervisor status will often be discerned before or soon after litigation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law before trial. This definition will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily tasks and accounts for the fact that many modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with respect to assignments.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				CHARLES L. RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART-MENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETITIONER v. EDWARD HAROLD SCHAD
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 121084.Decided June 24, 2013
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  After an extensive series of state- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this Courts denial of respondents petitions for certiorari and for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D).  The Ninth Circuit instead, suasponte, construed respondents motion to stay the mandate pending the Ninth Circuits decision in a separate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier.  Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a few days before respondents scheduled execution.  Even assuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 

545 U.S. 794 (2005)
, that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its mandate.  As a result, we conclude that the Ninth Circuits failure to issue its mandate constituted an abuse of discretion.
			

				I
			

				
				
				In 1985, an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder for the 1978 strangling of 74-year-old Lorimer Grove.
				[
					1
				]
				  The court sentenced respondent to death.  After respondents conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review, see State v. Schad, 163 Ariz. 411, 788 P.2d 1162 (1989), and Schad v. Arizona, 

501 U.S. 624 (1991)
, respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleging that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient mitigating evidence.  The state courts denied relief.
			

				
				
				In August 1998, respondent sought federal habeas relief.  He again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sentencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence.  The District Court denied respondents request for an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi- dence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in developing the evidence during his state habeas proceedings.  Schad v. Schriro, 454 F.Supp. 2d 897 (Ariz. 2006).  The District Court alternatively held that the proffered new evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsels performance was deficient.  Id., at 940947.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether respondents state habeas counsel was diligent in developing the state evidentiary record.  Schad v. Ryan, 606 F.3d 1022 (2010).  Arizona petitioned for certiorari.  This Court granted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuits opinion, and remanded for further proceedings in light of Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. ___ (2011).  See Ryan v. Schad, 563 U.S. ___ (2011).  On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Courts denial of habeas relief.  Schad v. Ryan, 671 F.3d 708, 726 (2011).  The Ninth Circuit subsequently denied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on February 28, 2012.
			

				
				
				On July 10, 2012, respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit the first motion directly at issue in this case.  This motion asked the court to vacate its judgment and remand to the District Court for additional proceedings in light of this Courts decision in Martinez v. Ryan, 

566 U.S. 1 (2012)
.
				[
					2
				]
				  The Ninth Circuit denied respondents motion on July 27, 2012.  Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari.  This Court denied the petition on October 9, 2012, 568 U.S. ___, and denied a petition for rehearing on January 7, 2013.  568 U.S. ___.
			

				
				
				Respondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and filed a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light of a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the interaction between Pinholster and Martinez.  The Ninth Circuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, de- clin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that would unduly interfere with Arizonas execution process.  Order in No. 0799005, Doc. 102, p.1.  But instead of issuing the mandate, the court decided suasponte to construe respondents motion as a motion to reconsider our prior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Remand in light of Martinez, which the court had denied on July 27, 2012.  Id., at2.  The court ordered briefing and, in a divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether respondent could establish that he received ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un- der Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice as a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel had merit.  No. 0799005 (Feb. 26, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. A13 to A15, 2013 WL 791610, *6.  Judge Graber dissented based on her conclusion that respondent could not show prejudice.  Id., at A16 to A17, 2013 WL 791610, *7.  Arizona set an execution date of March 6, 2013, which prompted respondent to file a motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013.  The Ninth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013, with Judge Graber again noting her dissent.
			

				
				
				On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit.  The court denied the petition the same day, with eight judges dissenting in two separate opinions.  709 F.3d 855 (2013).
			

				
				
				On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the stay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for certiorari.  This Court denied the application, with Jus- tices Scalia and Alito noting that they would grant it.  568 U.S. ___ (2013).  We now consider the petition.
			

				II
			

				
				
				Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets forth the default rule that [t]he court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.  (Emphasis added.)  The reason for this Rule is straightforward: [T]he stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio- rari.  Bell, 545 U.S., at 806.  Hence, once this Court has denied a petition, there is generally no need for further action from the lower courts.  See ibid. ([A] decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the end of litigation).  In Bell, Tennessee argued that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have issued on the date the Court of Appeals received notice of the Supreme Courts denial of certiorari.  Id., at 803.  There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell because we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of the mandate after denial of certiorari.  Id., at 803804.  As in Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.
			

				
				
				Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are reviewed in federal habeas proceedings, finality and comity concerns, based in principles of federalism, demand that federal courts accord the appropriate level of respect to state judgments by allowing them to be enforced when federal proceedings conclude.  Id., at 812813. As we noted, States have an interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.  Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v. Thompson, 

523 U.S. 538, 
555 (1998)
, in turn quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 

507 U.S. 619, 
635 (1993)
).  Elsewhere, we explained that the profound interests in repose attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals dictate that the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.  Calderon, supra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure 3938, p. 712 (2d ed. 1996)).  Deviation from normal mandate procedures is a power of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave, unforeseen contingencies.  Calderon, supra, at 550.  Even assuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it abuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate once the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless extraordinary circumstances justify that action.
			

				
				
				Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordinary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of justice.  There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel had been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial.  545 U.S., at 797.  On federal habeas review, he made the same argument.  Id., at 798.  After the Sixth Circuit affirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that placed substantial emphasis on his argument that the Sixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.  Id., at 800.  While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it stayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant sought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of the writ.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the Sixth Circuit did not issue its mandate.  Instead, the Sixth Circuit waited five months (and until two days before the scheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va- cated the District Courts denial of habeas and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claim.  Id., at 800801.  This Court reversed that decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate without notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously rejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federalism principles.
			

				
				
				In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its discretion when it did not issue the mandate.  As in Bell, the Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate based on an argument it had considered and rejected months earlier.  And, by the time of the Ninth Circuits February 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had been over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly 7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.

				Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented in the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to those accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following February.  Respondent styled his July 10 motion a Motion to Vacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for Additional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.  No. 0799005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p.1.  As its title suggests, the only claim presented in that motion was that respondents postconviction counsel should have developed more evidence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  Here, as in Bell, respondents July 10 motion pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals. 545 U.S., at 806.  These ar- guments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion that [i]t is difficult to see how ... counsel could have been clearer.  Id., at 808.  The Ninth Circuit had a full opportunity to consider these arguments but declined to do so, id., at 806, which support[s] our determination that the decision to withhold the mandate was in error.  Id., at 806807.  We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully considers each motion a capital defendant presents on habeas review.  See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of a petition for rehearing).  As a result, there is no indication that there were any extraordinary circumstances here that called for the court to revisit an argument suasponte that it already explicitly rejected.
			

				
				
				Finally, this case presents an additional issue not present in Bell.  In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth Circuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393 F.3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which precedes our Bell decision by more than six months, asserts the Ninth Circuits inherent authority to withhold a mandate.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A3 to A4, 2013 WL 791610, *1.  But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Circuits decision in Bell, which we reversed.  See Beardslee, supra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F.3d 688, 691692 (2004)).  That opinion, thus, provides no support for the Ninth Circuits decision.
			

				
				
				In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion when it neglected to issue its mandate.  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The Ninth Circuits judgment is reversed, the stay of execution is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to issue the mandate immediately and without any further proceedings.
			

				It is so ordered.

			Based on the 1978 strangling death of a 74-year-old, Schad was convicted in 1985 of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After extensive Arizona state and federal court proceedings, the Supreme Court denied petitions for certiorari and for rehearing. Schad immediately moved for a stay pending the Ninth Circuits decision in a separate en banc case The Ninth Circuit denied the motion, stating that an indefinite stay would unduly interfere with Arizonas execution process, but also declined to issue its mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The court instead, sua sponte, construed Schads motion as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier and remanded to the district court. Arizona then set an execution date. Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the Ninth Circuit issued a stay a few days before Schads scheduled execution. The Supreme Court granted Arizonas petition to vacate the stay and remanded with instructions to issue the mandate immediately, without any further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its mandate; its failure to issue its mandate constituted an abuse of discretion.

				No. 12142.Argued March 19, 2013Decided June 24, 2013
			

				The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires manufacturers to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before marketing any brand-name or generic drug in interstate commerce.  

21 U.S.C. 355(a).  Once a drug is approved, a manufacturer is prohibited from making any major changes to the qualitative or quantitative formulation of the drug product, including active ingredients, or in the specifications provided in the approved application.  21 CFR 314.70(b)(2)(i).  Generic manufacturers are also prohibited from making any unilateral changes to a drugs label.  See 314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10).
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2004, respondent was prescribed Clinoril, the brand-name version of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac, for shoulder pain.  Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of sulindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical.  Respondent soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.  She is now severely disfigured, has physical disabilities, and is nearly blind.  At the time of the prescription, sulindacs label did not specifically refer to toxic epidermal necrolysis.  By 2005, however, the FDA had recommended changing all NSAID labeling to contain a more explicit toxic epidermal necrolysis warning.  Respondent sued Mutual in New Hampshire state court, and Mutual removed the case to federal court.  A jury found Mutual liable on respondents design-defect claim and awarded her over $21 million.  The First Circuit affirmed.  As relevant, it found that neither the FDCA nor the FDAs regulations pre-empted respondents design-defect claim.  It distinguished PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S. ___in which the Court held that failure-to-warn claims against generic manufacturers are pre-empted by the FDCAs prohibition on changes to generic drug labelsby arguing that generic manufacturers facing design-defect claims could comply with both federal and state law simply by choosing not to make the drug at all.
			

				Held:State-law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a drugs warnings are pre-empted by federal law under PLIVA.  Pp.620.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.  Maryland v. Louisiana, 

451 U.S. 725
.  Even in the absence of an express pre-emption provision, a state law may be impliedly pre-empted where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.  English v. General Elec. Co., 

496 U.S. 72
.  Here, it is impossible for Mutual to comply with both its federal-law duty not to alter sulindacs label or composition and its state-law duty to either strengthen the warnings on sulindacs label or change sulindacs design.  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)New Hampshires design-defect cause of action imposes affirmative duties on manufacturers, including a duty to design [their products] reasonably safely for the uses which [they] can foresee.

				(2)To assess whether a products design is unreasonably dangerous to the user, Vautour v. Body Masters Sports Industries, Inc., 147 N.H. 150, 153, 784 A.2d 1178, 1181, the New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a risk-utility approach, which asks whether the dangers magnitude outweighs the products utility, id., at 154, 784 A.2d, at 1182.  The court has repeatedly identified three factors as germane to that inquiry: the usefulness and desirability of the product to the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could have been reduced without significantly affecting either the products effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.  Ibid.  Increasing a drugs usefulness or reducing its risk of danger would require redesigning the drug, since those factors are direct results of a drugs chemical design and active ingredients.  Here, however, redesign was not possible for two reasons.  First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as its brand-name drug equivalent.  Second, because of sulindacs simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.  Accordingly, because redesign was impossible, Mutual could only ameliorate sulindacs risk-utility profile by strengthening its warnings.  Thus, New Hampshires law ultimately required Mutual to change sulindacs labeling.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)But PLIVA makes clear that federal law prevents generic drug manufacturers from changing their labels.  See 564 U.S., at ___.  Accordingly, Mutual was prohibited from taking the remedial action required to avoid liability under New Hampshire law.  P.13.
			

				
				
				
				
				(4)When federal law forbids an action required by state law, the state law is without effect.  Maryland, supra, at 746.  Because it was impossible for Mutual to comply with both state and federal law, New Hampshires warning-based design-defect cause of action is pre-empted with respect to FDA-approved drugs sold in interstate commerce.  Pp.1314.
			

				
				
				(b)The First Circuits rationalethat Mutual could escape the impossibility of complying with both its federal- and state-law duties by choosing to stop selling sulindacis incompatible with this Courts pre-emption cases, which have presumed that an actor seeking to satisfy both federal- and state-law obligations is not required to cease acting altogether.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 12418.Argued April 17, 2013Decided June 24, 2013
			

				Respondent Kebodeaux was convicted by a special court-martial of a federal sex offense.  After serving his sentence and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, he moved to Texas where he registered with state authorities as a sex offender.  Congress subsequently enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live, study, and work, 

42 U.S.C. 16913(a), and which applies to offenders who, when SORNA became law, had already completed their sentences, 28 CFR 72.3.  When Kebodeaux moved within Texas and failed to update his registration, the Federal Government prosecuted him under SORNA, and the District Court convicted him.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that, at the time of SORNAs enactment, Kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no longer in any special relationship with the Federal Government.  Believing that Kebodeaux was not required to register under the pre-SORNA Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, the court found that he had been unconditionally freed.  That being so, the court held, the Federal Government lacked the power under Article Is Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate his intrastate movements.
			

				Held:SORNAs registration requirements as applied to Kebodeaux fall within the scope of Congress authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Pp.312.
			

				
				
				(a)Contrary to the Fifth Circuits critical assumption that Kebodeauxs release was unconditional, a full reading of the relevant statutes and regulations makes clear that at the time of his offense and conviction he was subject to the Wetterling Act, which imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to SORNAs.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 14072(i)(3)(4).  The fact that these federal-law requirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements made them no less requirements of federal law.  See generally United States v. Sharpnack, 

355 U.S. 286
294.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)Congress promulgated the Wetterling Act under authority granted by the Military Regulation Clause, Art.I, 8, cl. 14, and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  The same power that authorized Congress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish Kebodeauxs crime also authorized Congress to make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.  And its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently reasonable.  See Smith v. Doe, 

538 U.S. 84
103.  It was also entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special role to the Federal Government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offender registration requirements.  See Carr v. United States, 

560 U.S. 438
, ___.  Thus, Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who had, prior to its enactment, been unconditionally released, but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements enacted pursuant to the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses.  SORNA somewhat modified the applicable registration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, in order to make more uniform what had remained a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration requirements, Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.S. ___, ___.  No one here claims that these changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have found them necessary and proper means for furthering its pre-existing registration ends.

Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who was, before its enactment, unconditionally released, but to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements. SORNA somewhat modified registration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, to make more uniform ""a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration requirements."" At the time of his offense and conviction, Kebodeaux was subject to the Wetterling Act, which imposed similar registration requirements and was promulgated under the Military Regulation Clause (Art. I, s. 8, cl. 14), and the Necessary and Proper Clause. The same power that authorized Congress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish Kebodeauxs crime also authorized Congress to make the civil registration requirement at issue a consequence of conviction. Imposing a civil registration requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently reasonable, as is assignment of a special role to the federal government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offender registration requirements.

				UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER v. NASSAR
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 12484.Argued April 24, 2013Decided June 24, 2013
			

				Petitioner, a university medical center (University) that is part of the University of Texas system, specializes in medical education.  It has an affiliation agreement with Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospital), which requires the Hospital to offer vacant staff physician posts to University faculty members.  Respondent, a physician of Middle Eastern descent who was both a University faculty member and a Hospital staff physician, claimed that Dr. Levine, one of his supervisors at the University, was biased against him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage.  He complained to Dr. Fitz, Levines supervisor.  But after he arranged to continue working at the Hospital without also being on the Universitys faculty, he resigned his teaching post and sent a letter to Fitz and others, stating that he was leaving because of Levines harassment.  Fitz, upset at Levines public humiliation and wanting public exoneration for her, objected to the Hospitals job offer, which was then withdrawn.  Respondent filed suit, alleging two discrete Title VII violations.  First, he alleged that Levines racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted in his constructive discharge from the University, in violation of 

42 U.S.C. 2000e2(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee because of such individuals race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (referred to here as status-based discrimination).  Second, he claimed that Fitzs efforts to prevent the Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Levines harassment, in violation of 2000e3(a), which prohibits employer retaliation because [an employee] has opposed ... an unlawful employment practice ... or ... made a [Title VII] charge.  The jury found for respondent on both claims.  The Fifth Circuit vacated as to the constructive-discharge claim, but affirmed as to the retaliation finding on the theory that retaliation claims brought under 2000e3(a)like 2000e2(a) status-based claimsrequire only a showing that retaliation was a motivating factor for the adverse employment action, not its but-for cause, see 2000e2(m).  And it found that the evidence supported a finding that Fitz was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for his complaints about Levine.  
			

				Held:Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in 2000e2(m).  Pp.523.
			

				
				
				(a)In defining the proper causation standard for Title VII retaliation claims, it is presumed that Congress incorporated tort laws causation in fact standardi.e., proof that the defendants conduct did in fact cause the plaintiffs injuryabsent an indication to the contrary in the statute itself.  See Meyer v. Holley, 

537 U.S. 280
.  An employee alleging status-based discrimination under 2000e2 need not show but-for causation.  It suffices instead to show that the motive to discriminate was one of the employers motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives for the decision.  This principle is the result of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 

490 U.S. 228
, and the ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which substituted a new burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.  As relevant here, that Act added a new subsection to 2000e2, providing that an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice, 2000e2(m).  
			

				
				
				Also relevant here is this Courts decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 

557 U.S. 167
, which interprets the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) phrase because of ... age, 

29 U.S.C. 623(a)(1).  Gross holds two insights that inform the analysis of this case.  The first is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of the term because as it relates to the principles of causation underlying both 623(a) and 2000e3(a).  The second is the significance of Congress structural choices in both Title VII itself and the 1991 Act.  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				(b)Title VIIs antiretaliation provision appears in a different section from its status-based discrimination ban.  And, like 623(a)(1), the ADEA provision in Gross, 2000e3(a) makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse employment action against an employee because of certain criteria.  Given the lack of any meaningful textual difference between 2000e3(a) and 623(a)(1), the proper conclusion is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action.  Respondent and the United States maintain that 2000e2(m)s motivating-factor test applies, but that reading is flawed.  First, it is inconsistent with the provisions plain language, which addresses only race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination and says nothing about retaliation.  Second, their reading is inconsistent with the statutes design and structure.  Congress inserted the motivating-factor provision as a subsection within 2000e2, which deals only with status-based discrimination.  The conclusion that Congress acted deliberately in omitting retaliation claims from 20002(m) is reinforced by the fact that another part of the 1991 Act, 109, expressly refers to all unlawful employment actions.  See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 

499 U.S. 244
.  Third, the cases they rely on, which state the general proposition that Congress enactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrimination, see, e.g., CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 

553 U.S. 442
453; Gmez-Prez v. Potter, 

553 U.S. 474
, do not support the quite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a synonym for retaliation, especially in a precise, complex, and exhaustive statute like Title VII.  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which contains seven paragraphs of detailed description of the practices constituting prohibited discrimination, as well as an express antiretaliation provision, and which was passed only a year before 2000e2(m)s enactment, shows that when Congress elected to address retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so clearly.  Pp.1117.
			

				
				
				(c)The proper interpretation and implementation of 2000e3(a) and its causation standard are of central importance to the fair and responsible allocation of resources in the judicial and litigation systems, particularly since retaliation claims are being made with ever-increasing frequency.  Lessening the causation standard could also contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, siphoning resources from efforts by employers, agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.  Pp.1820.
			

				
				
				(d)Respondent and the Government argue that their view would be consistent with longstanding agency views contained in an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance manual, but the manuals explanations for its views lack the persuasive force that is a necessary precondition to deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 

323 U.S. 134
.  Respondents final argumentthat if 2000e2(m) does not control, then the Price Waterhouse standard shouldis foreclosed by the 1991 Acts amendments to Title VII, which displaced the Price Waterhouse framework.  Pp.2023.
			

				674 F.3d 448, vacated and remanded.

				DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 119540.Argued January 7, 2013Decided June 20, 2013
			

				The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) increases the sentences of certain federal defendants who have three prior convictions for a violent felony, including burglary, arson, or extortion.  

18 U.S.C. 924(e).  To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those crimes, courts use a categorical approach: They compare the statutory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the generic crimei.e., the offense as commonly understood.  If the statutes elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense, the prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate.  When a prior conviction is for violating a divisible statuteone that sets out one or more of the elements in the alternative, e.g., burglary involving entry into a building or an automobilea modified categorical approach is used.  That approach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the defendants prior conviction.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  The Government sought an ACCA sentence enhancement, pointing to Descamps three prior convictions, including one for burglary under California Penal Code Ann. 459, which provides that a person who enters certain locations with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.  In imposing an enhanced sentence, the District Court rejected Descamps argument that his 459 conviction cannot serve as an ACCA predicate because 459 goes beyond the generic definition of burglary.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F.3d 915, permits the application of the modified categorical approach to a prior conviction under a statute that is categorically broader than the generic offense.  It found that Descamps 459 conviction, as revealed in the plea colloquy, rested on facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary.
			

				Held:The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes like 459 that contain a single, indivisible set of elements.  Pp.523.
			

				
				
				(a)This Courts caselaw all but resolves this case.  In Taylor v. United States, 

495 U.S. 575
, and Shepard v. United States, 

544 U.S. 13
, the Court approved the use of a modified categorical approach in a narrow range of cases in which a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element played a part in the defendants conviction.  Because a sentencing court cannot tell, simply by looking at a divisible statute, which version of the offense a defendant was convicted of, the court is permitted to consult extra-statutory documentsbut only to assess whether the defendant was convicted of the particular statutory definition that corresponds to the generic offense.  Nijhawan v. Holder, 

557 U.S. 29
, and Johnson v. United States, 

559 U.S. 133
, also emphasized this elements-based rationale for the modified categorical approach.  That approach plays no role here, where the dispute does not concern alternative elements but a simple discrepancy between generic burglary and 459.  Pp.510.
			

				
				
				(b)The Ninth Circuits Aguila-Montes approach turns an elements-based inquiry into an evidence-based one, asking not whether statutory definitions necessarily require an adjudicator to find the generic offense, but whether the prosecutors case realistically led the adjudicator to find certain facts.  Aguila-Montes has no roots in this Courts precedents.  In fact, it subverts those decisions, conflicting with each of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening to undo all its benefits.  Pp.1019.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Taylors elements-centric categorical approach comports with ACCAs text and history, avoids 
 
Sixth Amendment concerns that would arise from sentencing courts making factual findings that properly belong to juries, and averts the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach.  495 U.S., at 601.
			

				
				
				ACCAs language shows that Congress intended sentencing courts to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.  Id., at 600.  The Ninth Circuits approach runs headlong into that congressional choice.  Instead of reviewing extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative element was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.
			

				
				
				Under ACCA, the sentencing courts finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases the maximum penalty.  Accordingly, that finding would (at least) raise serious 
 
Sixth Amendment concerns if it went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction.  That is why Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed determination about what facts must have supported a defendants conviction.  544 U.S., at 25 (plurality opinion).  Yet the Ninth Circuit flouts this Courts reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.
				
				
			

				
				
				The Ninth Circuits decision also creates the same daunting difficulties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the categorical approach.  Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element of the relevant generic offense.  And the Aguila-Montes approach would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea deals.  Pp.1216.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)In defending Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit denied any  real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending further than the generic offense.  But the Circuits efforts to imaginatively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavailing.  Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every element of the generic crime.  Pp.1619.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government offers a slightly different argument: It contends that the modified categorical approach should apply where, as here, the mismatch of elements between the crime of conviction and the generic offense results not from a missing element but from an elements overbreadth.  But that distinction is malleable and manipulable.  And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element, the problem is the same:  Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the generic crime.  Pp.1922.
			

				
				
				(d)Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alternative element of, 459, a conviction under that statute is never for generic burglary.  Descamps ACCA enhancement was therefore improper.  Pp.2223.
			

				466 Fed. Appx. 563, reversed.

Instead of reviewing extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative element was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.
			

				
				
				Under ACCA, the sentencing courts finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases the maximum penalty.  Accordingly, that finding would (at least) raise serious 
 
Sixth Amendment concerns if it went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction.  That is why Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed determination about what facts must have supported a defendants conviction.  544 U.S., at 25 (plurality opinion).  Yet the Ninth Circuit flouts this Courts reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.
				
				
			

				
				
				The Ninth Circuits decision also creates the same daunting difficulties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the categorical approach.  Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element of the relevant generic offense.  And the Aguila-Montes approach would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea deals.  Pp.1216.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)In defending Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit denied any  real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending further than the generic offense.  But the Circuits efforts to imaginatively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavailing.  Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every element of the generic crime.  Pp.1619.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government offers a slightly different argument: It contends that the modified categorical approach should apply where, as here, the mismatch of elements between the crime of conviction and the generic offense results not from a missing element but from an elements overbreadth.  But that distinction is malleable and manipulable.  And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element, the problem is the same:  Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the generic crime.  Pp.1922.
			

				
				
				(d)Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alternative element of, 459, a conviction under that statute is never for generic burglary.  Descamps ACCA enhancement was therefore improper.  Pp.2223.
			

				466 Fed. Appx. 563, reversed.
			

				
				
				Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion.
			"|"
			The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) increases the sentences of federal defendants who have three prior convictions for a violent felony, including burglary, arson, or extortion, 18 U.S.C. 924(e). Under the categorical approach courts compare the statutory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the generic crime, the offense as commonly understood. If the statutory elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense, a prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. A modified categorical approach is employed when a prior conviction is for violating a divisible statute that sets out one or more elements in the alternative, such as burglary involving entry into a building or an automobile. That approach permits the court to consult certain documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative element was the basis of the prior conviction. Descamps, convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, had three prior convictions, including one under a California statute, which provides that a person who enters certain locations with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary. The district court concluded that the conviction could serve as an ACCA predicate. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed.  Instead of reviewing extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative element was the basis for the conviction, the Ninth Circuit examined those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.  Generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alternative element of, the California law, so a conviction under that statute is never for generic burglary and ACCA enhancement was improper.  The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes that contain a single, indivisible set of elements. An elements-centric categorical approach is consistent with ACCAs text and history, avoids Sixth Amendment concerns arising from sentencing courts making factual findings that properly belong to juries, and averts the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach.

				Syllabus
			

				AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT etal. v. ALLIANCE FOR OPEN SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL, INC., etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 1210.Argued April 22, 2013Decided June 20, 2013
			

				In the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act), 

22 U.S.C. 7601 etseq., Congress has authorized the appropriation of billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide.  The Act imposes two related conditions: (1) No funds may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution, 7631(e); and (2) no funds may be used by an organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution, 7631(f).  To enforce the second condition, known as the Policy Requirement, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) require funding recipients to agree in their award documents that they oppose prostitution.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondents, recipients of Leadership Act funds who wish to remain neutral on prostitution, sought a declaratory judgment that the Policy Requirement violates their 
 
First Amendment rights.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction, barring the Government from cutting off respondents Leadership Act funding during the litigation or from otherwise taking action based on their privately funded speech.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Policy Requirement, as implemented by the agencies, violated respondents freedom of speech.  
			

				Held:The Policy Requirement violates the 
 
First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.  Pp.615.
			

				
				
				(a)The Policy Requirement mandates that recipients of federal funds explicitly agree with the Governments policy to oppose prostitution.  The 
 
First Amendment, however, prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 

547 U.S. 47
.  As a direct regulation, the Policy Requirement would plainly violate the 
 
First Amendment.  The question is whether the Government may nonetheless impose that requirement as a condition of federal funding.  Pp.67.
			

				
				
				(b)The Spending Clause grants Congress broad discretion to fund private programs or activities for the general Welfare, Art.I, 8, cl.1, including authority to impose limits on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.  Rust v. Sullivan, 

500 U.S. 173
, n.4.  As a general matter, if a party objects to those limits, its recourse is to decline the funds.  In some cases, however, a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on 
 
First Amendment rights.  The distinction that has emerged from this Courts cases is between conditions that define the limits of the Government spending programthose that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidizeand conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the federal program itself.  
			

				
				
				Rust illustrates the distinction.  In that case, the Court considered Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which authorized grants to health-care organizations offering family planning services, but prohibited federal funds from being used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.  500 U.S., at 178.  To enforce the provision, HHS regulations barred Title X projects from advocating abortion and required grantees to keep their Title X projects separate from their other projects.  The regulations were valid, the Court explained, because they governed only the scope of the grantees Title X projects, leaving the grantee free to engage in abortion advocacy through programs that were independent from its Title X projects.  Because the regulations did not prohibit speech outside the scope of the federally funded program, they did not run afoul of the 
 
First Amendment.  Id., at 197.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				(c)The distinction between conditions that define a federal program and those that reach outside it is not always self-evident, but the Court is confident that the Policy Requirement falls on the unconstitutional side of the line.  To begin, the Leadership Acts other funding condition, which prohibits Leadership Act funds from being used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking, 7631(e), ensures that federal funds will not be used for prohibited purposes.  The Policy Requirement thus must be doing something moreand it is.  By demanding that funding recipients adopt and espouse, as their own, the Governments view on an issue of public concern, the Policy Requirement by its very nature affects protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.  Rust, supra, at 197.  A recipient cannot avow the belief dictated by the condition when spending Leadership Act funds, and assert a contrary belief when participating in activities on its own time and dime. 
			

				
				
				The Government suggests that if funding recipients could promote or condone prostitution using private funds, it would undermine the governments program and confuse its message opposing prostitution.  Brief for Petitioners 37.  But the Policy Requirement goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program.  It requires them to pledge allegiance to the Governments policy of eradicating prostitution.  That condition on funding violates the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp.1115.
			

				651 F.3d 218, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 12133.Argued February 27, 2013Decided June 20, 2013
			

				An agreement between petitioners, American Express and a subsidiary, and respondents, merchants who accept American Express cards, requires all of their disputes to be resolved by arbitration and provides that there shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.  Respondents nonetheless filed a class action, claiming that petitioners violated 1 of the Sherman Act and seeking treble damages for the class under 4 of the Clayton Act.  Petitioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), but respondents countered that the cost of expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would greatly exceed the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff.  The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits.  The Second Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that because of the prohibitive costs respondents would face if they had to arbitrate, the class-action waiver was unenforceable and arbitration could not proceed.  The Circuit stood by its reversal when this Court remanded in light of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 

559 U.S. 662
, which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to class arbitration absent an agreement to do so.  
			

				Held:The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiffs cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery.  Pp.310.
			

				
				
				(a)The FAA reflects the overarching principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.  See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. ___, ___.  Courts must rigorously enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,

				(b)No contrary congressional command requires rejection of the class-arbitration waiver here.  The antitrust laws do not guarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim, see Rodriguez v. United States,

473 U.S. 614
.  Nor does congressional approval of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 establish an entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of statutory rights.  The Rule imposes stringent requirements for certification that exclude most claims, and this Court has rejected the assertion that the class-notice requirement must be dispensed with because the prohibitively high cost of compliance would frustrate [plaintiffs] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the antitrust laws, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 

417 U.S. 156

				ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
			

				No. 119335.Argued January 14, 2013Decided June 17, 2013
			

				Petitioner Alleyne was charged, as relevant here, with using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 

18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, 924(c)(1)(A)(i), that increases to a 7-year minimum if the firearm is brandished, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum if the firearm is discharged, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).  In convicting Alleyne, the jury form indicated that he had [u]sed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, but not that the firearm was [b]randished.  When the presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence on the 924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the verdict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing beyond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum sentence based on a sentencing judges finding of brandishing would violate his 
 
Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.  The District Court overruled his objection, relying on this Courts holding in Harris v. United States, 

536 U.S. 545
, that judicial factfinding that increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible under the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that Alleynes objection was foreclosed by Harris.

				1.Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element that must be submitted to the jury.  Accordingly, Harris is overruled.  Pp.1016.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Apprendi v. New Jersey, 

530 U.S. 466
, concluded that any facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime, id., at 490, and thus the 
 
Sixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 484.  Apprendis principle applies with equal force to facts increasing the mandatory minimum, for a fact triggering a mandatory minimum alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.  Id., at 490.  Because the legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.  It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime.  The fact that criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.  It is also impossible to dispute that the facts increasing the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment, heightening the loss of liberty associated with the crime.  Defining facts that increase a mandatory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment, see id., at 478479, and preserves the jurys historic role as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants, see United States v. Gaudin, 

515 U.S. 506
511.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the fact that the 7-year minimum sentence could have been imposed with or without a judicial finding of brandishing, because the jurys finding authorized a sentence of five years to life, 536 U.S., at 561, but that fact is beside the point.  The essential 
 
Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is an element of the crime.  Because the fact of brandishing aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received had a different range been applicable.  There is no basis in principle or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that increase the minimum.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)This ruling does not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury.  This Court has long recognized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not violate the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  See, e.g., Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.1516.
			

				
				
				2.Here, the sentencing range supported by the jurys verdict was five years imprisonment to life, but the judge, rather than the jury, found brandishing.  This increased the penalty to which Alleyne was subjected and violated his 
 
Sixth Amendment rights.  Pp.1617.
			

				
				
				Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan, concluded in Parts II and IIIA:
			

				
				
				1.The 
 
Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Gaudin, 515 U.S., at 510.  Several divided opinions of this Court have addressed the constitutional status of a sentencing factor.  In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 

477 U.S. 79
, the Court held that facts found to increase a mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors that a judge could find by a preponderance of the evidence.  In Apprendi, however, the Court declined to extend McMillan to a New Jersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment if the trial judge found that the crime was committed with racial bias, 530 U.S., at 470, finding that any fact that increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an element of the offense to be found by the jury.  Id., at 483, n.10, 490.  Two years later in Harris, the Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence.  536 U.S., at 557.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				2.The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an element of the charged offense.  United States v. OBrien, 

560 U.S. 218
, ___.  Apprendis definition necessarily includes not only facts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor.  At common law, the relationship between crime and punishment was clear.  A sentence was prescribed for each offense, leaving judges with little sentencing discretion.  If a fact was by law essential to the penalty, it was an element of the offense.  There was a well-established practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to the jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing punishment.  And this understanding was reflected in contemporaneous court decisions and treatises.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				Justice Breyer, agreeing that Harris v. United States, 

536 U.S. 545
, should be overruled, concluded that he continues to disagree with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 

530 U.S. 466
, because it fails to recognize the laws traditional distinction between elements of a crime and sentencing facts, but finds it highly anomalous to read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence.  Overruling Harris and applying Apprendis basic jury-determination rule to mandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly.  Where a maximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to impose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.  Where a mandatory minimum sentence is at issue, Apprendi would mean that the government cannot force a judge who does not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.  Pp.13.

				ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
			

				No. 119335.Argued January 14, 2013Decided June 17, 2013
			

				Petitioner Alleyne was charged, as relevant here, with using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 

18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, 924(c)(1)(A)(i), that increases to a 7-year minimum if the firearm is brandished, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum if the firearm is discharged, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).  In convicting Alleyne, the jury form indicated that he had [u]sed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, but not that the firearm was [b]randished.  When the presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence on the 924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the verdict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing beyond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum sentence based on a sentencing judges finding of brandishing would violate his 
 
Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.  The District Court overruled his objection, relying on this Courts holding in Harris v. United States, 

536 U.S. 545
, that judicial factfinding that increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible under the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that Alleynes objection was foreclosed by Harris.

			Alleyne was convicted using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence. The sentences increases to a seven-year minimum if the firearm is brandished, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum if it is discharged, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii). The jury form indicated that Alleyne had [u]sed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, but not that the firearm was [b]randished. Alleyne objected to a sentencing report recommendation of a seven-year term, arguing that the jury did not find brandishing beyond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum sentence based on a judges finding of brandishing would violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.

				GENOVEVO SALINAS, PETITIONER v. TEXAS
			

				on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas
			

				[June 17, 2013]
			



				
				
				Justice Alito announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.
			

				
				
				Without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warnings, petitioner voluntarily answered the questions of a police officer who was investigating a murder.  But petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioners shotgun.  Petitioner was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officers question suggested that he was guilty.  Petitioner claims that this argument violated the 
 
Fifth Amendment, which guarantees that [n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
			

				
				
				Petitioners 
 
Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in response to the officers question.  It has long been settled that the privilege generally is not self-executing and that a witness who desires its protection must claim it.  Minnesota v. Murphy, 

465 U.S. 420, 
425, 
427 (1984)
 (quoting United States v. Monia, 

317 U.S. 424, 
427 (1943)
).  Although no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege, Quinn v. United States, 

349 U.S. 155, 
164 (1955)
, a witness does not do so by simply standing mute.  Because petitioner was required to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting petitioners 
 
Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.
			

				I
			

				
				
				On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers were shot and killed in their Houston home.  There were no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a dark-colored car.  Police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene.  The investigation led police to petitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed.  Police visited petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway.  He agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.
			

				
				
				Petitioners interview with the police lasted approximately one hour.  All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read Miranda warnings.  See Mi- randa v. Arizona, 

384 U.S. 436 (1966)
.  For most of the interview, petitioner answered the officers questions.  But when asked whether his shotgun would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder, App. 17, petitioner declined to answer.  Instead, petitioner [l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.  Id., at  18.  After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants.  Prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders, and he was released.  A few days later, police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings.  On the strength of that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti- tioner, but by this time he had absconded.  In 2007, police discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an assumed name.
			

				
				
				Petitioner did not testify at trial.  Over his objection, prosecutors used his reaction to the officers question dur- ing the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt.  The jury found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence.  On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioners prearrest, pre-Miranda silence was not compelled within the meaning of the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  368 S.W.3d 550, 557559 (2011).  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and affirmed on the same ground.  369 S.W. 3d 176 (2012).
			

				
				
				We granted certiorari, 568 U.S. ___ (2013), to resolve a division of authority in the lower courts over whether the prosecution may use a defendants assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial police interview as part of its case in chief.  Compare, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 944 F.2d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991), with United States v. Moore, 104 F.3d 377, 386 (CADC 1997).  But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege during his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that question.
			

				II
			

				A
			

				
				
				The privilege against self-incrimination is an exception to the general principle that the Government has the right to everyones testimony.  Garner v. United States, 

424 U.S. 648
, n.11 (1976).  To prevent the privilege from shielding information not properly within its scope, we have long held that a witness who desires the protection of the privilege ... must claim it at the time he relies on it.  Murphy, 465 U.S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U.S., at 427).  See also United States exrel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 

273 U.S. 103, 
113 (1927)
.
			

				
				
				That requirement ensures that the Government is put on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United States, 

341 U.S. 479, 
486 (1951)
, or cure any potential self-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kastigar v. United States, 

406 U.S. 441, 
448 (1972)
.  The express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with evaluating a 
 
Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous record establishing the witness reasons for refusing to answer.  See Roberts v. United States, 

445 U.S. 552
, n.7 (1980) (A witness may not employ the privilege to avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not to give); Hutcheson v. United States, 

369 U.S. 599
611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as proper assertion of the privilege).  In these ways, insisting that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege assures that the Government obtains all the information to which it is entitled.  Garner, supra, at 658, n.11.
			

				
				
				We have previously recognized two exceptions to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but neither applies here.  First, we held in Griffin v. California, 

380 U.S. 609
615 (1965), that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.  That exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an absolute right not to testify.  Turner v. United States, 

396 U.S. 398, 
433 (1970)
 (Black, J., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, 

542 U.S. 630, 
637 (2004)
 (plurality opinion).  Since a defendants reasons for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke the privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing that his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a grant of immunity could force him to speak.  Because pe- titioner had no comparable unqualified right during his interview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin exception.
			

				
				
				Second, we have held that a witness failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.  Thus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected to the inherently compelling pressures of an unwarned custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege.  384 U.S., at 467468, and n.37.  Due to the uniquely coercive nature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody cannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege unless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.  Murphy, supra, at 429430.
			

				
				
				For similar reasons, we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it need not be affirmatively asserted.  Garrity v. New Jersey, 

385 U. S. 493, 
497 (1967)
 (public employment).  See also Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 

431 U. S. 801
804 (1977) (public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 

414 U.S. 70
85 (1973) (public contracts).  And where assertion of the privilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence.  See, e.g., Leary v. United States, 

395 U.S. 6
29 (1969) (no requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing so would have revealed income from illegal activities); Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 

382 U.S. 70
79 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not required to complete registration form where response to any of the forms questions ... might involve [them] in the admission of a crucial element of a crime).  The principle that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official compulsion denies him a free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.  Garner, 424 U.S., at 656657 (quoting Lisenba v. California, 

314 U.S. 219, 
241 (1941)
).
			

				
				
				Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary.  As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and was free to leave at any time during the interview.  Brief for Petitioner 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That places petitioners situation outside the scope of Miranda and other cases in which we have held that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege.  The dissent elides this point when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that [c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  Post, at 78 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The critical question is whether, under the circumstances of this case, petitioner was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  He was not.  We have before us no allegation that petitioners failure to assert the privilege was involuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to say that he was not answering the officers question on 
 
Fifth Amendment grounds.  Because he failed to do so, the prosecutions use of his noncustodial silence did not violate the 
 
Fifth Amendment.
			

				B
			

				
				
				Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in- vocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands mute and thereby declines to give an answer that of- ficials suspect would be incriminating.  Our cases all but foreclose such an exception, which would needlessly burden the Governments interests in obtaining testimony and prosecuting criminal activity.  We therefore decline petitioners invitation to craft a new exception to the general rule that a witness must assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.  Murphy, 465 U.S., at 429.
			

				
				
				Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.  In Roberts v. United States, 

445 U.S. 552
, for example, we rejected the 
 
Fifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained silent throughout a police investigation and received a harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate.  In so ruling, we explained that if [the defendant] believed that his failure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.  Id., at 560.  See also United States v. Sullivan, 

274 U.S. 259
264 (1927); Vajtauer, 273 U.S., at 113.
				[
					1
				]

				We have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incrim- inate the witness.

				Petitioner does not dispute the vitality of either of those lines of precedent but instead argues that we should adopt an exception for cases at their intersection.  Thus, petitioner would have us hold that although neither a wit- ness silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse the express invocation requirement, the invocation requirement does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of official suspicions.  For the same reasons that neither of those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we conclude that they do not do so together.  A contrary result would do little to protect those genuinely relying on the 
 
Fifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new burden on societys interest in the admission of evidence that is probative of a criminal defendants guilt.
			

				
				
				Petitioners proposed exception would also be very difficult to reconcile with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 

560 U.S. 370 (2010)
.  There, we held in the closely related context of post-Miranda silence that a defendant failed to invoke the privilege when he refused to respond to police questioning for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  560 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 3, 810).  If the extended custodial silence in that case did not invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary silence in this case did not do so either.
			

				
				
				Petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish Berg- huis by observing that it did not concern the admissi- bility of the defendants silence but instead involved the admissibility of his subsequent statements.  Post, at 89 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But regardless of whether prosecutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows, the logic of Berghuis applies with equal force: A suspect who stands mute has not done enough to put police on notice that he is relying on his 
 
Fifth Amendment privilege.

Fifth Amendment privilege is the most likely explanation for silence in a case such as this one.  Reply Brief 17; see post, at 910 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  But whatever the most probable explanation, such silence is insolubly ambiguous.  See Doyle, v. Ohio, 

426 U.S. 610, 
617 (1976)
.  To be sure, someone might decline to answer a police officers question in reliance on his constitutional privilege.  But he also might do so because he is trying to think of a good lie, because he is embarrassed, or because he is protecting someone else.  Not every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but neither is every possible explanation protected by the

				GENOVEVO SALINAS, PETITIONER v. TEXAS
			

				on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas
			

				[June 17, 2013]
			



				
				
				Justice Alito announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.
			

				
				
				Without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warnings, petitioner voluntarily answered the questions of a police officer who was investigating a murder.  But petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioners shotgun.  Petitioner was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officers question suggested that he was guilty.  Petitioner claims that this argument violated the 
 
Fifth Amendment, which guarantees that [n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
			

				
				
				Petitioners 
 
Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in response to the officers question.  It has long been settled that the privilege generally is not self-executing and that a witness who desires its protection must claim it.  Minnesota v. Murphy, 

465 U.S. 420, 
425, 
427 (1984)
 (quoting United States v. Monia, 

317 U.S. 424, 
427 (1943)
).  Although no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege, Quinn v. United States, 

349 U.S. 155, 
164 (1955)
, a witness does not do so by simply standing mute.  Because petitioner was required to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting petitioners 
 
Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.
			

				I
			

				
				
				On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers were shot and killed in their Houston home.  There were no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a dark-colored car.  Police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene.  The investigation led police to petitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed.  Police visited petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway.  He agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.
			

				
				
				Petitioners interview with the police lasted approximately one hour.  All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read Miranda warnings.  See Mi- randa v. Arizona, 

384 U.S. 436 (1966)
.  For most of the interview, petitioner answered the officers questions.  But when asked whether his shotgun would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder, App. 17, petitioner declined to answer.  Instead, petitioner [l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.  Id., at  18.  After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants.  Prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders, and he was released.  A few days later, police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings.  On the strength of that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti- tioner, but by this time he had absconded.  In 2007, police discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an assumed name.
			

				
				
				Petitioner did not testify at trial.  Over his objection, prosecutors used his reaction to the officers question dur- ing the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt.  The jury found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence.  On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioners prearrest, pre-Miranda silence was not compelled within the meaning of the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  368 S.W.3d 550, 557559 (2011).  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and affirmed on the same ground.  369 S.W. 3d 176 (2012).
			

				
				
				We granted certiorari, 568 U.S. ___ (2013), to resolve a division of authority in the lower courts over whether the prosecution may use a defendants assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial police interview as part of its case in chief.  Compare, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 944 F.2d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991), with United States v. Moore, 104 F.3d 377, 386 (CADC 1997).  But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege during his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that question.
			

				II
			

				A
			

				
				
				The privilege against self-incrimination is an exception to the general principle that the Government has the right to everyones testimony.  Garner v. United States, 

424 U.S. 648
, n.11 (1976).  To prevent the privilege from shielding information not properly within its scope, we have long held that a witness who desires the protection of the privilege ... must claim it at the time he relies on it.  Murphy, 465 U.S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U.S., at 427).  See also United States exrel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 

273 U.S. 103, 
113 (1927)
.
			

				
				
				That requirement ensures that the Government is put on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United States, 

341 U.S. 479, 
486 (1951)
, or cure any potential self-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kastigar v. United States, 

406 U.S. 441, 
448 (1972)
.  The express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with evaluating a 
 
Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous record establishing the witness reasons for refusing to answer.  See Roberts v. United States, 

445 U.S. 552
, n.7 (1980) (A witness may not employ the privilege to avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not to give); Hutcheson v. United States, 

369 U.S. 599
611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as proper assertion of the privilege).  In these ways, insisting that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege assures that the Government obtains all the information to which it is entitled.  Garner, supra, at 658, n.11.
			

				
				
				We have previously recognized two exceptions to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but neither applies here.  First, we held in Griffin v. California, 

380 U.S. 609
615 (1965), that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.  That exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an absolute right not to testify.  Turner v. United States, 

396 U.S. 398, 
433 (1970)
 (Black, J., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, 

542 U.S. 630, 
637 (2004)
 (plurality opinion).  Since a defendants reasons for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke the privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing that his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a grant of immunity could force him to speak.  Because pe- titioner had no comparable unqualified right during his interview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin exception.
			

				
				
				Second, we have held that a witness failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.  Thus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected to the inherently compelling pressures of an unwarned custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege.  384 U.S., at 467468, and n.37.  Due to the uniquely coercive nature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody cannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege unless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.  Murphy, supra, at 429430.
			

				
				
				For similar reasons, we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it need not be affirmatively asserted.  Garrity v. New Jersey, 

385 U. S. 493, 
497 (1967)
 (public employment).  See also Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 

431 U. S. 801
804 (1977) (public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 

414 U.S. 70
85 (1973) (public contracts).  And where assertion of the privilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence.  See, e.g., Leary v. United States, 

395 U.S. 6
29 (1969) (no requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing so would have revealed income from illegal activities); Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 

382 U.S. 70
79 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not required to complete registration form where response to any of the forms questions ... might involve [them] in the admission of a crucial element of a crime).  The principle that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official compulsion denies him a free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.  Garner, 424 U.S., at 656657 (quoting Lisenba v. California, 

314 U.S. 219, 
241 (1941)
).
			

				
				
				Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary.  As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and was free to leave at any time during the interview.  Brief for Petitioner 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That places petitioners situation outside the scope of Miranda and other cases in which we have held that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege.  The dissent elides this point when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that [c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  Post, at 78 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The critical question is whether, under the circumstances of this case, petitioner was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  He was not.  We have before us no allegation that petitioners failure to assert the privilege was involuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to say that he was not answering the officers question on 
 
Fifth Amendment grounds.  Because he failed to do so, the prosecutions use of his noncustodial silence did not violate the 
 
Fifth Amendment.
			

				B
			

				
				
				Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in- vocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands mute and thereby declines to give an answer that of- ficials suspect would be incriminating.  Our cases all but foreclose such an exception, which would needlessly burden the Governments interests in obtaining testimony and prosecuting criminal activity.  We therefore decline petitioners invitation to craft a new exception to the general rule that a witness must assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.  Murphy, 465 U.S., at 429.
			

				
				
				Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.  In Roberts v. United States, 

445 U.S. 552
, for example, we rejected the 
 
Fifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained silent throughout a police investigation and received a harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate.  In so ruling, we explained that if [the defendant] believed that his failure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.  Id., at 560.  See also United States v. Sullivan, 

274 U.S. 259
264 (1927); Vajtauer, 273 U.S., at 113.

				We have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incrim- inate the witness.  Thus, in Murphy we held that the defendants self-incriminating answers to his probation of- ficer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to invoke the privilege.  465 U.S., at 427428.

			Without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warnings, the defendant voluntarily answered questions about a murder.

Using the personal information provided by the DMV, respondents sent over 34,000 car purchasers letters, which were headed ADVERTISING MATERIAL, explained the lawsuit, and asked recipients to return an enclosed reply card if they wanted to participate in the case.  Petitioners, South Carolina residents, sued respondents for violating the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA) by obtaining, disclosing, and using petitioners personal information from motor vehicle records for bulk solicitation without their express consent.  Respondents moved to dismiss, claiming that the information was properly released under a DPPA exception permitting disclosure of personal information for use in connection with any civil, criminal, administrative, or arbitral proceeding, including investigation in anticipation of litigation.  

18 U.S.C. 2721(b)(4).  The District Court held that respondents letters were not solicitations and that the use of information fell within (b)(4)s litigation exception.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the letters were solicitation, but that the solicitation was intertwined with conduct that satisfied the (b)(4) exception.
			

				Held:An attorneys solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered by the (b)(4) litigation exception.  Pp.629.
			

				
				
				(a)State DMVs generally require someone seeking a drivers license or registering a vehicle to disclose detailed personal information such as name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and medical information.  The DPPAresponding to a threat from stalkers and criminals who could acquire state DMV information, and concerns over the States common practice of selling such information to direct marketing and solicitation businessesbans disclosure, absent a drivers consent, of personal information, e.g., names, addresses, or telephone numbers, as well as highly restricted personal information, e.g., photographs, social security numbers, and medical or disability information, 2725(4), unless 1 of 14 exemptions applies.  Subsection (b)(4) permits disclosure of both personal information and highly restricted personal information, while subsection (b)(12) permits disclosure only of personal information.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				(b)Respondents solicitation of prospective clients is neither a use in connection with litigation nor investigation in anticipation of litigation under (b)(4).  Pp.815.

514 U.S. 645
.  Such a consistent interpretation is also required because (b)(4) is an exception to both the DPPAs general ban on disclosure of personal information and the ban on release of highly restricted personal information.  An exception to a general policy statement is usually read ... narrowly in order to preserve the [provisions] primary operation.  Commissioner v. Clark, 

489 U.S. 726
.  Reading (b)(4) to permit disclosure of personal information when there is any connection between protected information and a potential legal dispute would substantially undermine the DPPAs purpose of protecting a right to privacy in motor vehicle records.  Subsection (b)(4)s in connection with language must have a limit, and a logical and necessary conclusion is that an attorneys solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of that limit.  Pp.911.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)An attorneys solicitation of new clients is distinct from an attorneys conduct on behalf of his client or the court.  Solicitation by a lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction, Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 

436 U.S. 447
, and state bars treat solicitation as discrete professional conduct.  Excluding solicitation from the meaning of in connection with litigation draws support from (b)(4)s examples of permissible litigation usesservice of process, investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orderswhich all involve an attorneys conduct as an officer of the court, not a commercial actor.  Similarly, investigation in anticipation of litigation is best understood to allow background research to determine if there is a supportable theory for a complaint or a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing a frivolous lawsuit, or to help locate witnesses for deposition or trial.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)This reading is also supported by the fact that (b)(4) allows use of the most sensitive personal information.  Permitting its use in solicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it must not be assumed, without clear and explicit language, absent here, that Congress intended to exempt attorneys from DPPA liability in this regard.  Pp.1415.
			

				
				
				(c)Limiting (b)(4)s reach also respects the statutory purpose and design evident in subsection (b)(12), which allows solicitation only of persons who have given express consent to have their names and addresses disclosed for this purpose.  Subsection (b)(12) implements an important objective of the DPPAto restrict disclosure of personal information in motor vehicle records to businesses for the purpose of direct marketing and solicitation.  Other exceptions should not be construed to interfere with this objective unless the text commands it.  Reading (b)(4)s in connection with phrase to include solicitation would permit an attorney to use personal information from the state DMV to send bulk solicitations to prospective clients without their express consent, thus creating significant tension between the DPPAs litigation and solicitation exceptions.  Pp.1519.
			

				
				
				(d)Such a reading of (b)(4) could also affect the interpretation of the (b)(6) exception, which allows an insurer and certain others to obtain DMV information for use in connection with ... underwriting, and the (b)(10) exception, which permits disclosure and use of personal information in connection with the operation of private toll roads.  Pp.1920.
			

				
				
				(e)Respondents contend that a line can be drawn between mere trolling for clients and their solicitation, which was tied to a specific legal dispute, but that is not a tenable distinction.  The DPPA supports drawing the line at solicitation.  Solicitation can aid an attorney in bringing a lawsuit or increasing its size, but the question is whether or not lawyers can use personal information protected under the DPPA for this purpose.  The mere fact that respondents complied with state bar rules governing solicitations also does not resolve whether they were entitled to access personal information from the state DMV database for that purpose.  In determining whether obtaining, using, or disclosing personal information is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendants purpose was to solicit, which might be evident from the communication itself or from the defendants course of conduct.  When that is the predominant purpose, (b)(4) does not entitle attorneys to DPPA-protected information even when solicitation is to aggregate a class action.  Attorneys also have other alternatives to aggregate a class, including, e.g. soliciting plaintiffs through traditional and permitted advertising.  And they may obtain DPPA-protected information for a proper investigative use.  
			

				
				
				Although the Fourth Circuit held that the letters here were solicitations, it found the communications nonetheless exempt under (b)(4) because they were inextricably intertwined with permissible litigation purposes.  If however, the use of DPPA-protected personal information has the predominant purpose of solicitation, it would not be protected by (b)(4).  A remand is necessary for the court to apply the proper standard to determine the predominant purpose of respondents letters.  Pp.2026.
			

				
				
				(f)There is no work for the rule of lenity to do here, because the DPPAs text and structure resolve any ambiguity in (b)(4)s phrases in connection with and investigation in anticipation of litigation.  Pp.2627. 
			

				
				
				(g)On remand, the courts below must determine whether respondents letters, viewed objectively, had the predominant purpose of solicitation, and may address whether respondents conduct was permissible under (b)(1)s governmental-function exception and any other defenses that have been properly preserved.

				FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. ACTAVIS, INC., etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 12416.Argued March 25, 2013Decided June 17, 2013
			

				The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act or Act) creates special procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug manufacturers, one of which requires a prospective generic manufacturer to assure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it will not infringe the brand-names patents.  One way to provide such assurance (the paragraph IV route) is by certifying that any listed, relevant patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the generic drug.  

21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV).  
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Solvay Pharmaceuticals obtained a patent for its approved brand-name drug AndroGel.  Subsequently, respondents Actavis and Paddock filed applications for generic drugs modeled after AndroGel and certified under paragraph IV that Solvays patent was invalid and that their drugs did not infringe it.  Solvay sued Actavis and Paddock, claiming patent infringement.  See 

35 U.S.C. 271(e)(2)(A).  The FDA eventually approved Actavis generic product, but instead of bringing its drug to market, Actavis entered into a reverse payment settlement agreement with Solvay, agreeing not to bring its generic to market for a specified number of years and agreeing to promote AndroGel to doctors in exchange for millions of dollars.  Paddock made a similar agreement with Solvay, as did respondent Par, another manufacturer aligned in the patent litigation with Paddock.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed suit, alleging that respondents violated 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by unlawfully agreeing to abandon their patent challenges, to refrain from launching their low-cost generic drugs, and to share in Solvays monopoly profits.  The District Court dismissed the complaint.  The Eleventh Circuit concluded that as long as the anticompetitive effects of a settlement fall within the scope of the patents exclusionary potential, the settlement is immune from antitrust attack.  Noting that the FTC had not alleged that the challenged agreements excluded competition to a greater extent than would the patent, if valid, it affirmed the complaints dismissal.  It further recognized that if parties to this sort of case do not settle, a court might declare a patent invalid.  But since public policy favors the settlement of disputes, it held that courts could not require parties to continue to litigate in order to avoid antitrust liability.
			

				Held:The Eleventh Circuit erred in affirming the dismissal of the FTCs complaint.  Pp.821.
			

				
				
				(a)Although the anticompetitive effects of the reverse settlement agreement might fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of Solvays patent, this does not immunize the agreement from antitrust attack.  For one thing, to refer simply to what the holder of a valid patent could do does not by itself answer the antitrust question.  Here, the paragraph IV litigation put the patents validity and preclusive scope at issue, and the parties settlementin which, the FTC alleges, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants millions to stay out of its market, even though the defendants had no monetary claim against the plaintiffended that litigation.  That form of settlement is unusual, and there is reason for concern that such settlements tend to have significant adverse effects on competition.  It would be incongruous to determine antitrust legality by measuring the settlements anticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy, and not against procompetitive antitrust policies as well.  Both are relevant in determining the scope of monopoly and antitrust immunity conferred by a patent, see, e.g., United States v. Line Material Co., 

333 U.S. 287
, and the antitrust question should be answered by considering traditional antitrust factors.  For another thing, this Courts precedents make clear that patent-related settlement agreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.  See, e.g., United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 

374 U.S. 174
; United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc., 

342 U.S. 371
; Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 

283 U.S. 163
.  Finally, the Hatch-Waxman Acts general procompetitive thrustfacilitating challenges to a patents validity and requiring parties to a paragraph IV dispute to report settlement terms to federal antitrust regulatorssuggests a view contrary to the Eleventh Circuits.  Pp.814.
			

				
				
				(b)While the Eleventh Circuits conclusion finds some support in a general legal policy favoring the settlement of disputes, its related underlying practical concern consists of its fear that antitrust scrutiny of a reverse payment agreement would require the parties to engage in time-consuming, complex, and expensive litigation to demonstrate what would have happened to competition absent the settlement.  However, five sets of considerations lead to the conclusion that this concern should not determine the result here and that the FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove its antitrust claim.  First, the specific restraint at issue has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.  FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 

476 U.S. 447
461.  Payment for staying out of the market keeps prices at patentee-set levels and divides the benefit between the patentee and the challenger, while the consumer loses.  And two Hatch-Waxman Act featuresthe 180-day exclusive-right-to-sell advantage given to the first paragraph IV challenger to win FDA approval, 355(j)(5)(B)(iv), and the roughly 30-month period that the subsequent manufacturers would be required to wait out before winning FDA approval, 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)mean that a reverse settlement agreement with the first filer removes from consideration the manufacturer most likely to introduce competition quickly.  Second, these anticompetitive consequences will at least sometimes prove unjustified.  There may be justifications for reverse payment that are not the result of having sought or brought about anticompetitive consequences, but that does not justify dismissing the FTCs complaint without examining the potential justifications.  Third, where a reverse payment threatens to work unjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely has the power to bring about that harm in practice.  The size of the payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a generic challenger is a strong indicator of such power.  Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more feasible administratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed.  It is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question.  A large, unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable surrogate for a patents weakness, all without forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of the patents validity.  Fifth, the fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does not prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuits.  As in other industries, they may settle in other ways, e.g., by allowing the generic manufacturer to enter the patentees market before the patent expires without the patentees paying the challenger to stay out prior to that point.  Pp.1420.
			

				
				
				(c)This Court declines to hold that reverse payment settlement agreements are presumptively unlawful.  Courts reviewing such agreements should proceed by applying the rule of reason, rather than under a quick look approach.  See California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 

526 U.S. 756
, n.12.  Pp.2021.

And two Hatch-Waxman Act featuresthe 180-day exclusive-right-to-sell advantage given to the first paragraph IV challenger to win FDA approval, 355(j)(5)(B)(iv), and the roughly 30-month period that the subsequent manufacturers would be required to wait out before winning FDA approval, 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)mean that a reverse settlement agreement with the first filer removes from consideration the manufacturer most likely to introduce competition quickly.  Second, these anticompetitive consequences will at least sometimes prove unjustified.  There may be justifications for reverse payment that are not the result of having sought or brought about anticompetitive consequences, but that does not justify dismissing the FTCs complaint without examining the potential justifications.  Third, where a reverse payment threatens to work unjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely has the power to bring about that harm in practice.  The size of the payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a generic challenger is a strong indicator of such power.  Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more feasible administratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed.  It is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question.  A large, unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable surrogate for a patents weakness, all without forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of the patents validity.  Fifth, the fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does not prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuits.  As in other industries, they may settle in other ways, e.g., by allowing the generic manufacturer to enter the patentees market before the patent expires without the patentees paying the challenger to stay out prior to that point.  Pp.1420.
			

				
				
				(c)This Court declines to hold that reverse payment settlement agreements are presumptively unlawful.  Courts reviewing such agreements should proceed by applying the rule of reason, rather than under a quick look approach.  See California Dental Assn. v. FTC,

			The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) established procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug manufacturers. One procedure requires a prospective generic manufacturer to certify to the FDA that any listed, relevant patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the generic drug (paragraph IV). Generic manufacturers filed paragraph IV applications for generic drugs modeled after Solvays FDA-approved, patented drug AndroGel. Solvay claimed patent infringement, 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(2)(A). The FDA approved the generic product, but the generic companies entered into reverse payment settlements, agreeing not to bring the generic to market for a number of years and to promote AndroGel to doctors in exchange for millions of dollars. The FTC sued, alleging violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by agreeing to abandon patent challenges, to refrain from launching low-cost generic drugs, and to share in Solvays monopoly profits. The district court dismissed. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, calling for application of a rule of reason approach rather than a quick look.  Although the anti-competitive effects of the reverse settlement might fall within the exclusionary potential of Solvays patent, the agreement is not immune from antitrust attack. It would be incongruous to determine antitrust legality by looking only at patent law policy, and not at antitrust policies. The Court noted the Hatch-Waxman Acts general pro-competitive thrust, facilitating challenges to a patents validity and requiring parties to a paragraph IV dispute to report settlement terms to antitrust regulators. Payment for staying out of the market keeps prices at patentee-set levels and divides the benefit between the patentee and the challenger, while the consumer loses. That a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does not prevent parties from settling their lawsuits; they may settle in other ways, e.g., by allowing the generic to enter the market before the patent expires without payment to stay out prior to that point.

				No. 1271.Argued March 18, 2013Decided June 17, 2013
			

				The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires States to accept and use a uniform federal form to register voters for federal elections.  

42 U.S.C. 1973gg4(a)(1).  That Federal Form, developed by the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC), requires only that an applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a citizen.  Arizona law, however, requires voter-registration officials to reject any application for registration, including a Federal Form, that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship.  Respondents, a group of individual Arizona residents and a group of nonprofit organizations, sought to enjoin that Arizona law.  Ultimately, the District Court granted Arizona summary judgment on respondents claim that the NVRA pre-empts Arizonas requirement.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed as relevant here, holding that the state laws documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement is pre-empted by the NVRA.  
			

				Held:Arizonas evidence-of-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form applicants, is pre-empted by the NVRAs mandate that States accept and use the Federal Form.  Pp.418.
			

				
				
				(a)The Elections Clause imposes on States the duty to prescribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators, but it confers on Congress the power to alter those regulations or supplant them altogether.  See U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 

514 U.S. 779
805.  This Court has said that the terms Times, Places, and Manner embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections, including regulations relating to registration.  Smiley v. Holm, 

285 U.S. 355
.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)Because accept and use are words that can have more than one meaning, they are given content ... by their surroundings.  Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 

531 U.S. 457
.  Reading accept merely to denote willing receipt seems out of place in the context of an official mandate to accept and use something for a given purpose.  The implication of such a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy.  Arizonas reading is also difficult to reconcile with neighboring NVRA provisions, such as 1973gg6(a)(1)(B) and 1973gg4(a)(2).
			

				
				
				Arizonas appeal to the presumption against pre-emption invoked in this Courts Supremacy Clause cases is inapposite.  The power the Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt.  Because Congress, when it acts under this Clause, is always on notice that its legislation will displace some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States, the reasonable assumption is that the text of Elections Clause legislation accurately communicates the scope of Congresss pre-emptive intent.  
			

				
				
				Nonetheless, while the NVRA forbids States to demand that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the Federal Form, it does not preclude States from deny[ing] registration based on information in their possession establishing the applicants ineligibility.  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				(c)Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.  The latter is the province of the States.  See U.S. Const., Art. I, 2, cl.1; Amdt. 17.  It would raise serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.  The NVRA can be read to avoid such a conflict, however.  Section 1973gg7(b)(1) permits the EAC to include on the Federal Form information necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant.  That validly conferred discretionary executive authority is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to require the inclusion of Arizonas concrete-evidence requirement if such evidence is necessary to enable Arizona to enforce its citizenship qualification.
			

				
				
				The NVRA permits a State to request the EAC to include state-specific instructions on the Federal Form, see 

42 U.S.C. 1973gg7(a)(2), and a State may challenge the EACs rejection of that request (or failure to act on it) in a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act.  That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.  Should the EAC reject or decline to act on a renewed request, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Arizonas concrete-evidence requirement on the Federal Form.  Pp.1317.
			

				677 F.3d 383, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Kennedy, J., joined in part.

				AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS, INC. v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11798.Argued April 16, 2013Decided June 13, 2013
			

				The Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los Angeles, is run by a Board of Harbor Commissioners pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff.  The Port leases marine terminal facilities to operators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships.  Federally licensed short-haul trucks, called drayage trucks, assist in those operations by moving cargo into and out of the Port.  In 2007, in response to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port expansion on traffic, the environment, and safety, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program.  As part of that program, the Board devised a standard-form concession agreement to govern the relationship between the Port and drayage companies.  The agreement requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting concerns, and to submit a plan listing off-street parking locations for each truck.  Other requirements relate to a companys financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of drivers.  The concession agreement sets out penalties for violations, including possible suspension or revocation of the right to provide drayage services.  The Board also amended the Ports tariff to ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.  The amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or imprisonment, for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregistered drayage truck.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), whose members include many of the drayage companies at the Port, sued the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the concession agreements requirements.  ATA principally contended that the requirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), see 

49 U.S.C. 14501(c)(1).  ATA also argued that even if the requirements are valid, Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 

348 U.S. 61
, prevents the Port from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting companys right to operate at the Port.  The District Court held that neither 14501(c)(1) nor Castle prevented the Port from proceeding with its program.  The Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed, finding only the driver-employment provision preempted and rejecting petitioners Castle claim.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The FAAAA expressly preempts the concession agreements placard and parking requirements.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts a state law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.  

49 U.S.C. 14501(c)(1).  Because the parties agree that the Ports placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carriers price, route, or service with respect to transporting property, the only disputed question is whether those requirements hav[e] the force and effect of law.  Section 14501(c)(1) draws a line between a governments exercise of regulatory authority and its own contract-based participation in a market.  The statutes  force and effect of law language excludes from the clauses scope contractual arrangements made by a State when it acts as a market participant, not as a regulator.  See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 

513 U.S. 219
.  But here, the Port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard and parking requirements.  It forced terminal operatorsand through them, trucking companiesto alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment.  That counts as action having the force and effect of law if anything does.
			

				
				
				The Ports primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives rather than means.  But the Ports proprietary intentions do not control.  When the government employs a coercive mechanism, available to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a profit.  Only if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape 14501(c)(1)s preemptive scope.  That the criminal sanctions fall on terminal operators, not directly on the trucking companies, also makes no difference.  See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 

552 U.S. 364
373.  Pp. 610. 
			

				
				
				2.This Court declines to decide in the cases present, pre-enforcement posture whether Castle limits the way the Port can enforce the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements upheld by the Ninth Circuit.  Castle rebuffed a States attempt to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for past infringements of state safety regulations.  But Castle does not prevent a State from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such regulations.  And at this juncture, there is no basis for finding that the Port will actually use the concession agreements penalty provision as Castle proscribes.  Pp.1012.
			

				660 F.3d 384, reversed in part and remanded.
			

				
				
				Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.

			The Port of Los Angeles is run by a Board of Harbor Commissioners under a municipal ordinance (the tariff) and leases terminal facilities to operators that load and unload ships. Federally-licensed short-haul drayage trucks move cargo in and out of the Port. In response to concerns over proposed port expansion, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program that involved a standard concession agreement, governing the relationship between the Port and drayage companies. It required a placard on each truck including a phone number and submission a plan listing off-street parking locations. Other requirements relate to financial capacity, truck maintenance, and drivers. The Board amended the tariff to make it a misdemeanor for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregistered drayage truck. An association of drayage companies  sued, claiming that the requirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), 49 U.S.C. 4501(c)(1), and that even if the requirements are valid, the Port may not enforce them by withdrawing a right to operate at the Port. The district court ruled in favor of the Port. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding only the driver-employment provision preempted. A unanimous Supreme Court reversed in part. The FAAAA expressly preempts the placard and parking requirements, which relate to a motor carriers price, route, or service with respect to transporting property and hav[e] the force and effect of law. The Port exercised classic regulatory authority in forcing terminal operators and, therefore, trucking companies, to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment. The Ports proprietary intentions do not control. The Court declined to determine, in a pre-enforcement posture whether precedent limits the way the Port can enforce the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements.

				TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DISTRICT v. HERRMANN etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 11889.Argued April 23, 2013Decided June 13, 2013
			

				The Red River Compact (or Compact) is a congressionally sanctioned agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called Reaches, each of which is further divided into smaller subbasins.  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Oklahomas portion of Reach II, subbasin 5.  In Reach II, the Compactrecognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store water during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored water for the benefit of a downstream Stategranted control over the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain minimum levels.  Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States equal rights to the use of subbasin 5s waters when the flow is 3,000 cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, provided no state is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].  Under the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intrastate water administration.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas and its rapidly growing population.  After unsuccessfully attempting to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a water resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of the Red River at a point located in Oklahomas portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II.  Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within Oklahomas borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneously with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRBs enforcement of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.  Pp.922.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Tarrant claims that 5.05(b)(1) creates a borderless common in subbasin 5 in which each of the signatory States may cross each others boundaries to access a shared pool of water.  Tarrant observes that 5.05(b)(1)s equal rights language grants each State an equal entitlement to subbasin 5s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Compacts drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water according to state borders.  The OWRB counters that 5.05(b)(1)s equal rights afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5s excess water within each States own borders, but that its silence on cross-border rights indicates that the Compacts drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory States.  Pp.911.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Because interstate compacts are construed under contract-law principles, see Texas v. New Mexico, 

482 U.S. 124
, the Court begins by examining the Compacts express terms as the best indication of the parties intent.  However, 5.05(b)(1)s silence is, at the very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Compact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on the drafters intent.  Three things persuade the Court that the Compact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties course of dealing.  Pp.1122.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(1)The sovereign States possess an absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use.  Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410.  So, for example, [a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water [within a States boundaries] must ... begin with a strong presumption against defeat of a States title.  United States v. Alaska, 

521 U.S. 1
.  It follows, then, that [i]f any inference at all is to be drawn from silence in compacts touching on the States authority to control their waters, it is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.  Virginia v. Maryland, 

540 U.S. 56
.  Tarrant contends that 5.05(b)(1)s silence infers that the signatory States dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water within its borders.  But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign powers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indication of such devolution, not inscrutable silence.  Tarrant counters that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the water within its borders.  But adopting Tarrants reading would necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States silently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they agreed to the Compact.  Pp.1416.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(2)Looking to the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties intent.  See, e.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, 

560 U.S. 330
, ___.  Many compacts feature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross each others borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and many provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships will operate.  The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never intended to be part of the agreement.  Tarrant claims that not all interstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such compact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to any contemplated diversions.  Similarly, even if 2.05(d) of the Compact, which gives [e]ach Signatory State ... the right to [u]se the bed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according to this Compact, is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does so through express language, not through an inference from silence.  Pp.1620.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(3)The parties conduct under the Compact also undermines Tarrants position.  See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S., at ___.  Once the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed for a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007.  And Tarrants earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange decision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water without payment.  Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any other Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of cross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signatory States has ever made such a claim.  P.20.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(4)Tarrants remaining argumentsthat its interpretation is necessary to realize the structure and purpose of Reach II; and that 5.05(b)(1)s 25 percent cap on each States access to subbasin 5s ex-cess water implies that if a State cannot access sufficient water within its borders to meet the cap, it must be able to cross borders to reach that waterare unpersuasive.  Pp.2022.  
			

				
				
				2.The Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Commerce Clause.  Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the Compact from being distributed out of State.  But Tarrants assumption that some water is left unallocated is incorrect.  The interpretive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the flow is above 3,000 CFS, all states are free to use whatever amount of water they can put to beneficial use, subject to the requirement that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses, each state will honor the others right to 25% of the excess flow.  If more than 25 percent of subbasin 5s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is not unallocated; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.

				No. 11889.Argued April 23, 2013Decided June 13, 2013
			

				The Red River Compact (or Compact) is a congressionally sanctioned agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called Reaches, each of which is further divided into smaller subbasins.  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Oklahomas portion of Reach II, subbasin 5.  In Reach II, the Compactrecognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store water during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored water for the benefit of a downstream Stategranted control over the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain minimum levels.

				UNITED STATES v. DAVILA
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 12167.Argued April 15, 2013Decided June 13, 2013
			

				Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 governs guilty pleas.  Rule 11(c)(1) instructs that [t]he court must not participate in [plea] discussions, and Rule 11(h) states that a variance from the requirements of th[e] rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.  Rule 52(a), which covers trial court errors generally, similarly prescribes: Any error ... that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Davila, while under indictment on multiple tax fraud charges, wrote to the District Court, expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorney.  Complaining that his attorney offered no defensive strategy, but simply advised him to plead guilty, Davila requested new counsel.  A Magistrate Judge held an in camera hearing at which Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the United States, appeared.  At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge told Davila that he would not get another court-appointed attorney and that his best course, given the strength of the Governments case, was to plead guilty.  More than three months later, Davila pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of 33 other charges.  He stated under oath before a U.S. District Judge that he had not been forced or pressured to enter the plea, and he did not mention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate Judge.  Prior to sentencing, however, Davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the indictment, asserting that he had entered the plea for a strategic reason, i.e., to force the Government to acknowledge errors in the indictment.  Finding that Davilas plea had been knowing and voluntary, the District Judge denied the motion.  Again, Davila said nothing of the in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge.  On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit, following Circuit precedent, held that the Magistrate Judges violation of Rule 11(c)(1) required automatic vacatur of Davilas guilty plea, obviating any need to inquire whether the error was prejudicial.
			

				Held:Under Rule 11(h), vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davilas decision to plead guilty.  Pp.714.
			

				
				
				(a)Rule 11(c)(1)s prohibition of judicial involvement in plea discussions was included in the 1974 Amendment to the Rule out of concern that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty rather than risk antagonizing the judge who would preside at trial.  Rule 11(h) was added in the 1983 Amendment to make clear that Rule 11 errors are not excepted from Rule 52(a)s harmless-error inquiry.  Rule 52 also states, in subsection (b), that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] courts attention.  When Rule 52(a) governs, the prosecution has the burden of showing harmlessness, but when Rule 52(b) controls, the defendant must show that the error affects substantial rights.  See United States v. Vonn, 

535 U.S. 55
.
			

				
				
				As clarified in Vonn and United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 

542 U.S. 74
, Rule 11 error may be of the Rule 52(a) type or the Rule 52(b) kind, depending on when the error was raised.  In Vonn, the judge who conducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant, as required by Rule 11(c)(3), that he would have the right to the assistance of counsel if he proceeded to trial.  The defendant first objected to the omission on appeal.  This Court held that a silent defendant has the burden to satisfy [Rule 52(b)s] plain-error rule.  535 U.S., at 59.  In Dominguez Benitez, the error first raised on appeal was failure to warn the defendant, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that a plea could not be withdrawn even if the sentence imposed was higher than the plea-bargained sentence recommendation.  The Court again held that Rule 52(b) controlled, and prescribed the standard a defendant silent until appeal must meet to show plain error, namely, a reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have entered the plea.  542 U.S., at 83.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				(b)Here, the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by exhorting Davila to plead guilty.  Davila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1).  He distinguishes plea-colloquy omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt.  The former come into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty, the latter, before a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial.  Nothing in Rule 11s text, however, indicates that the ban on judicial involvement in plea discussions, if dishonored, demands automatic vacatur without regard to case-specific circumstances.  Nor does the Advisory Committee commentary single out any Rule 11 instruction as more basic than others.  And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule).
			

				
				
				Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one impelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional requirement.  Thus, violation of the Rule does not belong in the highly exceptional category of structural errorse.g., denial of counsel of choice or denial of a public trialthat trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.  United States v. Marcus, 

560 U.S. 258
, ___.  Instead, in assessing Rule 11 errors, a reviewing court must take account of all that transpired in the trial court.  Had Davilas guilty plea followed soon after the Magistrate Judges comments, the automatic-vacatur rule would have remained erroneous.  The Court of Appeals mistake in that regard, however, might have been inconsequential, for the Magistrate Judges exhortations, if they immediately elicited a plea, would likely have qualified as prejudicial.  Here, however, three months distanced the in camera meeting conducted by the Magistrate Judge from Davilas appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea after an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, at which Davila had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about matters relating to his plea.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, should not have assessed the Magistrate Judges comments in isolation.  Instead, it should have considered, in light of the full record, whether it was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judges comments, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(c)The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the Magistrate Judges comments violated Rule 11(c)(1), cut off further consideration.  It did not engage in a full-record assessment of the particular facts of Davilas case or the case-specific arguments raised by the parties, including the Governments assertion that Davila was not prejudiced by the Magistrate Judges comments, and Davilas contention that the extraordinary circumstances his case presents should allow his claim to be judged under Rule 52(a)s harmless-error standard rather than Rule 52(b)s plain-error standard.  The Court decides only that the automatic-vacatur rule is incompatible with Rule 11(h) and leaves all remaining issues to be addressed on remand.  P.14.
			

				664 F.3d 1355, vacated and remanded.

Pp.79.
			

				
				
				(b)Here, the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by exhorting Davila to plead guilty.  Davila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1).  He distinguishes plea-colloquy omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt.  The former come into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty, the latter, before a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial.  Nothing in Rule 11s text, however, indicates that the ban on judicial involvement in plea discussions, if dishonored, demands automatic vacatur without regard to case-specific circumstances.  Nor does the Advisory Committee commentary single out any Rule 11 instruction as more basic than others.  And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule).
			

				
				
				Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one impelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional requirement.  Thus, violation of the Rule does not belong in the highly exceptional category of structural errorse.g., denial of counsel of choice or denial of a public trialthat trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.  United States v. Marcus, 

560 U.S. 258
, ___.  Instead, in assessing Rule 11 errors, a reviewing court must take account of all that transpired in the trial court.  Had Davilas guilty plea followed soon after the Magistrate Judges comments, the automatic-vacatur rule would have remained erroneous.  The Court of Appeals mistake in that regard, however, might have been inconsequential, for the Magistrate Judges exhortations, if they immediately elicited a plea, would likely have qualified as prejudicial.  Here, however, three months distanced the in camera meeting conducted by the Magistrate Judge from Davilas appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea after an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, at which Davila had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about matters relating to his plea.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, should not have assessed the Magistrate Judges comments in isolation.  Instead, it should have considered, in light of the full record, whether it was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judges comments, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(c)The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the Magistrate Judges comments violated Rule 11(c)(1), cut off further consideration.  It did not engage in a full-record assessment of the particular facts of Davilas case or the case-specific arguments raised by the parties, including the Governments assertion that Davila was not prejudiced by the Magistrate Judges comments, and Davilas contention that the extraordinary circumstances his case presents should allow his claim to be judged under Rule 52(a)s harmless-error standard rather than Rule 52(b)s plain-error standard.  The Court decides only that the automatic-vacatur rule is incompatible with Rule 11(h) and leaves all remaining issues to be addressed on remand.  P.14.
			

				664 F.3d 1355, vacated and remanded.

			Davila, under indictment on tax fraud charges, wrote to the district court, expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorney, whom, he claimed, simply advised him to plead guilty. Davila requested new counsel. A magistrate held an in camera hearing with Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the prosecution, and told Davila that he would not get another court-appointed attorney and that his best course, given the strength of the prosecutions case, was to plead guilty. More than three months later, Davila pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of 33 other charges. He stated under oath that he was not forced or pressured to enter the plea and did not mention the hearing. Before sentencing, Davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the indictment, asserting that he had entered the plea to force the prosecution to acknowledge errors in the indictment. The district judge denied the motion, finding the plea knowing and voluntary. Davila did not mention the in camera hearing. The Eleventh Circuit held that the magistrates violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), prohibiting court participation in plea discussions, required automatic vacatur.  The Supreme Court vacated, noting that both Rule 11 and Rule 52(a), governing trial court error in general, allow for harmless error. Vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davilas decision to plead guilty. Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one impelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional requirement, so its violation does not belong in the highly exceptional category of structural errors (denial of counsel of choice or denial of a public trial) that trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding. The Court noted that three months elapsed between the in camera meeting and Davilas appearance before the district judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea after an ""exemplary"" Rule 11 colloquy.

				No. 12398.Argued April 15, 2013Decided June 13, 2013
			

				Each human gene is encoded as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which takes the shape of a double helix.  Each cross-bar in that helix consists of two chemically joined nucleotides.  Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids used to build proteins in the body.  The nucleotides that code for amino acids are exons, and those that do not are introns.  Scientists can extract DNA from cells to isolate specific segments for study.  They can also synthetically create exons-only strands of nucleotides known as composite DNA (cDNA).  cDNA contains only the exons that occur in DNA, omitting the intervening introns.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad), obtained several  patents after discovering the precise location and sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, mutations of which can dramatically increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  This knowledge allowed Myriad to determine the genes typical nucleotide sequence, which, in turn, enabled it to develop medical tests useful for detecting mutations in these genes in a particular patient to assess the patients cancer risk.  If valid, Myriads patents would give it the exclusive right to isolate an individuals BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and would give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create BRCA cDNA.  Petitioners filed suit, seeking a declaration that Myriads patents are invalid under 

35 U.S.C. 101.  As relevant here, the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners, concluding that Myriads claims were invalid because they covered products of nature.  The Federal Circuit initially reversed, but on remand in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. ___, the Circuit found both isolated DNA and cDNA patent eligible.  
			

				Held:A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.  Pp.1018.
			

				
				
				(a)The Patent Act permits patents to be issued to [w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful ... composition of matter, 101, but laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are basic tools of scientific and technological work that lie beyond the domain of patent protection, Mayo, supra, at ___.  The rule against patents on naturally occurring things has limits, however.  Patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery and imped[ing] the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.  Id., at ___.  This standard is used to determine whether Myriads patents claim a new and useful ... composition of matter, 101, or claim naturally occurring phenomena.  Pp.1011.  
			

				
				
				(b)Myriads DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception.  Myriads principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 

447 U.S. 303
, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature, id., at 310.  Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA.  It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the 101 inquiry.  See Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 

333 U.S. 127
.  Finding the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes does not render the genes patent eligible new ... composition[s] of matter, 101.  Myriads patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims: They detail the extensive process of discovery, but extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy 101s demands.  Myriads claims are not saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together.  The claims are not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely on the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA section.  Instead, they focus on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Finally, Myriad argues that the Patent and Trademark Offices past practice of awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing J.E.M.Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Intl, Inc., 

534 U.S. 124

				(c)cDNA is not a product of nature, so it is patent eligible under 101.  cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments.  Its creation results in an exons-only molecule, which is not naturally occurring.  Its order of the exons may be dictated by nature, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when introns are removed from a DNA sequence to make cDNA.  Pp.1617.
			

				
				
				(d)This case, it is important to note, does not involve method claims, patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, or the patentability of DNA in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered.  Pp.1718.

				No. 12123.Argued March 20, 2013Decided June 10, 2013
			

				The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA), which was enacted to stabilize prices for agricultural commodities, regulates only handlers, i.e., processors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling of covered agricultural commodities, 

7 U.S.C. 608c(1).  Any handler that violates the Secretary of Agricultures marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.  608a(5), 608a(6), and 608c(14).  One such order, the California Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a particular years production should be included in the pool.  The Order also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the RACs administrative costs.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioners, California raisin growers, started a business that processed more than 3 million pounds of raisins from their farm and 60 other farms during the two crop years.  When they refused to surrender the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceedings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to retain raisins in reserve and pay assessments.  Petitioners countered that as producers, they were not subject to the Order.  They also raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the 
 
Fifth Amendments prohibition against taking property without just compensation.  An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order, and rejected their takings defense.  On appeal, a judicial officer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to address the takings claim.  Petitioners sought review in the Federal District Court.  Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found that substantial evidence supported the agencys determination that petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected petitioners takings claim.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It agreed that petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims.  It recognized that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAAs comprehensive remedial scheme, see 

7 U.S.C. 608c(15), but found that petitioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.  
			

				Held:The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners takings claim.  Pp.915.
			

				
				
				(a)That court incorrectly determined that petitioners brought their takings claim as producers rather than handlers.  Petitioners argued that they were producersand thus not subject to the AMAA or the Marketing Orderbut both the USDA and the District Court concluded that they were handlers.  And the fines and civil penalties for failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity.  Because the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers, their takings claim raised as a defense against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity.  In finding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit confused petitioners statutory argument that they were producers with their constitutional argument that, assuming they were handlers, their fine violated the 
 
Fifth Amendment.  The relevant question is whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order.  Pp.910.
			

				
				
				(b)The Governments claim that petitioners takings-based defense was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds is unpersuasive, and its reliance on Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 

473 U.S. 172
, is misplaced.  There, a plaintiffs claim that a zoning decision effected a taking without just compensation was not ripe.  But the claim failed because the plaintiff could not show that it had been injured by the Governments action when there had been no final decision.  Here, petitioners were subject to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties.  The takings claim in Williamson County was also not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought compensation through the procedures [provided by] the State.  Id., at 194.  The Government argues that petitioners takings claim is premature because the Tucker Act affords a remedy, but, in fact, the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handlers takings claim.  As a result, there is no alternative remedy.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(c)A takings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the USDA under 608c(14).  The provisions text does not bar handlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDAs enforcement action.  Allowing handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges to marketing orders under 608c(15)(A), for a handler who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitutional challenge fails.  It would also make little sense to force a party to pay an assessed fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.  See Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 

524 U.S. 498

The California Raisin Marketing Order, promulgated under the AMAA, established a Raisin Administrative Committee, which recommends annual reserve pools of raisins not to be sold on the open domestic market and requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover administrative costs. The petitioners, raisin producers, refused to surrender requisite portions of raisins to the reserve. The USDA began administrative proceedings. An ALJ found that petitioners were handlers and had violated the AMAA and the Order, and rejected a takings defense. The district court entered summary judgment for the USDA. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. A unanimous Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction to decide the takings claim. Petitioners argued that they were producers, not subject to the AMAA or the Order, but the USDA and the district court concluded that they were handlers. Fines and penalties were levied on them in that capacity. Their takings claim, therefore, was necessarily raised in that capacity. The Ninth Circuit confused a statutory argument that they were producers with a constitutional argument that, if they were handlers, their fine violated the Fifth Amendment. The claim was ripe. The petitioners were subject to a final agency order; because the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handlers takings claim, there is no alternative remedy.

				No. 12135.Argued March 25, 2013Decided June 10, 2013
			

				Respondent Sutter, a pediatrician, provided medical services to petitioner Oxford Health Plans insureds under a fee-for-services contract that required binding arbitration of contractual disputes.  He nonetheless filed a proposed class action in New Jersey Superior Court, alleging that Oxford failed to fully and promptly pay him and other physicians with similar Oxford contracts.  On Oxfords motion, the court compelled arbitration.  The parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration, and he concluded that it did.  Oxford filed a motion in federal court to vacate the arbitrators decision, claiming that he had exceeded [his] powers under 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 

9 U.S.C. 1 et. seq.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Third Circuit affirmed.
			

				
				
				
				
				After this Court decided Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Intl Corp.,

Oxford renewed its motion to vacate that decision under 10(a)(4).  The District Court denied the motion, and the Third Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:The arbitrators decision survives the limited judicial review allowed by 10(a)(4).  Pp.49.
			

				
				
				(a)A party seeking relief under 10(a)(4) bears a heavy burden.  It is not enough ... to show that the [arbitrator] committed an erroror even a serious error.  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S., at 671.  Because the parties bargained for the arbitrators construction of their agreement, an arbitral decision even arguably construing or applying the contract must stand, regardless of a courts view of its (de)merits.  Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 

531 U.S. 57
.  Thus, the sole question on judicial review is whether the arbitrator interpreted the parties contract, not whether he construed it correctly.  Here, the arbitrator twice did what the parties asked: He considered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to permit class proceedings.  That suffices to show that he did not exceed his powers under  10(a)(4).  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)Stolt-Neilsen does not support Oxfords contrary view.  There, the parties stipulated that they had not reached an agreement on class arbitration, so the arbitrators did not construe the contract, and did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings.  This Court thus found not that they had misinterpreted the contract but that they had abandoned their interpretive role.  Here, in stark contrast, the arbitrator did construe the contract, and did find an agreement to permit class arbitration.  So to overturn his decision, this Court would have to find that he misapprehended the parties intent.  But 10(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task poorly.  Oxfords remaining arguments go to the merits of the arbitrators contract interpretation and are thus irrelevant under 10(a)(4).  Pp.69.

				PEUGH v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
			

				No. 1262.Argued February 26, 2013Decided June 10, 2013
			

				Petitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct that occurred in 1999 and 2000.  At sentencing, he argued that the Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998 version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time of sentencing.  Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peughs sentencing range was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months.  The District Court rejected Peughs ex post facto claim and sentenced him to 70 months imprisonment.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
			

				675 F.3d 736, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIIC, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.  Pp.413, 1520.
			

				
				
				(a)Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 

543 U.S. 220
, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing procedures.  A district court must begin by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range, Gall v. United States, 

552 U.S. 38
, and then consider the parties arguments and factors specified in 

18 U.S.C. 3553(a).  552 U.S., at 4950.  The court may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable, id., at 50, and must explain the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid.  On appeal, a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.  Id., at 51.  A district court is to apply the Guidelines in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced, 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a category including, as relevant here, [e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.  Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390.  The scope of this Latin phrase is given substance by an accretion of case law.  Dobbert v. Florida, 

432 U.S. 282
.  The touchstone of the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.  Garner v. Jones, 

529 U.S. 244
.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				(c)The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 

482 U.S. 423
.  There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the petitioner was sentenced under Floridas new sentencing guidelines, which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place at the time of his crime.  The pre-existing guidelines would have required the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been reviewable on appeal.  But under the new guidelines, a sentence within the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.  Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sentence.  Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a significant risk of a higher sentence.
			

				
				
				The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines.  Normally, a judge will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and impose a sentence within the range.  Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  That the court may impose a sentence outside that range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing.  Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for reasonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark.  Appellate courts may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v. United States, 

551 U.S. 338
, and may consider the extent of the deviation from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness review, Gall, 552 U.S., at 51.  The sentencing regime also puts in place procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-Guidelines sentence less likely.  Floridas scheme and the federal regime differ, but those differences are not dispositive.  Common sense indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evidence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect.  A retrospective increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(d)The Governments contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  Its principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the status of a law within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Changes in law need not bind a sentencing authority for there to be an expost facto violation, and [t]he presence of discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.  Garner, 529 U.S., at 253.  As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two systems is one in degree, not in kind.  The attributes of post-Booker sentencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-Booker 
 
Sixth Amendment cases.  The Courts 
 
Sixth Amendment cases, which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a significant risk of a higher sentence.  The Booker remedy was designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a 
 
Sixth Amendment violation.  Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall.  Pp.1519.

				HILLMAN v. MARETTA
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
			

				No. 111221.Argued April 22, 2013Decided June 3, 2013
			

				The Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA) establishes an insurance program for federal employees.  FEGLIA permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds, and specifies an order of precedence providing that an employees death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential recipients.  

5 U.S.C. 8705(a).  A Virginia statute revokes a beneficiary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a former spouse where there has been a change in the decedents marital status.  Va. Code Ann. 20111.1(A) (Section A).  In the event that this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the former spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the party who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.  20111.1(D).
			

				
				
				
				
				Warren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as the beneficiary of his Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) policy.  After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary.  After Warrens death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for the FEGLI proceeds and collected them.  Hillman sued in Virginia court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D.  Maretta argued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law.  The parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted.  The Virginia Circuit Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the FEGLI policy proceeds.  The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with the purposes and objectives of Congress.
			

				Held:Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.  Pp.615.
			

				
				
				(a) State law is pre-empted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.  Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 

530 U.S. 363
.  This case raises the question whether Virginia law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.  Hines v. Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52
.  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress purposes and objectives, the nature of the federal interest must first be ascertained.  Crosby, 530 U.S., at 372373.  Two previous cases govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and FEGLIA here.  In Wissner v. Wissner, 

338 U.S. 655
, a California court granted a decedents widow, who was not the named beneficiary of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community property under state law.  This Court reversed.  Because NSLIA provided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that Congress had spoken with force and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.  Id., at 658.  The Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Servicemens Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v. Ridgway, 

454 U.S. 46
.  There, a Maine court imposed a constructive trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemembers widow, the named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedents first wife as required by a divorce decree.  Holding the constructive trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner controlled and that SGLIA made clear that the insured service member possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to the proper office.  Id., at 56.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal force here.  NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA, which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insureds designated beneficiary, 8705(a), and which underscores that the employees right of designation cannot be waived or restricted, 5 CFR 843.205(e).  Section D interferes with this scheme, because it directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by a third party.  FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and evinces Congress decision to accord federal employees an unfettered freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the proceeds actually belong to that beneficiary.  This conclusion is confirmed by another provision of FEGLIA, 8705(e), which creates a limited exception to the order of precedence by allowing proceeds to be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary, if, and only if, the requisite documentation is filed with the Government before the employees death, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the federal system.

				HILLMAN v. MARETTA
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
			

				No. 111221.Argued April 22, 2013Decided June 3, 2013
			

				The Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA) establishes an insurance program for federal employees.  FEGLIA permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds, and specifies an order of precedence providing that an employees death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential recipients.  

5 U.S.C. 8705(a).  A Virginia statute revokes a beneficiary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a former spouse where there has been a change in the decedents marital status.  Va. Code Ann. 20111.1(A) (Section A).  In the event that this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the former spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the party who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.  20111.1(D).
			

				
				
				
				
				Warren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as the beneficiary of his Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) policy.  After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary.  After Warrens death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for the FEGLI proceeds and collected them.  Hillman sued in Virginia court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D.  Maretta argued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law.  The parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted.  The Virginia Circuit Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the FEGLI policy proceeds.  The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with the purposes and objectives of Congress.
			

				Held:Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.  Pp.615.
			

				
				
				(a) State law is pre-empted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.  Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 

530 U.S. 363
.  This case raises the question whether Virginia law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.  Hines v. Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52
.  Pp.613.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress purposes and objectives, the nature of the federal interest must first be ascertained.  Crosby, 530 U.S., at 372373.  Two previous cases govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and FEGLIA here.  In Wissner v. Wissner, 

338 U.S. 655
, a California court granted a decedents widow, who was not the named beneficiary of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community property under state law.  This Court reversed.  Because NSLIA provided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that Congress had spoken with force and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.  Id., at 658.  The Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Servicemens Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v. Ridgway, 

454 U.S. 46
.  There, a Maine court imposed a constructive trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemembers widow, the named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedents first wife as required by a divorce decree.  Holding the constructive trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner controlled and that SGLIA made clear that the insured service member possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to the proper office.  Id., at 56.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal force here.  NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA, which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insureds designated beneficiary, 8705(a), and which underscores that the employees right of designation cannot be waived or restricted, 5 CFR 843.205(e).  Section D interferes with this scheme, because it directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by a third party.  FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and evinces Congress decision to accord federal employees an unfettered freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the proceeds actually belong to that beneficiary.  This conclusion is confirmed by another provision of FEGLIA, 8705(e), which creates a limited exception to the order of precedence by allowing proceeds to be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary, if, and only if, the requisite documentation is filed with the Government before the employees death, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the federal system.  If States could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure Congress established, 8705(e)s narrow exception would be transformed into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.  Pp.913.
			

				
				
				(b)Hillmans additional arguments in support of a different result are unpersuasive.  Pp.1315.
			

				283 Va. 34, 722 S.E. 2d 32, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined as to all but footnote 4.  Thomas, J., and Alito, J., filed opinions concurring in the judgment.

				MARYLAND v. KING
			

				certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland
			

				No. 12207.Argued February 26, 2013Decided June 3, 2013
			

				After his 2009 arrest on first- and second-degree assault charges, respondent King was processed through a Wicomico County, Maryland, facility, where booking personnel used a cheek swab to take a DNA sample pursuant to the Maryland DNA Collection Act (Act).  The swab was matched to an unsolved 2003 rape, and King was charged with that crime.  He moved to suppress the DNA match, arguing that the Act violated the 
 
Fourth Amendment, but the Circuit Court Judge found the law constitutional.  King was convicted of rape.  The Maryland Court of Appeals set aside the conviction, finding unconstitutional the portions of the Act authorizing DNA collection from felony arrestees.  
			

				Held:When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestees DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Pp.328.
			

				
				
				(a)DNA testing may significantly improve both the criminal justice system and police investigative practices, District Attorneys Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 

557 U.S. 52
, by making it possible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty, id., at 62.  Marylands Act authorizes law enforcement authorities to collect DNA samples from, as relevant here, persons charged with violent crimes, including first-degree assault.  A sample may not be added to a database before an individual is arraigned, and it must be destroyed if, e.g., he is not convicted.  Only identity information may be added to the database.  Here, the officer collected a DNA sample using the common buccal swab procedure, which is quick and painless, requires no surgical intrusio[n] beneath the skin, Winston v. Lee, 

470 U.S. 753
, and poses no threat to the arrestees health or safety, id., at 763.  Respondents identification as the rapist resulted in part through the operation of the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which connects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national level, and which standardizes the points of comparison, i.e., loci, used in DNA analysis.  Pp.37.
			

				
				
				(b)The framework for deciding the issue presented is well established.  Using a buccal swab inside a persons cheek to obtain a DNA sample is a search under the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  And the fact that the intrusion is negligible is of central relevance to determining whether the search is reasonable, the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search, Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 

515 U.S. 646
.  Because the need for a warrant is greatly diminished here, where the arrestee was already in valid police custody for a serious offense supported by probable cause, the search is analyzed by reference to reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, Samson v. California, 

547 U.S. 843
, n.4, and reasonableness is determined by weighing the promotion of legitimate governmental interests against the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individuals privacy, Wyoming v. Houghton, 

526 U.S. 295
.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				(c)In this balance of reasonableness, great weight is given to both the significant government interest at stake in the identification of arrestees and DNA identifications unmatched potential to serve that interest.  Pp.1023.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The Act serves a well-established, legitimate government interest: the need of law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and identify persons and possessions taken into custody.  [P]robable cause provides legal justification for arresting a [suspect], and for a brief period of detention to take the administrative steps incident to arrest, Gerstein v. Pugh, 

420 U.S. 103
114; and the validity of the search of a person incident to a lawful arrest is settled, United States v. Robinson, 

414 U.S. 218
.  Individual suspicion is not necessary.  The routine administrative procedure[s] at a police station house incident to booking and jailing the suspect have different origins and different constitutional justifications than, say, the search of a place not incident to arrest, Illinois v. Lafayette, 

462 U.S. 640
, which depends on the fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place, Illinois v. Gates, 

462 U.S. 213
.  And when probable cause exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society and hold him in legal custody, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.  First, the government has an interest in properly identifying who has been arrested and who is being tried.  Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., 

542 U.S. 177
.  Criminal history is critical to officers who are processing a suspect for detention.  They already seek identity information through routine and accepted means: comparing booking photographs to sketch artists depictions, showing mugshots to potential witnesses, and comparing fingerprints against electronic databases of known criminals and unsolved crimes.  The only difference between DNA analysis and fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy DNA provides.  DNA is another metric of identification used to connect the arrestee with his or her public persona, as reflected in records of his or her actions that are available to the police.  Second, officers must ensure that the custody of an arrestee does not create inordinate risks for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee.  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 566 U.S. ___, ___.  DNA allows officers to know the type of person being detained.  Third, the Government has a substantial interest in ensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for trials.  Bell v. Wolfish, 

441 U.S. 520
.  An arrestee may be more inclined to flee if he thinks that continued contact with the criminal justice system may expose another serious offense.  Fourth, an arrestees past conduct is essential to assessing the danger he poses to the public, which will inform a courts bail determination.  Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a previous violent crime based on DNA identification may be especially probative in this regard.  Finally, in the interests of justice, identifying an arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned.  Pp.1018.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)DNA identification is an important advance in the techniques long used by law enforcement to serve legitimate police concerns.  Police routinely have used scientific advancements as standard procedures for identifying arrestees.  Fingerprinting, perhaps the most direct historical analogue to DNA technology, has, from its advent, been viewed as a natural part of the administrative steps incident to arrest.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 

500 U.S. 44
.  However, DNA identification is far superior.  The additional intrusion upon the arrestees privacy beyond that associated with fingerprinting is not significant, and DNA identification is markedly more accurate.  It may not be as fast as fingerprinting, but rapid fingerprint analysis is itself of recent vintage, and the question of how long it takes to process identifying information goes to the efficacy of the search for its purpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality of the search.  Rapid technical advances are also reducing DNA processing times.  Pp.1823.
			

				
				
				(d)The government interest is not outweighed by respondents privacy interests.  Pp.2328.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)By comparison to the substantial government interest and the unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is minimal.  Reasonableness must be considered in the context of an individuals legitimate privacy expectations, which necessarily diminish when he is taken into police custody.  Bell, supra, at 557.  Such searches thus differ from the so-called special needs searches of, e.g., otherwise law-abiding motorists at checkpoints.  See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 

531 U.S. 32
.  The reasonableness inquiry considers two other circumstances in which particularized suspicion is not categorically required: diminished expectations of privacy [and a] minimal intrusion.  Illinois v. McArthur, 

531 U.S. 326
.  An invasive surgery may raise privacy concerns weighty enough for the search to require a warrant, notwithstanding the arrestees diminished privacy expectations, but a buccal swab, which involves a brief and minimal intrusion with virtually no risk, trauma, or pain, Schmerber v. California, 

384 U.S. 757
, does not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of arrest.  Pp.2326.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The processing of respondents DNA samples CODIS loci also did not intrude on his privacy in a way that would make his DNA identification unconstitutional.  Those loci came from noncoding DNA parts that do not reveal an arrestees genetic traits and are unlikely to reveal any private medical information.  Even if they could provide such information, they are not in fact tested for that end.  Finally, the Act provides statutory protections to guard against such invasions of privacy.  Pp.2628.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				NEVADA, etal., PETITIONERS v. CALVIN ONEIL JACKSON
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 12694.Decided June 3, 2013
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				In this case, the Court of Appeals held that respondent, who was convicted of rape and other serious crimes, is en- titled to relief under the federal habeas statute because the Supreme Court of Nevada unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent regarding a crim- inal defendants constitutional right to present a defense.  At his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim previously reported that he had assaulted her but that the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations. The state supreme court held that this evidence was properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence violated respondents federal constitutional rights.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.
			

				I
			

				
				
				Respondent Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decade-long romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon.  In 1998, after several previous attempts to end the relationship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North Las Vegas without telling respondent where she was mov- ing.  Respondent learned of Heathmons whereabouts, and on the night of October 21, 1998, he visited her apartment.  What happened next was the focus of respondents trial.
			

				
				
				Heathmon told police and later testified that respondent forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.  After raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring from her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment and toward his car by the neck and hair.  A witness confronted the couple, and respondent fled.  Police observed injuries to Heathmons neck and scalp that were consis-tent with her account of events, and respondent was eventually arrested.
			

				
				
				Although respondent did not testify at trial, he discussed Heathmons allegations with police shortly after his arrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and she was scared that [he] might do something, Tr. 305, but he claimed that the sex was consensual.  Respondent also admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.
			

				
				
				Shortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would not testify.  She went into hiding, but police eventually found her and took her into custody as a material wit- ness.  Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and agreed to testify.  When asked about the letter at trial, she stated  that three of respondents associates had forced her to write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared in court.
			

				
				
				At trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon had fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to police in an effort to control respondent.  To support that theory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and police reports showing that Heathmon had called the police on several prior occasions claiming that respondent had raped or otherwise assaulted her.  Police were unable to corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in several cases they were skeptical of her claims.  Although the trial court gave the defense wide latitude to cross-examine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as witnesses the officers involved.  The jury found respondent guilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
			

				
				
				Respondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Su- preme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial courts refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right to present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme Court rejected that argument.
			

				
				
				After exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial courts ruling had violated his right to present a defense.  Applying AEDPAs deferential standard of review, the District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.  688 F.3d 1091 (2012).  The majority held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmons prior allegations was critical to respondents defense, that the exclusion of that evidence violated respondents constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada Supreme Courts decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this Courts precedents.  Id., at 10971101.  Although it acknowledged that the state court had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact of the States rules of evidence on the defense was disproportionate to the states interest in ... exclusion.  Id., at 11011104.  Finding that the trial courts erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at 11041106, the Ninth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to release respondent.

				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant relief to a prisoner whose state court conviction involved an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  It is settled that a federal habeas court may overturn a state courts application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state courts decision conflicts with this Courts precedents.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).  Applying that deferential standard, we conclude that the Nevada Supreme Courts decision was reasonable.
			

				
				
				[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense, Crane v. Kentucky, 

476 U.S. 683, 
690 (1986)
 (quoting California v. Trombetta, 

467 U.S. 479, 
485 (1984)
), but we have also recognized that state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials, Holmes v. South Carolina, 

547 U.S. 319, 
324 (2006)
 (quoting United States v. Scheffer, 

523 U.S. 303, 
308 (1998)
).  Only rarely have we held that the right to present a complete defense was violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence.  See 547 U.S., at 331 (rule did not rationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock v. Arkansas, 

483 U.S. 44, 
61 (1987)
 (rule arbitrary); Chambers v. Mississippi, 

410 U.S. 284
303 (1973) (State did not even attempt to explain the reason for its rule); Washington v. Texas, 

388 U.S. 14, 
22 (1967)
 (rule could not be rationally defended).
			

				
				
				As the Ninth Circuit conceded, [t]he Nevada Supreme Court recognized and applied the correct legal principle.  688 F.3d, at 1097.  But contrary to the Ninth Circuits conclusion, the State Supreme Courts application of our clearly established precedents was reasonable.  The starting point in the state courts analysis was a state statute that generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evidence of [s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness credibility, other than conviction of crime.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66; see Nev. Rev. Stat. 50.085(3) (2011).  The purpose of that rule, the Nevada Supreme Court has explained, is to focus the fact-finder on the most impor- tant facts and conserve judicial resources by avoiding mini-trials on collateral issues.  Abbott v. State, 122 Nev. 715, 736, 138 P.3d 462, 476 (2006) (quoting State v. Long, 140 S.W.3d 27, 30 (Mo. 2004)).  These are good reason[s] for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark v. Arizona, 

548 U.S. 735, 
770 (2006)
, and the Nevada statute is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that generally precludes the admission of evidence of specific instances of a witness conduct to prove the witness character for untruthfulness.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence 6.27, pp.497499 (4th ed. 2009).  The constitutional propriety of this rule cannot be seriously disputed.
			

				
				
				As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev. Rev. Stat. 50.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in Miller v. State, 105 Nev. 497, 499500, 779 P.2d 87, 8889 (1989), that in a sexual assault case defense counsel may cross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab- ricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness denies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic evidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by that witness in the past.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66.  But in order to introduce evidence showing that the witness previously made false allegations, the defendant must file written notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.  Miller, supra, at 501, 779 P.2d, at 90.  Respondent did not file the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault complaints on this basis.
			

				
				
				No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this notice requirement is unconstitutional.  Nor, contrary to the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F. 3d, at 11031104, do our cases clearly establish that the Constitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests before such a rule can be enforced.  The decision on which the Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, 

500 U.S. 145 (1991)
, is very far afield.  In that case, we reversed a decision holding that the 
 
Sixth Amendment categorically prohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape defendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to introduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the complaining witness.  The Court did not even suggest, much less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such a rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs in favor of enforcement.  Instead, the Court express[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in th[at] case and left it for the state courts to address that question in the first instance.  Id., at 153.  No fair-minded jurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the enforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent with the Constitution.
			

				
				
				Some of the evidence that respondent sought to in- troduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re- ported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually assault her, and the state supreme court did not view its Miller decision as applying in such circumstances.  But the state court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev. Rev. Stat. 50.085(3).  Rather, the court reasoned that the proffered evidence had little impeachment value because at most it showed simply that the victims reports could not be corroborated.  The admission of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness conduct to impeach the witness credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly prolong the trial.  No decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons in a particular case violates the Constitution.
			

				
				
				In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,  the Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA decisions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners who were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination of the witnesses against them.  688 F.3d, at 10981101 (discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriffs Dept., 421 F.3d 1027, 10351038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yarborough, 568 F.3d 1091, 10981101 (CA9 2009)).  Those cases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding that various restrictions on a defendants ability to cross-examine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 

488 U.S. 227, 
231 (1988)
 (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 

475 U.S. 673
679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, 

415 U.S. 308
316 (1974).  But this Court has never held that the Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to introduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.  See Delaware v. Fensterer, 

474 U.S. 15, 
22 (1985)
 (percuriam) (observing that the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to ... expose [testimonial] infirmities through cross-examination).  See also Jordan v. Warden, 675 F.3d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F.3d 62, 70 (CA1 2011).
			

				
				
				The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-examination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the cases as recognizing a broad right to present evidence bearing on [a witness] credibility.  688 F.3d, at 1099.  By framing our precedents at such a high level of generality, a lower federal court could transform even the most imaginative extension of existing case law into clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.  

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  In thus collapsing the distinction between an unreasonable application of federal law and what a lower court believes to be an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law, Williams v. Taylor, 

529 U.S. 362, 
412 (2000)
, the Ninth Circuits approach would defeat the substantial deference that AEDPA requires.
			

				
				
				The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				
It is so ordered.

			In 1998, defendant allegedly forced his way into the apartment of his former girlfriend, Heathmon,raped and hit her, stole a ring, and dragged her outside by the neck and hair. A witness confronted him and defendant fled. Police observed injuries to Heathmons neck and scalp, consistent with her account. Defendant was arrested. Although he did not testify at trial, his statements to police were admitted into evidence. He claimed that the sex was consensual and denied dragging Heathmon, but admitted that she might have felt threatened and that he hit her.

At trial, the defense sought to introduce testimony and police reports showing that Heathmon had called the police on  prior occasions claiming that defendant had raped or assaulted her.

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. After exhausting state remedies, defendant filed a federal habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. 2254(d). The district court denied relief, but a divided Ninth Circuit reversed, finding violation of defendants constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada Supreme Courts decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Nevada Supreme Courts decision was reasonable. The Constitution grants broad latitude in establishing rules excluding evidence from criminal trials. The Nevada statute generally precludes admission of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness credibility, other than conviction of crime, Nev. Rev. Stat. 50.085(3). The state has good reason[s] for limiting use of extrinsic evidence, and its statute is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence. The statute has an exception for previous fabricated sexual assault accusations, but the defendant must file written notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing. Defendant did not file the requisite notice.  No decision of the Supreme Court clearly establishes that the notice requirement is unconstitutional. Some of the evidence that defendant sought to introduce concerned prior incidents that did not involve alleged sexual assault; the state court reasoned that the proffered evidence had little impeachment value because it showed simply that the victims reports could not be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness conduct to impeach the witness may confuse the jury, unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly prolong a trial. The Supreme Court has never held that the Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to introduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment.

				In Martinez v. Ryan, 

566 U.S. 1
, ___, this Court held that a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [States] initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.  Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona, where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim during his first state collateral review proceeding.  Ibid.  This case regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on collateral review.  Rather, Texas law appears to permit a prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner to do so.  The question presented in this case is whether, despite this difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a life sentence.  Neither new counsel appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state collateral review raised the claim that Trevinos trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances.  When that claim was finally raised in Trevinos federal habeas petition, the District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in state court.  The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted because of Trevinos failure to raise it in his initial state postconviction proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this failure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the federal courts from considering the claim.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinezs good-cause exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must initially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to permit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.
			

				Held:Where, as here, a States procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception recognized in Martinez applies.  Pp.515.
			

				
				
				(a)A finding that a defendants state law procedural default rests on an independent and adequate state ground ordinarily prevents a federal habeas court from considering the defendants federal constitutional claim.  Coleman v. Thompson, 

501 U.S. 722
,729730.  However, a prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the federal law.  Martinez, supra, at ___.  In Martinez, the Court recognized a narrow exception to Colemans statement that an attorneys ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.  566 U.S., at ___.  That exception allows a federal habeas court to find cause to excuse such default where (1) the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim was a substantial claim; (2) the cause consisted of there being no counsel or only ineffective counsel during the state collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceeding was the initial review proceeding in respect to the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim; and (4) state law requires that the claim be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.  Id., at ___.  Pp.58.
			

				
				
				(b)The difference between the Texas lawwhich in theory grants permission to bring an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal but in practice denies a meaningful opportunity to do soand the Arizona law at issue in Martinezwhich required the claim to be raised in an initial collateral review proceedingdoes not matter in respect to the application of Martinez.  Pp.814.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)This conclusion is supported by two characteristics of Texas procedures.  First, Texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to be presented on direct review.  The nature of an ineffective-assistance claim means that the trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim.  And a motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate because of Texas rules regarding time limits on the filing, and the disposal, of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts.  Thus, a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts necessary for evaluating these claims in Texas.  Second, were Martinez not to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant unfairness because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on collateral, rath- er than on direct, review.  Texas can point to only a few cases in which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to expand the record on appeal.  Texas suggests that there are other mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal, but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application, and cannot overcome the Texas courts own well-supported determination that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  Respondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here, where appellate counsels failure to bring a substantial ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the procedural default, but respondent points to no case in which such a failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective.  Pp.813.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for applying that exception here.  The right involvedadequate assistance of trial counselis similarly and critically important.  In both instances practical considerationsthe need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claimargue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral, not on direct, review.  See Martinez, 566 U.S., at ___.  In both instances failure to consider a lawyers ineffectiveness during an initial-review collateral proceeding as a potential cause for excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  See id., at ___.  Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a State that grants permission but denies a fair, meaningful opportunity to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.  Pp.1314.

Martinez concerned a prisoner from Arizona, where state law required the prisoner to raise the claim during his first state collateral review proceeding. Texas law does not require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review and the Fifth Circuit subsequently held that Martinez was inapplicable to Texas cases. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded. Where, as here, state procedures make it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the Martinez exception applies.

Were Martinez not to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant unfairness. The Court noted Texas courts own well-supported determination that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Failure to consider a lawyers ineffectiveness during an initial-review collateral proceeding as a potential cause for excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.

				McQUIGGIN, WARDEN v. PERKINS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 12126.Argued February 25, 2013Decided May 28, 2013
			

				Rodney Henderson was found stabbed to death after leaving a party in Flint, Michigan, with respondent Floyd Perkins and Damarr Jones.  Perkins was charged with murder.  Jones, the key prosecution witness, testified that Perkins alone committed the murder while Jones looked on.  Perkins, however, testified that Jones and Henderson left him during the evening, and that he later saw Jones with blood on his clothing.  Perkins was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  His conviction became final in 1997.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  (AEDPA) gives a state prisoner one year to file a federal habeas petition, starting from the date on which the judgment became final.  

28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A).  But if the petition alleges newly discovered evidence, the filing deadline is one year from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim ... could have been discovered through ... due diligence.  2244(d)(1)(D).
			

				
				
				
				
				More than 11 years after his conviction became final, Perkins filed his federal habeas petition, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  To overcome AEDPAs time limitations, he asserted newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, relying on three affidavits, the most recent dated July 16, 2002, each pointing to Jones as the murderer.  The District Court found that, even if the affidavits could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPAs limitations period.  Alternatively, the court found, Perkins had not shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror would have convicted him.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  Acknowledging that Perkins petition was untimely and that he had not diligently pursued his rights, the court held that Perkins actual-innocence claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it had been filed on time.  In so ruling, the court apparently considered Perkins delay irrelevant to appraisal of his actual-innocence claim.  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup v. Delo, 

513 U.S. 298
, and House v. Bell, 

547 U.S. 518
, or expiration of the AEDPA statute of limitations, as in this case.  Pp.714.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Perkins, who waited nearly six years from the date of the 2002 affidavit to file his petition, maintains that an actual-innocence plea can overcome AEDPAs one-year limitations period.  This Courts decisions support his view.  The Court has not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding actual-innocence claim, Herrera v. Collins, 

506 U.S. 390
405, but it has recognized that a prisoner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence, id., at 404.  
			

				
				
				The Court has applied this fundamental miscarriage of justice exception to overcome various procedural defaults, including, as most relevant here, failure to observe state procedural rules, such as filing deadlines.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 

501 U.S. 722
.  The exception, the Courts decisions bear out, survived AEDPAs passage.  See, e.g., Calderon v. Thompson, 

523 U.S. 538
; House, 547 U.S., at 537538.  These decisions see[k] to balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.  Schlup, 513 U.S., at 324.  Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is AEDPAs statute of limitations.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The State urges that recognition of a miscarriage of justice exception would render 2244(d)(1)(D) superfluous.  That is not so, for AEDPAs time limitations apply to the typical case in which no actual-innocence claim is made, while the exception applies to a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted [the petitioner], Schlup, 513 U.S., at 329.  Many petitions that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be timely or not measured by 2244(d)(1)(D)s triggering provision.  Nor does Congress inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in 2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) indicate an intent to preclude courts from applying the exception in 2244(d)(1)(D) cases.  Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into 2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).  Rather, Congress constrained the exceptions application with respect to second-or-successive petitions and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court.  The more rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified version of the exception into other provisions of AEDPA is that, in a case not governed by those provisions, the exception survived AEDPAs passage intact and unrestricted.  Pp.914.
			

				
				
				2.A federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioners part, not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown.  A petitioner invoking the miscarriage of justice exception must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.  Schlup, 513 U.S., at 327.  Unexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing.  Taking account of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioners actual-innocence claim, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry, is tuned to the exceptions underlying rationale of ensuring that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.  Herrera, 506 U.S., at 404.  Pp.1416.
			

				
				
				3.Here, the District Courts appraisal of Perkins petition as insufficient to meet Schlups actual-innocence standard should be dispositive, absent cause, which this Court does not currently see, for the Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation.  Under Schlups demanding standard, the gateway should open only when a petition presents evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error.  513 U.S., at 316.  Pp.1617.
			

				670 F.3d 665, vacated and remanded.

The district court found that, even if the affidavits could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPAs limitations period, and, alternatively, that Perkins had not shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror would have convicted him.

				The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires state or local governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.  

47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(ii).  Relying on its broad authority to implement the Communications Act, see 

47 U.S.C. 201(b), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a Declaratory Ruling concluding that the phrase reasonable period of time is presumptively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications.  The cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, sought review of the Declaratory Ruling in the Fifth Circuit.  They argued that the Commission lacked authority to interpret 332(c)(7)(B)s limitations.  The Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent holding that Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

467 U.S. 837
, applies to an agencys interpretation of its own statutory jurisdiction, applied Chevron to that question.  Finding the statute ambiguous, it upheld as a permissible construction of the statute the FCCs view that 201(b)s broad grant of regulatory authority empowered it to administer 332(c)(7)(B).
			

				Held:Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agencys interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agencys statutory authority (i.e., its jurisdiction).  Pp.417.
			

				
				
				(a)Under Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if so, the court must give effect to Congress unambiguously expressed intent.  467 U.S., at 842843.  However, if the statute is silent or ambiguous, the court must defer to the administering agencys construction of the statute so long as it is permissible.  Id., at 843.  Pp.45.  
			

				
				
				(b)When a court reviews an agencys interpretation of a statute it administers, the question is always, simply, whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.  There is no distinction between an agencys jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional interpretations.  The jurisdictional-nonjurisdictional line is meaningful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decidethat is, to define their jurisdictionbut not to prescribe how they decide those cases.  But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes, both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.  Because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for carving out an arbitrary subset of jurisdictional questions from the Chevron framework.  See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 

534 U.S. 327
.  Pp.510.
			

				
				
				(c)This Court has consistently afforded Chevron deference to agencies constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 

478 U.S. 833
; United States v. Eurodif S.A., 

555 U.S. 305
.  Chevron applies to statutes designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion, see Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

470 U.S. 116
, and even where concerns about agency self-aggrandizement are at their apogeei.e., where an agencys expansive construction of the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental change in the regulatory scheme, see FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 

529 U.S. 120
.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(d)The contention that Chevron deference is not appropriate here because the FCC asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and local concern is meritless.  These cases have nothing to do with federalism: The statute explicitly supplants state authority, so the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will draw the lines to which the States must hew.  P.14.
			

				
				
				(e)United States v. Mead Corp., 

533 U.S. 218
, requires that, for Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted.  But Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency with rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking.  There is no case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agencys substantive field.  A general conferral of rulemaking authority validates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.  It suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.  Pp.1416.

			 The Communications Act of 1934 requires state or local governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed. 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling concluding that the phrase reasonable period of time is presumptively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications. The cities of Arlington and San Antonio challenged the Ruling. The Fifth Circuit found the statute ambiguous and upheld the FCCs determination that section 201(b)s broad grant of regulatory authority empowered it to administer section 332(c)(7)(B).  The Supreme Court affirmed. Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agencys interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agencys statutory authority (i.e., its jurisdiction).  The Court rejected a contention that Chevron deference was not appropriate because the FCC asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and local concern.

There is no case in which a general conferral of rule-making or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agencys substantive field. A general conferral of rule-making authority validates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering. It is sufficient that the preconditions to deference under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rule-making and adjudication, and the interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.

				SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES v. CLOER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 12236.Argued March 19, 2013Decided May 20, 2013
			

				The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) established a no-fault compensation system to stabilize the vaccine market and expedite compensation to injured parties.  Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. ___, ______.  Under the Act, [a] proceeding for compensation is initiated by service upon the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the filing of a petition containing specified documentation with the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims, who then immediately forwards the petition for assignment to a special master.  

42 U.S.C. 300aa11(a)(1).  An attorney may not charge a fee for services in connection with [such] a petition, 300aa15(e)(3), but a court may award attorneys fees and costs incurred [by a claimant] in any proceeding on an unsuccessful petition filed under section 300aa11, if that petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought, 300aa15(e)(1).
			

				
				
				
				
				In 1997, shortly after receiving her third Hepatitis-B vaccine, respondent Cloer began to experience symptoms that eventually led to a multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in 2003.  In 2004, she learned of a link between MS and the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in 2005, she filed a claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that the vaccine caused or exacerbated her MS.  After reviewing the petition and its supporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded that Cloers claim was untimely because the Acts 36-month limitations period began to run when she had her first MS symptoms in 1997.  The Federal Circuit ultimately agreed that Cloers petition was untimely.  Cloer then sought attorneys fees and costs (collectively, fees).  The en banc Federal Circuit found that she was entitled to recover fees on her untimely petition.  
			

				Held:An untimely NCVIA petition may qualify for an award of attorneys fees if it is filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis for its claim.  Pp.613.  
			

				
				
				(a)As in any statutory construction case, this Court proceeds from the understanding that [u]nless otherwise defined, statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.  BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 

549 U.S. 84
.  Nothing in either the NCVIAs attorneys fees provision, which ties eligibility to any proceeding on such petition and refers specifically to a petition filed under section 300aa11, or the referenced 300aa11 suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as its untimeliness, nullifies the initial filing.  As the term filed is commonly understood, an application is filed when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.  Artuz v. Bennett, 

531 U.S. 4
.  Applying this ordinary meaning to the text at issue, it is clear that an NCVIA petition delivered to the court clerk, forwarded for processing, and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a petition filed under section 300aa11.  So long as it was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of attorneys fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.  Had Congress intended otherwise, it could have easily limited fee awards to timely petitions.
			

				
				
				The Governments argument that the 36-month limitations period is a statutory prerequisite for filing lacks textual support.  First, there is no cross-reference to the Acts limitations provision in its fees provision, 300aa15(e), or the referenced 300aa11(a)(1).  Second, reading the provision to provide that no petition may be filed for compensation late, as the Government asks, would require the Court to conclude that a petition like Cloers, which was filed under that terms ordinary meaning but was later found to be untimely, was never filed at all.  This Courts inquiry ceases [where, as here,] the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 

534 U.S. 438
.
			

				
				
				The Governments contrary position is also inconsistent with the fees provisions purpose, which was to avoid limit[ing] petitioners ability to obtain qualified assistance by making awards available for non-prevailing, good-faith claims.  H.R. Rep. No. 99908, pt. 1, p.22.  Pp.610.
			

				
				
				(b)The Governments two additional lines of argument for barring the award of attorneys fees for untimely petitions are unpersuasive.  First, the canon of construction favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity, the presumption favoring the retention of familiar common-law principles, and the policy argument that the NCVIA should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly fees litigation must all give way when, as here, the statutes words are unambiguous.  Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 

503 U.S. 249
254.  Second, even if the NCVIAs plain text requires that special masters occasionally carry out shadow trials to determine whether late petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, that is not such an absurd burden as to require departure from the words of the Act.  This is especially true where Congress has specifically provided for such shadow trials by permitting the award of attorneys fees in any proceeding [on an unsuccessful] petition if such petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.  300aa15(e)(1).  Pp.1013.
			

				675 F.3d 1358, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined as to all but Part IIB.

				PPL CORP. etal. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 1243.Argued February 20, 2013Decided May 20, 2013
			

				In 1997, the United Kingdom (U.K.), newly under Labour Party rule, imposed a one-time windfall tax on 32 U.K. companies privatized between 1984 and 1996 by the Conservative government.  The companies had been sold to private parties through an initial sale of shares, known as a flotation.  Some of the companies were required to continue providing services for a fixed period at the same rates they had offered under government control.  Many of those companies became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in the process.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL), part owner of a privatized U.K. company subject to the windfall tax, claimed a credit for its share of the bill in its 1997 federal income-tax return, relying on Internal Revenue Code 901(b)(1), which states that any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid overseas are creditable against U.S. income taxes.  Treasury Regulation 1.9012(a)(1) interprets this section to mean that a foreign tax is creditable if its predominant character is that of an income tax in the U.S. sense.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected PPLs claim, but the Tax Court held that the U.K. windfall tax was creditable for U.S. tax purposes under 901.  The Third Circuit reversed.
			

				Held:The U. K. tax is creditable under 901.  Pp.414.
			

				
				
				(a)Treasury Regulation 1.9012, which codifies longstanding doctrine dating back to Biddle v. Commissioner, 

302 U.S. 573
579 (1938), provides the relevant legal standard.  First, a taxs predominant character, or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is controlling.  See id., at 579.  Thus, a foreign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess profits tax for most taxpayers is generally creditable.  Second, foreign tax creditability depends not on the way a foreign government characterizes its tax but on whether the tax, if enacted in the U.S., would be an income, war profits, or excess profits tax.  See 1.9012(a)(1)(ii).  Giving further form to these principles, 1.9012(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign taxs predominant character is that of a U.S. income tax [i]f ... the foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.  Three tests set forth in the regulations provide guidance in making this assessment, see 1.9012(b)(1).  The tests indicate that net gain consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts, in combination known as net income.  A foreign tax that reaches net income, or profits, is creditable.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)The U.K. windfall taxs predominant character is that of an excess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U.S. sense.  The Labour governments conception of profit-making value as a backward-looking analysis of historic profits is not a typical valuation method.  Rather, it is a tax on realized net income disguised as a tax on the difference between two values, one of which is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio.  The substance of the windfall tax confirms this conclusion.  When rearranged, the U.Ks formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference between the profits each company actually earned and the amount the Labour government believed it should have earned given its flotation value.  For most of the relevant companies, the U.K. formulas substantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits above a threshold, a classic excess profits tax.  The Commissioner claims that any algebraic rearrangement is improper because U.S. courts must take the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports to adopt.  But such a rigid construction cannot be squared with the black-letter principle that tax law deals in economic realities, not legal abstractions.  Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 

350 U.S. 308
.  Given the artificiality of the U.K.s calculation method, this Court follows substance over form and recognizes that the windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a threshold.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				(c)The Commissioners additional arguments in support of his position are similarly unpersuasive.  Pp.1114.
			

				665 F.3d 60, reversed.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.   Sotomayor, J., filed a concurring opinion.

				METRISH, WARDEN v. LANCASTER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 12547.Argued April 24, 2013Decided May 20, 2013
			

				On April 23, 1993, respondent Burt Lancaster, a former police officer with a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot and killed his girlfriend.  At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster asserted a defense of diminished capacity.  Under then-prevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, the diminished-capacity defense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of mental illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.  Apparently unpersuaded by Lancasters defense, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder and a related firearm offense.  Lancaster, however, later obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions.
				
				 
			

				
				
				
				
				By the time of Lancasters retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court had rejected the diminished-capacity defense in its 2001 decision in Carpenter.  Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged occurred several years before Carpenter was decided, the judge at his second trial applied Carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of his diminished-capacity defense.  Lancaster was again convicted.  Affirming, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Lancasters argument that the trial courts retroactive application of Carpenter vio- lated due process.
			

				
				
				Lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.  Concluding that the Michigan Supreme Courts 2001 rejection of the diminished-capacity defense was unforeseeable in April 1993, when Lancaster killed his girlfriend, the Sixth Circuit held that, by rejecting Lancasters due process claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.
			

				Held:Lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief.  Pp.415.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Lancaster may obtain federal habeas relief only if the Michigan Court of Appeals, in rejecting his due process claim, unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court.  

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  This standard is difficult to meet: Lancaster must show that the Michigan Court of Appeals decision rested on an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  To determine whether Lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard, the Court first considers two key decisions: Bouie v. City of Columbia, 

378 U.S. 347
, and Rogers v. Tennessee, 

532 U.S. 451
.  It then considers whether the Michigan Court of Appeals decision qualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions to Lancasters case.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(b)Bouie concerned African-American petitioners who had refused to leave a South Carolina drug stores whites-only restaurant area after entering without notice that the stores policy barred their entry.  They were convicted under a South Carolina trespass statute pro- hibiting entry upon the lands of another ... after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.  378 U.S., at 349350.  The South Carolina Supreme Court based its affirmance of the petitioners convictions on its prior decision in Mitchell, where the court held that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and the act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave.  378 U.S., at 350.

				METRISH, WARDEN v. LANCASTER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 12547.Argued April 24, 2013Decided May 20, 2013
			

				On April 23, 1993, respondent Burt Lancaster, a former police officer with a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot and killed his girlfriend.  At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster asserted a defense of diminished capacity.  Under then-prevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, the diminished-capacity defense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of mental illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.  Apparently unpersuaded by Lancasters defense, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder and a related firearm offense.  Lancaster, however, later obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions.
				
				 
			

				
				
				
				
				By the time of Lancasters retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court had rejected the diminished-capacity defense in its 2001 decision in Carpenter.  Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged occurred several years before Carpenter was decided, the judge at his second trial applied Carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of his diminished-capacity defense.  Lancaster was again convicted.  Affirming, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Lancasters argument that the trial courts retroactive application of Carpenter vio- lated due process.
			

				
				
				Lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.  Concluding that the Michigan Supreme Courts 2001 rejection of the diminished-capacity defense was unforeseeable in April 1993, when Lancaster killed his girlfriend, the Sixth Circuit held that, by rejecting Lancasters due process claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.
			

				Held:Lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief.  Pp.415.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Lancaster may obtain federal habeas relief only if the Michigan Court of Appeals, in rejecting his due process claim, unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court.  

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  This standard is difficult to meet: Lancaster must show that the Michigan Court of Appeals decision rested on an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___.  To determine whether Lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard, the Court first considers two key decisions: Bouie v. City of Columbia, 

378 U.S. 347
, and Rogers v. Tennessee, 

532 U.S. 451
.  It then considers whether the Michigan Court of Appeals decision qualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions to Lancasters case.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(b)Bouie concerned African-American petitioners who had refused to leave a South Carolina drug stores whites-only restaurant area after entering without notice that the stores policy barred their entry.  They were convicted under a South Carolina trespass statute pro- hibiting entry upon the lands of another ... after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.  378 U.S., at 349350.  The South Carolina Supreme Court based its affirmance of the petitioners convictions on its prior decision in Mitchell, where the court held that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and the act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave.  378 U.S., at 350.  Mitchell, however, was rendered 21 months after the petitioners arrest.  This Court held that the Due Process Clause prohibited Mitchells retroactive application to the Bouie petitioners, stressing that Mitchells interpretation of the state trespass statute was clearly at variance with the statutory language and ha[d] not the slightest support in prior South Carolina decisions.  378 U.S., at 356.

				No. 111518.Argued March 18, 2013
				
				Decided May 13, 2013
			

				Petitioners father established a trust for the benefit of petitioner and his siblings, and made petitioner the (nonprofessional) trustee.  The trusts sole asset was the fathers life insurance policy.  Petitioner borrowed funds from the trust three times; all borrowed funds were repaid with interest.  His siblings obtained a judgment against him in state court for breach of fiduciary duty, though the court found no apparent malicious motive.  The court imposed constructive trusts on certain of petitioners interestsincluding his interest in the original trustin order to secure petitioners payment of the judgment, with respondent serving as trustee for all of the trusts.  Petitioner filed for bankruptcy.  Respondent opposed discharge of petitioners state-court-imposed debts to the trust, and the Bankruptcy Court granted respondent summary judgment, holding that petitioners debts were not dischargeable pursuant to 

11 U.S.C. 523(a)(4), which provides that an individual cannot obtain a bankruptcy discharge from a debt for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.  The Federal District Court and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  The latter court reasoned that defalcation requires a known breach of fiduciary duty, such that the conduct can be characterized as objectively reckless.
			

				Held:The term defalcation in the Bankruptcy Code includes a culpable state of mind requirement involving knowledge of, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature of the fiduciary behavior.  Pp.49.
			

				
				
				(a)While defalcation has been an exception to discharge in a bankruptcy statute since 1867, legal authorities have long disagreed about its meaning.  Broad definitions of the term in modern and older dictionaries are unhelpful, and courts of appeals have disagreed about what mental state must accompany defalcations definition.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(b)In Neal v. Clark, 

95 U.S. 704
, this Court interpreted the term fraud in the Bankruptcy Codes exceptions to discharge to mean positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, as does embezzlement; and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.  Id., at 709.  The term defalcation should be treated similarly.  Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad faith, moral turpitude, or other immoral conduct, defalcation requires an intentional wrong.  An intentional wrong includes not only conduct that the fiduciary knows is improper but also reckless conduct of the kind that the criminal law often treats as the equivalent.  Where actual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, conduct is considered as equivalent if, as set forth in the Model Penal Code, the fiduciary consciously disregards, or is willfully blind to, a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his conduct will violate a fiduciary duty.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				(c)Several considerations support this interpretation.  First, statutory context strongly favors it.  The canon noscitur a sociis argues for interpreting defalcation as similar to its linguistic neighbors embezzlement, larceny, and fraud, which all require a showing of wrongful or felonious intent.  See, e.g., Neal, supra, at 709.  Second, the interpretation does not make the word identical to its statutory neighbors.  Embezzlement requires conversion, larceny requires taking and carrying away anothers property, and fraud typically requires a false statement or omission; while defalcation can encompass a breach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conversion, nor taking and carrying away anothers property, nor falsity.  Third, the interpretation is consistent with the longstanding principle that exceptions to discharge should be confined to those plainly expressed.  Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 

523 U.S. 57
.  It is also consistent with statutory exceptions to discharge that Congress normally confines to circumstances where strong, special policy considerations, such as the presence of fault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby benefiting, for example, a typically more honest creditor.  See, e.g., 

11 U.S.C. 523(a)(2)(A).  Fourth, some Circuits have interpreted the statute similarly for many years without administrative or other difficulties.  Finally, it is important to have a uniform interpretation of federal law, the choices are limited, and neither the parties nor the Government has presented strong considerations favoring a different interpretation.  Pp.79.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 11796.Argued February 19, 2013Decided May 13, 2013
			

				Respondent Monsanto invented and patented Roundup Ready soybean seeds, which contain a genetic alteration that allows them to survive exposure to the herbicide glyphosate.  It sells the seeds subject to a licensing agreement that permits farmers to plant the purchased seed in one, and only one, growing season.  Growers may consume or sell the resulting crops, but may not save any of the harvested soybeans for replanting.  Petitioner Bowman purchased Roundup Ready soybean seed for his first crop of each growing season from a company associated with Monsanto and followed the terms of the licensing agreement.  But to reduce costs for his riskier late-season planting, Bowman purchased soybeans intended for consumption from a grain elevator; planted them; treated the plants with glyphosate, killing all plants without the Roundup Ready trait; harvested the resulting soybeans that contained that trait; and saved some of these harvested seeds to use in his late-season planting the next season.  After discovering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement.  Bowman raised the defense of patent exhaustion, which gives the purchaser of a patented article, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or resell that article.  The District Court rejected Bowmans defense and the Federal Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holders permission.  Pp.410.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the patent exhaustion doctrine, the initial authorized sale of a patented article terminates all patent rights to that item, Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 

553 U.S. 617
, and confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use [or] sell the thing as he sees fit, United States v. Univis Lens Co., 

316 U.S. 241
250.  However, the doctrine restricts the patentees rights only as to the particular article sold, id., at 251; it leaves untouched the patentees ability to prevent a buyer from making new copies of the patented item.  By planting and harvesting Monsantos patented seeds, Bowman made additional copies of Monsantos patented invention, and his conduct thus falls outside the protections of patent exhaustion.  Were this otherwise, Monsantos patent would provide scant benefit.  After Monsanto sold its first seed, other seed companies could produce the patented seed to compete with Monsanto, and farmers would need to buy seed only once.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)Bowman argues that exhaustion should apply here because he is using seeds in the normal way farmers do, and thus allowing Monsanto to interfere with that use would create an impermissible exception to the exhaustion doctrine for patented seeds.  But it is really Bowman who is asking for an exception to the well-settled rule that exhaustion does not extend to the right to make new copies of the patented item.  If Bowman was granted that exception, patents on seeds would retain little value.  Further, applying the normal rule will allow farmers to make effective use of patented seeds.  Bowman, who purchased seeds intended for consumption, stands in a peculiarly poor position to argue that he cannot make effective use of his soybeans.  Bowman conceded that he knew of no other farmer who planted soybeans bought from a grain elevator.  In the more ordinary case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed from Monsanto or an affiliate, he will be able to plant it in accordance with Monsantos license to make one crop.  Pp.710.
			

				657 F.3d 1341, affirmed.

Bowman conceded that he knew of no other farmer who planted soybeans bought from a grain elevator.  In the more ordinary case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed from Monsanto or an affiliate, he will be able to plant it in accordance with Monsantos license to make one crop.  Pp.710.

			"|"
			Monsanto invented and patented Roundup Ready soybean seeds, which contain a genetic alteration that allows them to survive exposure to the herbicide glyphosate. It sells the seeds subject to a licensing agreement that permits farmers to plant the purchased seed in only one growing season. Growers may consume or sell the resulting crops, but may not save any of the harvested soybeans for replanting. Bowman purchased Roundup Ready soybean seed for his first crop of each growing season. To reduce costs for his riskier late-season planting, Bowman purchased soybeans intended for consumption; planted them; treated the plants with glyphosate, killing all plants without the Roundup Ready trait; harvested the resulting soybeans that contained that trait; and saved some of these harvested seeds to use in his late-season planting the next season. After discovering this practice, Monsanto sued for patent infringement. Bowman raised the defense of patent exhaustion, which gives the purchaser of a patented article, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or resell that article. The district court rejected Bowmans defense; the Federal Circuit affirmed.  In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court affirmed. Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without permission. Under the patent exhaustion doctrine, the initial authorized sale terminates all patent rights to the patented item and confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing, but the doctrine restricts the patentees rights only as to the particular article sold.  It leaves untouched the patentees ability to prevent a buyer from making new copies. By planting and harvesting patented seeds, Bowman made additional copies of Monsantos patented invention, which falls outside the protections of patent exhaustion. If Bowman were granted an exception, patents on seeds would retain little value.

				DANS CITY USED CARS, INC., dba DANS CITY AUTO BODY v. PELKEY
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of new hampshire
			

				No. 1252.Argued March 20, 2013Decided May 13, 2013
			

				The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) preempts state laws related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.  

49 U.S.C. 14501(c)(1).  This provision borrows from the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier, 41713(b)(1), but it adds the important qualification, with respect to transportation of property. 
			

				
				
				
				
				Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Superior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dans City Used Cars (Dans City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it from his landlords parking lot without Pelkeys knowledge, failed to notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkeys notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.  In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dans City did not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal of abandoned vehicles by a storage company.  Dans Citys misconduct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshires Consumer Protection Act and breached the towing companys statutory and common-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession of a bailors property.  The court granted summary judgment to Dans City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkeys claims.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed.  It held the FAAAAs preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkeys claims related to Dans Citys conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to conduct concerning the transportation of property, or a towing com- panys service.
			

				Held:Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle.  Pp.713.
			

				
				
				(a)Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute, this Courts task is to identify the domain expressly pre-empted, Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly,

.  In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 

552 U.S. 364
, this Courts reading of 14501(c)(1) was informed by decisions interpreting parallel language in the ADAs preemption clause.  Thus, the Court held, the phrase related to embraces state laws having a connection with or reference to carrier rates, routes, or services, whether directly or indirectly.  Ibid.  At the same time, the breadth of the words related to does not mean that the preemption clause should be read with an uncritical literalism.  New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,

				(b)Pelkeys state-law claims escape preemption because they are related to neither the transportation of property nor the service of a motor carrier.  Although 14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADAs air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulations one conspicuous alterationaddition of the words with respect to the transportation of propertysignificantly limits the FAAAAs preemptive scope.  It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the price, route, or service of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also concern a motor carriers transportation of property.  Title 49 defines transportation, in relevant part, as services related to th[e] movement of property, including arranging for ... storage [and] handling.  13102(23)(B).  Pelkeys Consumer Protection Act and negligence claims are not related to th[e] movement of his car.  Chapter 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportationhere, by towinghas ended.  Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored.  Dans City maintains that because 13102(23)(B)s definition of transportation includes storage and handling, Pelkeys claims fall within 14501(c)(1)s preemptive ambit.  But storage and handling fit within 13102(23)(B)s definition only when those services relat[e] to th[e] movement of property.  Thus temporary storage of an item in transit en route to its final destination qualifies as transportation, but permanent storage does not.  Here, no storage occurred in the course of transporting Pelkeys vehicle.
			

				
				
				Pelkeys claims are also unrelated to a service a motor carrier renders its customers.  The transportation service Dans City pro-videdremoval of Pelkeys car from his landlords parking lotdid involve the movement of property, but that service ended months before the conduct on which Pelkeys claims are based.  Because chapter 262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses storage compan[ies] and garage owner[s] or keeper[s], not transportation activities, it has neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services a motor carrier offers its customers.  See Rowe, 552 U.S., at 371.
			

				
				
				The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress purpose in enacting 14501(c)(1), which was to displace a States direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces in determining ... the services that motor carriers will provide.  Id., at 372.  The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a motor carrier to offer services not available in the market.  Nor do they freez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.  Ibid.  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				(c)Dans Citys additional arguments in favor of preemption are not persuasive.  Dans City contends that because none of Pelkeys claims fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U.S.C. 14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted.  But exceptions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in themselves delineate the scope of the rule.  Here, the exceptions identify matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so, but they do not control more than that.
			

				
				
				Dans City also maintains that Pelkeys claims are related to its towing service because selling Pelkeys car was the means by which Dans City obtained payment for the tow.  If such state-law claims were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute arising from a towing companys disposal of a vehicle previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.  No such design can be attributed to a rational Congress.  See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,

				No. 1217.Argued February 20, 2013Decided April 29, 2013
			

				Virginias Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-Virginians.  Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act.  After each petitioners request was denied, they filed a 

42 U.S.C. 1983 suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlberts case, the dormant Commerce Clause.  The District Court granted Virginias motion for summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Virginias FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are fundamental.  See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commn of Mont., 

436 U.S. 371
.  Pp.312.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)Hurlbert alleges that Virginias FOIA abridges his fundamental right to earn a living in his chosen professionobtaining property records on behalf of his clients.  While the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the right of citizens to ply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue a common calling, Hicklin v. Orbeck, 

437 U.S. 518
, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens.  See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 

334 U.S. 385
.  The Virginia FOIAs citizen/noncitizen distinction has a nonprotectionist aim.  Virginias FOIA exists to provide a mechanism for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public officials; noncitizens have no comparable need.  Moreover, the distinction between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth.  Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other States from making a profit by trading on information contained in state records is incidental.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Hurlbert also alleges that Virginias FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth.  The right to take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship.  See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.  However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining documents necessary to the transfer of property.  Recordslike title and mortgage documentsmaintained by the clerk of each circuit court are available to inspection by any person.  Real estate tax assessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought records.  Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerks office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA process, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to own or transfer property in Virginia.  Pp.68.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)McBurney alleges that Virginias FOIA impermissibly burdens his access to public proceedings.  The Privileges and Immunities Clause secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state, Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 

257 U.S. 533
, but that requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access ... upon terms which ... are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be ... the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens, Canadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, 

252 U.S. 553
.  Virginias FOIA clearly does not deprive noncitizens of reasonable and adequate access to Commonwealth courts.  Virginias court rules provide noncitizens access to nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to records pertaining directly to them.  For example, McBurney utilized Virginias Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA request.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(d)Petitioners sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the right to access public information on equal terms with Commonwealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public information is not a fundamental privilege or immunity of citizenship.  The Court has repeatedly stated that the Constitution does not guarantee the existence of FOIA laws.  See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 

528 U.S. 32
.  Moreover, no such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.  Nor is such a sweeping right basic to the maintenance or well-being of the Union.  Baldwin, supra, at 388.  Pp.1012.
			

				
				
				2.Virginias FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.  The common thread among this Courts dormant Commerce Clause cases is that the State interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome regulation.  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 

426 U.S. 794
.  Virginias FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.  Accordingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause case.  Even shoehorned into the Courts dormant Commerce Clause framework, however, Hurlberts claim would fail.  Insofar as there is a market for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.  A State does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a state program, it limits benefits generated by [that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.  Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 

447 U.S. 429

.  Virginias FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.  Accordingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause case.  Even shoehorned into the Courts dormant Commerce Clause framework, however, Hurlberts claim would fail.  Insofar as there is a market for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.  A State does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a state program, it limits benefits generated by [that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.

			Virginias Freedom of Information Act grants Virginia citizens access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-Virginians. Citizens of other states, including the owner of a business that obtains real estate tax records on behalf of clients, filed requests under the Act. After each was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. 1983 suit, alleging violations of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the dormant Commerce Clause. The district court granted Virginia summary judgment. The Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court affirmed. The Constitution does not guarantee the existence of FOIA laws. The Privileges and Immunities Clause protects only privileges and immunities that are fundamental. The Clause protects the right of citizens to ply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue a common calling, only with respect to laws enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens. Virginias FOIA exists to allow Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public officials; noncitizens have no comparable need. The distinction between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens pay fixed costs underlying record-keeping. The law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining documents necessary to the transfer of property or deprive noncitizens of reasonable and adequate access to Commonwealth courts. It gives noncitizens access to non-privileged litigation documents, to judicial records, and to records pertaining directly to them.  Virginias FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. It neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market; if there is a market for Virginias public documents, it is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.

				No. 11702.Argued October 10, 2012
				
				Decided April 23, 2013
			

				Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a noncitizen convicted of an aggravated felony is not only deportable, 

8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), but also ineligible for discretionary relief.  The INA lists as an aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, 1101(a)(43)(B), which, as relevant here, includes the conviction of an offense that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes punishable as a felony, i.e., by more than one years imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(2), 3559(a)(5).  A conviction under state law constitutes a felony punishable under the [CSA] only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.  Lopez v. Gonzales, 

549 U.S. 47
.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Moncrieffe, a Jamaican citizen here legally, was found by police to have 1.3 grams of marijuana in his car.  He pleaded guilty under Georgia law to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  The Federal Government sought to deport him, reasoning that his conviction was an aggravated felony because possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is a CSA offense, 

21 U.S.C. 841(a), punishable by up to five years imprisonment, 841(b)(1)(D).  An Immigration Judge ordered Moncrieffe removed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.  The Fifth Circuit denied Moncrieffes petition for review, rejecting his reliance on 841(b)(4), which makes marijuana distribution punishable as a misdemeanor if the offense involves a small amount for no remuneration, and holding that the felony provision, 841(b)(1)(D), provides the default punishment for his offense.
			

				Held:If a noncitizens conviction for a marijuana distribution offense fails to establish that the offense involved either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana, it is not an aggravated felony under the INA.  Pp.422.
			

				
				
				(a)Under the categorical approach generally employed to determine whether a state offense is comparable to an offense listed in the INA, see, e.g., Nijhawan v. Holder, 

557 U.S. 29
38, the noncitizens actual conduct is irrelevant.  Instead the state statute defining the crime of conviction is examined to see whether it fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.  Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 

549 U.S. 183
.  The state offense is a categorical match only if a conviction of that offense necessarily involved ... facts equating to [the] generic [federal offense].  Shepard v. United States, 

544 U.S. 13
.  Because this Court examines what the state conviction necessarily involved and not the facts underlying the case, it presumes that the conviction rested upon [nothing] more than the least of th[e] acts criminalized, before determining whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic federal offense.  Johnson v. United States, 

559 U.S. 133
.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)The categorical approach applies here because illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is a generic crim[e].  Nijhawan, 557 U.S., at 37.  Thus, a state drug offense must meet two conditions: It must necessarily proscribe conduct that is an offense under the CSA, and the CSA must necessarily prescribe felony punishment for that conduct.  Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is clearly a federal crime.  The question is whether Georgia law necessarily proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the CSA.  Title 

21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(D) provides that, with certain exceptions, a violation of the marijuana distribution statute is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 years.  However, one of those exceptions, 841(b)(4), provides that any person who violates [the statute] by distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration shall be treated as a simple drug possessor, i.e., as a misdemeanant.  These dovetailing provisions create two mutually exclusive categories of punishment for CSA marijuana distribution offenses: one a felony, the other not.  The fact of a conviction under Georgias statute, standing alone, does not reveal whether either remuneration or more than a small amount was involved, so Moncrieffes conviction could correspond to either the CSA felony or the CSA misdemeanor.  Thus, the conviction did not necessarily involve facts that correspond to an offense punishable as a felony under the CSA.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(c)The Governments contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  The Government contends that 841(b)(4) is irrelevant because it is merely a mitigating sentencing factor, not an element of the offense.  But that understanding is inconsistent with Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. ___, which recognized that when Congress has chosen to define the generic federal offense by reference to punishment, it may be necessary to take account of federal sentencing factors too.  The Government also asserts that any marijuana distribution conviction is presumptively a felony, but the CSA makes neither the felony nor the misdemeanor provision the default.  The Governments approach would lead to the absurd result that a conviction under a statute that punishes misdemeanor conduct only, such as 841(b)(4) itself, would nevertheless be a categorical aggravated felony.
			

				
				
				The Governments proposed remedy for this anomalythat noncitizens be given an opportunity during immigration proceedings to demonstrate that their predicate marijuana distribution convictions involved only a small amount of marijuana and no remunerationis inconsistent with both the INAs text and the categorical approach.  The Governments procedure would require the Nations overburdened immigration courts to conduct precisely the sort of post hoc investigation into the facts of predicate offenses long deemed undesirable, and would require uncounseled noncitizens to locate witnesses years after the fact.
			

				
				
				Finally, the Governments concerns about the consequences of this decision are exaggerated.  Escaping aggravated felony treatment does not mean escaping deportation, because any marijuana distribution offense will still render a noncitizen deportable as a controlled substances offender.  Having been found not to be an aggravated felon, the noncitizen may seek relief from removal such as asylum or cancellation of removal, but the Attorney General may, in his discretion, deny relief if he finds that the noncitizen is actually a more serious drug trafficker.  Pp.921.

			Moncrieffe, a Jamaican citizen legally in the U.S., was found with 1.3 grams of marijuana in his car. He pleaded guilty under Georgia law to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a noncitizen convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable, 8 U.S.C. 227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and ineligible for discretionary relief. The INA lists as an aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, including conviction of an offense that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes punishable as a felony (by more than one years imprisonment). A state conviction is a felony punishable under the CSA only if it involves conduct punishable as a felony under federal law. Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is a CSA offense, 21 U.S.C. 841(a), punishable by up to five years imprisonment. An Immigration Judge ordered Moncrieffe removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The Fifth Circuit denied a petition for review, rejecting reliance on section 841(b)(4), which makes marijuana distribution punishable as a misdemeanor if the offense involves a small amount for no remuneration. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. If a noncitizens conviction for marijuana distribution fails to establish that the offense involved either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana, it is not an aggravated felony under the INA. The Court employed the categorical approach, examining what the state conviction necessarily involved and not the facts underlying the case, and presuming that the conviction involved the least of the acts criminalized.  Conviction under Georgias statute, alone, does not reveal whether either remuneration or more than a small amount was involved, so Moncrieffes conviction could correspond to either the CSA felony or the CSA misdemeanor. The Court rejected an argument that section 841(b)(4) was merely a mitigating sentencing factor, not an element of the offense.  The governments proposal that noncitizens be allowed, during immigration proceedings, to demonstrate that their convictions involved only a small amount of marijuana and no remuneration is inconsistent with the INAs text and the categorical approach and would burden immigration courts and the noncitizens involved. Escaping aggravated felony treatment does not necessarily mean escaping deportation, because any marijuana distribution offense renders a noncitizen deportable as a controlled substances offender, but with an opportunity seek relief from removal.

				Petitioners, Nigerian nationals residing in the United States, filed suit in federal court under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging that respondentscertain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporationsaided and abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law of nations in Nigeria.  The ATS provides that [t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.  

28 U.S.C. 1350.  The District Court dismissed several of petitioners claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability.  This Court granted certiorari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS, for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.
			

				Held:The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.  Pp.314.
			

				
				
				(a)Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute that creates no causes of action.  It permits federal courts to recognize private claims [for a modest number of international law violations] under federal common law.  Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 

542 U.S. 692
.  In contending that a claim under the ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereigns territory, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial application, which provides that [w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none, Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. ___, ___.  The presumption serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.  EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 

499 U.S. 244
.  It is typically applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles similarly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be brought under the ATS.  Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this context, where the question is not what Congress has done but what courts may do.  These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only for alleged violations of international law norms that are specific, universal, and obligatory, 542 U.S., at 732.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purposes of the ATS.  Nothing in the ATSs text evinces a clear indication of extraterritorial reach.  Violations of the law of nations affecting aliens can occur either within or outside the United States.  And generic terms, like any in the phrase any civil action, do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.  See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at ___.  Petitioners also rely on the common-law transitory torts doctrine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has explained, the only justification for allowing a party to recover when the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place, Cuba R. Co. v. Crosby, 

222 U.S. 473
.  The question under Sosa is not whether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action provided by foreign or even international law.  The question is instead whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under U.S. law to enforce a norm of international law.  That question is not answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.
			

				
				
				The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also does not overcome the presumption.  When the ATS was passed, three principal offenses against the law of nations had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.  Sosa, supra, at 723, 724.  Prominent contemporary examples of the first two offensesimmediately before and after passage of the ATSprovide no support for the proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.  And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other country, applying U.S. law to pirates does not typically impose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign policy consequences.  A 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford regarding the conduct of U.S. citizens on both the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the ATSs extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforcement of international norms.  Pp.614.

			Nigerian nationals, having been granted asylum in the U.S., filed suit under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), alleging that Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations aided and abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law of nations in Nigeria. The complaint alleges that in the 1990s Nigerian government forces attacked villages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and destroying or looting property and that the corporations provided food, transportation, compensation, and a staging ground. The ATS provides that district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States, 28 U. S. C. 1350. On interlocutory appeal, the Second Circuit dismissed, holding that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability. The Supreme Court affirmed. The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to ATS claims. The danger of unwarranted judicial interference in foreign policy is magnified where the question is not what Congress has done but what courts may do. Nothing in the ATS indicates extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. The question is whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law.

				MISSOURI v. McNEELY
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
			

				No. 111425.Argued January 9, 2013Decided April 17, 2013
			

				Respondent McNeely was stopped by a Missouri police officer for speeding and crossing the centerline.  After declining to take a breath test to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC), he was arrested and taken to a nearby hospital for blood testing.  The officer never attempted to secure a search warrant.  McNeely refused to consent to the blood test, but the officer directed a lab technician to take a sample.  McNeelys BAC tested well above the legal limit, and he was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).  He moved to suppress the blood test result, arguing that taking his blood without a warrant violated his 
 
Fourth Amendment rights.  The trial court agreed, concluding that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because, apart from the fact that McNeelys blood alcohol was dissipating, no circumstances suggested that the officer faced an emergency.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, relying on Schmerber v. California, 

384 U.S. 757
, in which this Court upheld a DWI suspects warrantless blood test where the officer might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened the destruction of evidence, id., at 770.  This case, the state court found, involved a routine DWI investigation where no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood alcohol suggested that there was an emergency, and, thus, the nonconsensual warrantless test violated McNeelys right to be free from unreasonable searches of his person.
			

				Held:The judgment is affirmed.
			

				358 S.W. 3d 65, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Justice  Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, IIB, and IV, concluding that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.  Pp.413, 2023.
			

				
				
				(a)The principle that a warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if it falls within a recognized exception, see, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 

414 U.S. 218
, applies here, where the search involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath McNeelys skin and into his veins to obtain a blood sample to use as evidence in a criminal investigation.  One recognized exception applies when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable.  Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  This Court looks to the totality of circumstances in determining whether an exigency exits.  See Brigham City v. Stuart, 

547 U.S. 398
.  Applying this approach in Schmerber, the Court found a warrantless blood test reasonable after considering all of the facts and circumstances of that case and carefully basing its holding on those specific facts, including that alcohol levels decline after drinking stops and that testing was delayed while officers transported the injured suspect to the hospital and investigated the accident scene.  Pp.48.
			

				
				
				(b)The State nonetheless seeks a perse rule, contending that exigent circumstances necessarily exist when an officer has probable cause to believe a person has been driving under the influence of alcohol because BAC evidence is inherently evanescent.  Though a persons blood alcohol level declines until the alcohol is eliminated, it does not follow that the Court should depart from careful case-by-case assessment of exigency.  When officers in drunk-driving investigations can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sample drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the search, the 
 
Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so.  See McDonald v. United States, 

335 U.S. 451
.  Circumstances may make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the alcohols dissipation will support an exigency, but that is a reason to decide each case on its facts, as in Schmerber, not to accept the considerable overgeneralization that a perse rule would reflect, Richards v. Wisconsin, 

520 U.S. 385
.  Blood testing is different in critical respects from other destruction-of-evidence cases.  Unlike a situation where, e.g., a suspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see Cupp v. Murphy, 

412 U.S. 291
, BAC evidence naturally dissipates in a gradual and relatively predictable manner.  Moreover, because an officer must typically take a DWI suspect to a medical facility and obtain a trained medical professionals assistance before having a blood test conducted, some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether a warrant is obtained.  The States rule also fails to account for advances in the 47 years since Schmerber was decided that allow for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like drunk-driving investigations where the evidence supporting probable cause is simple.  The natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may support an exigency finding in a specific case, as it did in Schmerber, but it does not do so categorically.  Pp.813.
			

				
				
				(c)Because the State sought a per se rule here, it did not argue that there were exigent circumstances in this particular case.  The arguments and the record thus do not provide the Court with an adequate framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant.  It suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a warrant is required.  Pp.2023.
			

				
				
				Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Kagan, concluded in Part III that other arguments advanced by the State and amici in support of a perse rule are unpersuasive.  Their concern that a case-by-case approach to exigency will not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers may make the desire for a bright-line rule understandable, but the 
 
Fourth Amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical approach in this context.  A fact-intensive, totality of the circumstances, approach is hardly unique within this Courts 
 
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 

528 U.S. 119
125.  They also contend that the privacy interest implicated here is minimal.  But motorists diminished expectation of privacy does not diminish their privacy interest in preventing a government agent from piercing their skin.  And though a blood test conducted in a medical setting by trained personnel is less intrusive than other bodily invasions, this Court has never retreated from its recognition that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates significant, constitutionally protected privacy interests.  Finally, the governments general interest in combating drunk driving does not justify departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particular case.  Pp.1520.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. etal. v. SYMCZYK
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 111059.Argued December 3, 2012Decided April 16, 2013
			

				Respondent brought a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) on behalf of herself and other employees similarly situated.  

29 U.S.C. 216(b).  After she ignored petitioners offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, the District Court, finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that the Rule 68 offer fully satisfied her claim, concluded that respondents suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Third Circuit reversed.  It held that respondents individual claim was moot but that her collective action was not, explaining that allowing defendants to pick off named plaintiffs before certification with calculated Rule 68 offers would frustrate the goals of collective actions.  The case was remanded to the District Court to allow respondent to seek conditional certification, which, if successful, would relate back to the date of her complaint.
			

				Held:Because respondent had no personal interest in representing putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness, her suit was appropriately dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Pp.312.
			

				
				
				(a)While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer that fully satisfies a plaintiffs individual claim is sufficient to render that claim moot, respondent conceded the issue below and did not properly raise it here.  Thus, this Court assumes, without deciding, that petitioners offer mooted her individual claim.  Pp.35.
			

				
				
				(b)Well-settled mootness principles control the outcome of this case.  After respondents individual claim became moot, the suit became moot because she had no personal interest in representing others in the action.  To avoid that outcome, respondent relies on cases that arose in the context of Rule 23 class actions, but they are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are fundamentally different from FLSA collective actions and because the cases are inapplicable to the facts here.  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Neither Sosna v. Iowa, 

419 U.S. 393
, nor United States Parole Commn v. Geraghty, 

445 U.S. 388
, support respondents position.  Geraghty extended the principles of Sosnawhich held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiffs individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certifiedto denials of class certification motions; and it provided that, where an action would have acquired independent legal status but for the district courts erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling on appeal relates back to the time of the erroneous denial.  445 U.S., at 404, and n.11.  However, Geraghtys holding was explicitly limited to cases in which the named plaintiffs claim remains live at the time the district court denies class certification.  See id., at 407, n.11.  Here, respondent had not yet moved for conditional certification when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipatorily ruled on any such request.  She thus has no certification decision to which her claim could have related back.  More fundamentally, essential to Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified under Rule 23.  By contrast, under the FLSA, conditional certification does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or join additional parties to the action.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)A line of cases holding that an inherently transitory class-action claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the named plaintiffs claim, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 

500 U.S. 44
, is similarly inapplicable.  Respondent argues that a defendants use of Rule 68 offers to pick off a named plaintiff before the collective-action process is complete renders the action inherently transitory.  But this rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation to run its course, and it has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim, not on the defendants litigation strategy.  Unlike a claim for injunctive relief, a damages claim cannot evade review, nor can an offer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review.  Putative plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respondents suit, but they remain free to do so in their own suits.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Finally, Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 

445 U.S. 326
, does not support respondents claim that the purposes served by the FLSAs collective-action provisions would be frustrated by defendants use of Rule 68 to pick off named plaintiffs before the collective-action process has run its course.  In Roper, where the named plaintiffs individual claims became moot after the District Court denied their Rule 23 class certification motion and entered judgment in their favor based on defendants offer of judgment, this Court found that the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because they possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substantive controversy, namely, to shift a portion of attorneys fees and expenses to successful class litigants.  Here, respondent conceded that petitioners offer provided complete relief, and she asserted no continuing economic interest in shifting attorneys fees and costs.  Moreover, Roper was tethered to the unique significance of Rule 23 class certification decisions.  Pp.1011.
			

				656 F.3d 189, reversed.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

				US AIRWAYS, INC., in its capacity as fiduciary and plan administrator of the US AIRWAYS, INC. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLAN v. McCUTCHEN etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 111285.Argued November 27, 2012Decided April 16, 2013
			

				The health benefits plan established by petitioner US Airways paid $66,866 in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent McCutchen, a US Airways employee, in a car accident caused by a third party.  The plan entitled US Airways to reimbursement if McCutchen later recovered money from the third party.  McCutchens attorneys secured $110,000 in payments, and McCutchen received $66,000 after deducting the lawyers 40% contingency fee.  US Airways demanded reimbursement of the full $66,866 it had paid.  When McCutchen did not comply, US Airways filed suit under 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action to obtain ... appropriate equitable relief ... to enforce ... the terms of the plan.  McCutchen raised two defenses to US Airways request for an equitable lien on the $66,866 it demanded: that, absent over-recovery on his part, US Airways right to reimbursement did not kick in; and that US Airways had to contribute its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery, so any reimbursement had to be reduced by 40%, to cover the contingency fee.  Rejecting both arguments, the District Court granted summary judgment to US Airways.  The Third Circuit vacated.  Reasoning that traditional equitable doctrines and defenses applied to 502(a)(3) suits, it held that the principle of unjust enrichment overrode US Airways reimbursement clause because the clause would leave McCutchen with less than full payment for his medical bills and would give US Airways a windfall.

				The health benefits plan established by petitioner US Airways paid $66,866 in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent McCutchen, a US Airways employee, in a car accident caused by a third party.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				JOHN MARSHALL, WARDEN v. OTIS LEE RODGERS
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 12382.Decided April 1, 2013
			



				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state con- viction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  He claimed the state courts violated his 
 
Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap- point an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new trial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right to counseled representation.  The District Court denied respondents petition, and he appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas relief.  678 F.3d 1149, 1163 (2012).  Because the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that respondents claim is supported by clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, 

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.
			

				I
			

				
				
				In 2001, the State of California charged respondent with making criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and be- ing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.  Before his arraignment, respondent executed a valid waiver of his 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel, electing to represent himself.  See Faretta v. California, 

422 U.S. 806, 
807 (1975)
.  By the time of his preliminary hearing, however, respondent changed his mind and retained counsel.  Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again waived his right to counsel.  Two months after that, respondent again changed his mind and asked the court to appoint an attorney.  The court did so.  Shortly before trial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered his right to counsel.  He proceeded to trial prose.  On June 27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
			

				
				
				After the verdict was read, respondent asked the state trial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion for a new trial.  The trial judge deferred ruling on the motion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed the request in writing.  Neither the oral nor the written motion included reasons in support of his request; and when offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion at a later hearing, respondent declined to do so.  The trial court denied the request for counsel.  Respondents prose motion for a new trial was likewise denied.
			

				
				
				On direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondents convictions and sentence.  As relevant here, it concluded that his history of vacillating between counseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his motion, his demonstrated competence in defending his case, and his insistence that he c[ould] do the motion [him]self but just need[ed] time to perfect it, App. to Pet. for Cert. 129130, justified the trial courts denial of his post-trial request for counsel.  The state appellate court also distinguished its decision from that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Menefield v. Borg, 881 F.2d 696 (1989), reasoning that the habeas petitioner in Menefield had stated reasons justifying his request for counsel, whereas respondents request was unreasoned and unexplained.  The state appellate court concluded that [b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to grant [respondents] motion, we cannot find that the court abused its discretion in declining to do so.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 130.
			

				
				
				Having failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California courts had violated his 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel by not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial motion.  The District Court denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondents 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when the trial court denied his timely request for representation for a new trial motion.  678 F.3d, at 1163.
			

				
				
				To reach the conclusion that respondents right to counsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invoked certain 
 
Sixth Amendment precedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in other Circuits.  From those precedents, the panel identified two relevant principles that it deemed to have been clearly established by this Courts cases: first, that a defendants waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar his later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later critical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State that the reappointment request was made in bad faith, see id., at 11591162; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a critical stage, see id., at 11561159.  Combining these two propositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly established right to the reappointment of counsel for purposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California courtswhich vest the trial judge with discretion to approve or deny such requests based on the totality of the circumstances, see People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 147151, 38 P.3d 461, 493495 (2002)violated that right by refusing to order the reappointment of counsel.  678 F.3d, at 11621163.
			

				II
			

				
				
				The starting point for cases subject to 2254(d)(1) is to identify the clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States that governs the habeas petitioners claims.  See Williams v. Taylor, 

529 U.S. 362, 
412 (2000)
; Knowles v. Mirzayance, 

556 U.S. 111, 
122 (2009)
.  As indicated above, the parties here dispute whether two principles of law are clearly established under this framework.  One is whether, after a defendants valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under Faretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a critical stage of the prosecution.  For purposes of analysis here, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.
			

				
				
				The other disputed question is whether, after a defendants valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion to deny the defendants later request for reappointment of counsel.  In resolving this question in respondents favor, the Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that the Supreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal defendants ability to re-assert his right to counsel once he has validly waived it.  678 F.3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It then (also correctly) recognized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no clearly established federal law, since a general standard from this Courts cases can supply such law.  Yarborough v. Alvarado, 

541 U.S. 652, 
664 (2004)
.  The Court of Appeals erred, however, in its application of this latter proposition to the controlling issues here.
			

				
				
				It is beyond dispute that [t]he 
 
Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.  Iowa v. Tovar, 

541 U.S. 77
81 (2004); see United States v. Cronic, 

466 U.S. 648
654 (1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, 

372 U.S. 335, 
344 (1963)
.  It is just as well settled, however, that a defendant also has the right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.  Faretta, 422 U.S., at 807.
			

				
				
				There can be some tension in these two principles.  As the Faretta Court observed, [t]here can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Courts decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.  Id., at 832.  California has resolved this tension by adopting the framework under review.  Under that approach, trial judges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver requests for counsel; their decisions on such requests must be based on the totality of the circumstances, includ[ing] the quality of [the defendants] representation of [himself], the defendants prior proclivity to substitute counsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that] might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion.  Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P.3d, at 494 (quoting People v. Windham, 19 Cal. 3d 121, 128, 560 P.2d 1187, 11911192 (1977); final alteration in original).  The state appellate court applied those rules to the case at bar, concluding that the totality of the circumstancesand especially the shifting nature of respondents preferences, the unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated capacity to handle the incidents of trialsupported the trial courts decision.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 128131.
			

				
				
				The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that tension differently in its own direct-review cases.  It has adopted a strong presumption that a defendants post-trial request for the assistance of an attorney should not be refused, 678 F.3d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Ignacio, 360 F.3d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted), as well as a default rule that, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a defendants post-trial revocation of his waiver should be allowed unless the government can show that the request is made for a bad faith purpose, id., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F.2d, at 701; emphasis deleted).
			

				
				
				It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the 
 
Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver requests of appointment of counsel.  All this case requiresand all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under 2254(d)(1)is to observe that, in light of the tension between the 
 
Sixth Amendments guarantee of the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process, Tovar, supra, at 8081, and its concurrent promise of a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a criminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so, Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that Californias approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap- plication of the general standard[s] established by the Courts assistance-of-counsel cases.  Alvarado, supra, at 664.
			

				
				
				The Court of Appeals contrary conclusion rested in part on the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used to refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not announced.  Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (percuriam) (slip op., at 1213) (The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden [v. Wainwright, 

477 U.S. 168 (1986)
] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here); see 678 F.3d, at 1155, 1157.  The error in this approach is subtle, yet substantial.  Although an appellate panel may, in accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, look to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver v. Sheets, 594 F.3d 900, 916, n.6 (CA6 2010) (We are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established); Chambers v. McDaniel, 549 F.3d 1191, 1199 (CA9 2008), it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct.  See Parker, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1213); Renico v. Lett, 

559 U.S. 766
779 (2010).  The Court of Appeals failed to abide by that limitation here.  Its resulting holding was erroneous and must be reversed.
			

				III
			

				
				
				The Court expresses no view on the merits of the underlying 
 
Sixth Amendment principle the respondent urges.  And it does not suggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial.  This opinion is instead confined to the determination that the conclusion of the California courts that there was no 
 
Sixth Amendment violation is not contrary to clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  2254(d)(1).
			

				
				
				The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
			

				
It is so ordered.

				MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 1110362.Argued February 19, 2013Decided March 27, 2013
			

				The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Governments sovereign immunity from tort suits, but excepts from that waiver certain intentional torts, 

28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  Section 2680(h), in turn, contains a proviso that extends the waiver of immunity to claims for six intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the acts or omissions of an investigative or law enforcement officer i.e., a federal officer who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests.  Petitioner Millbrook, a federal prisoner, sued the United States under the FTCA, alleging, inter alia, assault and battery by correctional officers.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, and the Third Circuit affirmed, hewing to its precedent that the law enforcement proviso applies only to tortious conduct that occurs during the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.
			

				Held:The law enforcement proviso extends to law enforcement officers acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.  The provisos plain language supports this conclusion.  On its face, the proviso applies where a claim arises out of one of six intentional torts and is related to the acts or omissions of an investigative or law enforcement officer.  2680(h).  And by cross-referencing 1346(b), the proviso incorporates an additional requirement that the acts or omissions occur while the officer is acting within the scope of his office or employment.  1346(b)(1).

				MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
			

				No. 1110362.Argued February 19, 2013Decided March 27, 2013
			

				The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Governments sovereign immunity from tort suits, but excepts from that waiver certain intentional torts, 

28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  Section 2680(h), in turn, contains a proviso that extends the waiver of immunity to claims for six intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the acts or omissions of an investigative or law enforcement officer i.e., a federal officer who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests.  Petitioner Millbrook, a federal prisoner, sued the United States under the FTCA, alleging, inter alia, assault and battery by correctional officers.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, and the Third Circuit affirmed, hewing to its precedent that the law enforcement proviso applies only to tortious conduct that occurs during the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.
			

				Held:The law enforcement proviso extends to law enforcement officers acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.  The provisos plain language supports this conclusion.  On its face, the proviso applies where a claim arises out of one of six intentional torts and is related to the acts or omissions of an investigative or law enforcement officer.  2680(h).  And by cross-referencing 1346(b), the proviso incorporates an additional requirement that the acts or omissions occur while the officer is acting within the scope of his office or employment.  1346(b)(1).  Nothing in 2680(h)s text supports further limiting the proviso to conduct arising out of searches, seizures of evidence, or arrests.  The FTCAs only reference to those terms is in 2680(h)s definition of investigative or law enforcement officer, which focuses on the status of persons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that may give rise to a claim.

				No. 11864.Argued November 5, 2012Decided March 27, 2013
			

				Petitioners, Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, allegedly cluster their cable television operations within a particular region by swapping their systems outside the region for competitor systems inside the region.  Respondents, named plaintiffs in this class-action antitrust suit, claim that they and other Comcast subscribers in the Philadelphia cluster are harmed because Comcasts strategy lessens competition and leads to supra-competitive prices.  They sought class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which requires that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  The District Court required them to show (1) that the antitrust impact of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence common to the class and (2) that the damages were measurable on a classwide basis through a common methodology.  The court accepted only one of respondents four proposed theories of antitrust impact: that Comcasts actions lessened competition from overbuilders, i.e., companies that build competing networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates.  It then certified the class, finding that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated on a classwide basis, even though respondents expert acknowledged that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any one of respondents theories.  In affirming, the Third Circuit refused to consider petitioners argument that the model failed to attribute damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require reaching the merits of respondents claims at the class certification stage.
			

				Held:Respondents class action was improperly certified under Rule 23(b)(3).  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				(a)A party seeking to maintain a class action must be prepared to show that Rule 23(a)s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy-of-representation requirements have been met, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, ___, and must satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of Rule 23(b)s provisions.  The same analytical principles govern certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b).  Courts may have to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question, and [a] certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that [Rule 23s] prerequisites ... have been satisfied.  Ibid.  The analysis will frequently overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim because a class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action.  Ibid.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)The Third Circuit ran afoul of this Courts precedents when it refused to entertain arguments against respondents damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they would also be pertinent to the merits determination.  If they prevail, respondents would be entitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition.  A model that does not attempt to measure only those damages attributable to that theory cannot establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.  The lower courts contrary reasoning flatly contradicts this Courts cases, which require a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.  Wal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n.6.  Pp.68.

				DECKER, OREGON STATE FORESTER, etal. v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11338.Argued December 3, 2012Decided March 20, 2013
				[

				The Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the United States.  See 33 U.S.C. 1311(a), 1362(12).  One of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) implementing regulations, the Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges are point sources.  40 CFR 122.27(b)(1).  These discharges require NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision exempts them from coverage.  One such statutory provision exempts discharges composed entirely of stormwater, 

33 U.S.C. 1342(p)(1), unless the discharge is associated with industrial activ- ity, 1342(p)(2)(B).  Under the EPAs Industrial Stormwater Rule, the term associated with industrial activity covers only discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.  40 CFR 122.26(b)(14).  Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement applies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the Silvicultural Rule.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to harvest timber from a state forest.  When it rains, water runs off two logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams.  The discharges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms.  Respondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials, including petitioner Decker, invoking the Acts citizen-suit provision, 

33 U.S.C. 1365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Oregon rivers.  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required because the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that the conveyances were point sources under the Silvicultural Rule.  It also concluded that the discharges were associated with industrial activity under the Industrial Stormwater Rule, despite the EPAs contrary conclusion that the regulation excludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.  Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the NPDES permitting scheme.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions, 1369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit.  That provision is the exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency decisions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issuance of permits.  It does not bar a district court from entertaining a citizen suit under 1365 when the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regulations.  The present action falls within the scope of 1365.  Pp.89.
			

				
				
				2.The EPAs recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule does not make the cases moot.  A live controversy continues to exist regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  That version governed petitioners past discharges, which might be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those types of discharges will not require a permit.  These cases thus remain live and justiciable.  See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 

484 U.S. 49
65.  The fact that the District Court might rule that NEDCs arguments lack merit, or that relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the cases moot.  Pp.911.
			

				
				
				3.The preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule, as permissibly construed by the EPA, exempts discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES permitting scheme.  The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term associated with industrial activity, 1342(p)(2)(B), and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges at issue here.  When an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.  Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 

519 U.S. 452
).  Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that the conveyances at issue are directly related only to the harvesting of raw materials, rather than to manufacturing, processing, or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.  40 CFR 122.26(b)(14).  The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and other relatively fixed facilities.  
			

				
				
				Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPAs interpretation is that there is no indication that the agencys current view is a change from prior practice or is a posthoc justification adopted in response to litigation.  See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. ___, ___.  Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads.  In exercising the broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of Oregons extensive rules on the subject.  Pp.1115.

				The Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the United States.  See 33 U.S.C. 1311(a), 1362(12).  One of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) implementing regulations, the Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges are point sources.  40 CFR 122.27(b)(1).  These discharges require NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision exempts them from coverage.  One such statutory provision exempts discharges composed entirely of stormwater, 

33 U.S.C. 1342(p)(1), unless the discharge is associated with industrial activ- ity, 1342(p)(2)(B).  Under the EPAs Industrial Stormwater Rule, the term associated with industrial activity covers only discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.  40 CFR 122.26(b)(14).  Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement applies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the Silvicultural Rule.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to harvest timber from a state forest.  When it rains, water runs off two logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams.  The discharges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms.  Respondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials, including petitioner Decker, invoking the Acts citizen-suit provision, 

33 U.S.C. 1365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Oregon rivers.  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required because the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that the conveyances were point sources under the Silvicultural Rule.  It also concluded that the discharges were associated with industrial activity under the Industrial Stormwater Rule, despite the EPAs contrary conclusion that the regulation excludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.  Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the NPDES permitting scheme.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions, 1369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit.  That provision is the exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency decisions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issuance of permits.  It does not bar a district court from entertaining a citizen suit under 1365 when the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regulations.  The present action falls within the scope of 1365.  Pp.89.
			

				
				
				2.The EPAs recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule does not make the cases moot.  A live controversy continues to exist regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  That version governed petitioners past discharges, which might be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those types of discharges will not require a permit.  These cases thus remain live and justiciable.  See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 

484 U.S. 49
65.  The fact that the District Court might rule that NEDCs arguments lack merit, or that relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the cases moot.  Pp.911.
			

				
				
				3.The preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule, as permissibly construed by the EPA, exempts discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES permitting scheme.  The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term associated with industrial activity, 1342(p)(2)(B), and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges at issue here.  When an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.  Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 

519 U.S. 452
).  Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that the conveyances at issue are directly related only to the harvesting of raw materials, rather than to manufacturing, processing, or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.  40 CFR 122.26(b)(14).  The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and other relatively fixed facilities.  
			

				
				
				Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPAs interpretation is that there is no indication that the agencys current view is a change from prior practice or is a posthoc justification adopted in response to litigation.  See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. ___, ___.  Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads.  In exercising the broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of Oregons extensive rules on the subject.  Pp.1115.
			

				640 F.3d 1063, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined as to Parts I and II.

			The Clean Water Act requires that National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants are discharged from any point source into navigable waters of the United States, 33 U. S. C. 1311(a), 1362(12). An Environmental Protection Agency implementing regulation, the Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges are point sources, requiring NPDES permits unless some other provision exempts them. One exemption covers discharges composed entirely of stormwater, 33 U. S. C. 1342(p)(1), unless the discharge is associated with industrial activity.  Under the EPAs Industrial Stormwater Rule, the term associated with industrial activity covers only discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant. A final version of a recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule clarifies that the NPDES permit requirement applies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the Silvicultural Rule. Georgia-Pacific has a contract to harvest timber from an Oregon forest. When it rains, water runs off its logging roads into ditches that discharge the water into rivers and streams, often with sediment, which may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. NEDC sued Georgia-Pacific and state and local governments. The district court dismissed, concluding that NPDES permits were not required because the ditches were not point sources of pollution under the CWA and the Silvicultural Rule. The Ninth Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court reversed, first holding that section1369(b), did not bar the district court from hearing a citizen suit against an alleged violator and seeking to enforce an obligation imposed by the CWA. The recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule did not make the case moot. Past discharges might be the basis for penalties even if, in the future, those discharges will not require a permit. The pre-amendment Rule, as construed by the EPA, exempted discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES requirement. The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term associated with industrial activity; it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that the conveyances at issue are directly related only to harvesting raw materials, rather than to manufacturing, processing, or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant. The EPA has been consistent in its view that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.

				The federal Medicaid statutes anti-lien provision, 

42 U.S.C. 1396p(a)(1), pre-empts a States effort to take any portion of a Medicaid beneficiarys tort judgment or settlement not designated as payments for medical care, Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 

547 U.S. 268
.  A North Carolina statute requires that up to one-third of any damages recovered by a beneficiary for a tortious injury be paid to the State to reimburse it for payments it made for medical treatment on account of the injury.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent E.M.A. was born with multiple serious birth injuries that require her to receive between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing care per day and that will prevent her from being able to work, live independently, or provide for her basic needs.  North Carolinas Medicaid program pays part of the cost of her ongoing medical care.  E.M.A. and her parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the physician who delivered her and the hospital where she was born.  They presented expert testimony estimating their damages to exceed $42 million, but they ultimately settled for $2.8 million, due in large part to insurance policy limits.  The settlement did not allocate money among their various medical and nonmedical claims.  In approving the settlement, the state court placed one-third of the recovery into escrow pending a judicial determination of the amount of the lien owed by E.M.A. to the State.  E.M.A. and her parents then sought declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming that the States reimbursement scheme violated the Medicaid anti-lien provision.  While that litigation was pending, the North Carolina Supreme Court held in another case that the irrebuttable statutory one-third presumption was a reasonable method for determining the amount due the State for medical expenses.  The Federal District Court, in the instant case, agreed.  But the Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that the States statutory scheme could not be reconciled with Ahlborn.
			

				Held:The federal anti-lien provision pre-empts North Carolinas irrebuttable statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.  Pp.416.
			

				
				
				(a)In Ahlborn, the Court held that the federal Medicaid statute sets both a floor and a ceiling on a States potential share of a beneficiarys tort recovery.  Federal law requires an assignment to the State of the right to recover that portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care, but also precludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.  547 U.S., at 282, 284.  Ahlborn did not, however, resolve the question of how to determine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical care.  As North Carolina construes its statute, when the States Medicaid expenditures exceed one-third of a beneficiarys tort recovery, the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses, even if the settlement or verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical expenses.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)North Carolinas law is pre-empted insofar as it would permit the State to take a portion of a Medicaid beneficiarys tort judgment or settlement not designated for medical care.  It directly conflicts with the federal Medicaid statute and therefore must give way.  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  The state law has no process for determining what portion of a beneficiarys tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.  Instead, the State has picked an arbitrary percentage and by statutory command labeled that portion of a beneficiarys tort recovery as representing payment for medical care.  A State may not evade pre-emption through creative statutory interpretation or description, framing its law in a way that is at odds with the statutes intended operation and effect.  National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.S. ___, ___.  North Carolinas argument, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the context of tort recoveries.  It lacks any limiting principle: If a State could arbitrarily designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medical expenses, it could arbitrarily designate half or all of the recovery in the same way.  The State offers no evidence showing that its allocation is reasonable in the mine run of cases, and the law provides no mechanism for determining whether its allocation is reasonable in any particular case. 
			

				
				
				No estimate of an allocation will be necessary where there has been a judicial finding or approval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical damages.  In some cases, including Ahlborn, this binding stipulation or judgment will attribute to medical expenses less than one-third of the settlement.  Yet even in these circumstances, North Carolinas statute would permit the State to take one-third of the total recovery.  A conflict thus exists between North Carolinas law and the Medicaid anti-lien provision.
			

				
				
				This case is not as clear-cut as Ahlborn was, for here there was no such stipulation or judgment.  But Ahlborns reasoning and the federal statutes design contemplate that possibility: They envisioned that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary where a beneficiary and the State are unable to agree on what portion of a settlement represents compensation for medical expenses.  See 547 U.S., at 288.  North Carolinas irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid Acts clear mandate that a State may not demand any portion of a beneficiarys tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical ex-penses.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				(c)None of North Carolinas responses to this reasoning is persuasive.  Pp.1015.
			

				674 F.3d 290, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Roberts, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ.,joined.

				STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE CO. v. KNOWLES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
			

				No. 111450.Argued January 7, 2013Decided March 19, 2013
			

				The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) gives federal district courts original jurisdiction over class actions in which, among other things, the matter in controversy exceeds $5 million in sum or value, 28 U.S.C. 1332(d)(2), (5), and provides that to determine whether a matter exceeds that amount the claims of the individual class members must be aggregated, 1332(d)(6).  When respondent Knowles filed a proposed class action in Arkansas state court against petitioner Standard Fire Insurance Company, he stipulated that he and the class would seek less than $5 million in damages.  Pointing to CAFA, petitioner removed the case to the Federal District Court, but it remanded to the state court, concluding that the amount in controversy fell below the CAFA threshold in light of Knowles stipulation, even though it found that the amount would have fallen above the threshold absent the stipulation.  The Eighth Circuit declined to hear petitioners appeal.
			

				Held:Knowles stipulation does not defeat federal jurisdiction under CAFA. Pp. 37.
			

				
				
				(a)Here, the precertification stipulation can tie Knowles hands because stipulations are binding on the party who makes them, see Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U.S. ___.  However, the stipulation does not speak for those Knowles purports to represent, for a plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S. ___, ___.  Because Knowles lacked authority to concede the amount in controversy for absent class members, the District Court wrongly concluded that his stipulation could overcome its finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had been met.  Pp.34.
			

				
				
				(b)Knowles concedes that federal jurisdiction cannot be based on contingent future events.  Yet, because a stipulation must be binding and a named plaintiff cannot bind precertification class members, the amount he stipulated is in effect contingent.  CAFA does not forbid a federal court to consider the possibility that a nonbinding, amount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class certification process.  To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdictional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it were binding, exalt form over substance, and run counter to CAFAs objective: ensuring Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.  2(b)(2), 

119Stat.
5.
			

				
				
				It may be simpler for a federal district court to value the amount in controversy on the basis of a stipulation, but ignoring a nonbinding stipulation merely requires the federal judge to do what she must do in cases with no stipulation: aggregate the individual class members claims.  While individual plaintiffs may avoid removal to federal court by stipulating to amounts that fall below the federal jurisdictional threshold, the key characteristic of such stipulationsmissing hereis that they are legally binding on all plaintiffs.  Pp.47.
			

				Vacated and remanded.

				No. 11697.Argued October 29, 2012Decided March 19, 2013
			

				The exclusive rights that a copyright owner has to distribute copies ... of [a] copyrighted work, 

17 U.S.C. 106(3), are qualified by the application of several limitations set out in 107 through 122, including the first sale doctrine, which provides that the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title ... is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord, 109(a).  Importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owners permission is an infringement of 106(3).  See 602(a)(1).  In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. Lanza Research Intl, Inc., 

523 U.S. 135
, this Court held that 602(a)(1)s reference to 106(3) incorporates the 107 through 122 limitations, including 109s first sale doctrine.  However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the United States and then sent abroad and sold.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., an academic textbook publisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wileys English language textbooks abroad.  Wiley Asias books state that they are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edition English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States.  He then sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the profit.
			

				
				
				
				
				Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaengs unauthorized importation and resale of its books was an infringement of Wileys 106(3) exclusive right to distribute and 602s import prohibition.  Kirtsaeng replied that because his books were lawfully made and acquired legitimately, 109(a)s first sale doctrine permitted importation and resale without Wileys further permission.  The District Court held that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine does not apply to goods manufactured abroad.  The jury then found that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wileys American copyrights and assessed damages.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that 109(a)s lawfully made under this title language indicated that the first sale doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted works manufactured abroad.
			

				Held:The first sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.  Pp.733.
			

				
				
				(a) Wiley reads lawfully made under this title to impose a geographical limitation that prevents 109(a)s doctrine from applying to Wiley Asias books.  Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as imposing the non-geographical limitation made in accordance with or in compliance with the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owners permission.  Pp.78.
			

				
				
				(b)Section 109(a)s language, its context, and the first sale doctrines common-law history favor Kirtsaengs reading.  Pp.824.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Section 109(a) says nothing about geography.  Under can logically mean in accordance with.  And a nongeographical interpretation provides each word in the phrase lawfully made under this title with a distinct purpose: lawfully made suggests an effort to distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not, and under this title sets forth the standard of lawful[ness] (i.e., the U.S. Copyright Act).  This simple reading promotes the traditional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-word linguistic sense.  
			

				
				
				In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic difficulties.  Wiley first reads under to mean in conformance with the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.  Wiley then argues that the Act is applicable only in the United States.  However, neither under nor any other word in lawfully made under this title means where.  Nor can a geographical limitation be read into the word applicable.  The fact that the Act does not instantly protect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad.  Indeed, 602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies subject to the Copyright Act.  And 104 says that works subject to protection include unpublished works without regard to the [authors] nationality or domicile, and works first published in any of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the United States.  Pp.812.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate that Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the present version of 109(a).  A comparison of the language in 109(a)s predecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion.  The former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who lawfully obtained a copy, while the present version covers only owners of a lawfully made copy.  This new language, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of a copy will not receive first sale protection but one who owns a copy will be protected, provided that the copy was lawfully made.  A nongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions of the present statute.  For example, the manufacturing clause, which limited importation of many copies printed outside the United States, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies made in America and copies made abroad.  But that equal treatment principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpretation that would grant an American copyright holder permanent control over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed abroad but not those printed in America.  Finally, the Court normally presumes that the words lawfully made under this title carry the same meaning when they appear in different but related sections, and it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the consequences produced by a geographical interpretation.  Pp.1216.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of statutory interpretation that when a statute covers an issue previously governed by the common law, it is presumed that Congress intended to retain the substance of the common law.  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. ___, ___.  The common-law first sale doctrine, which has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical distinctions.  Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 

210 U.S. 339
, where this Court first applied the first sale doctrine, or in 109(a)s predecessor provision, which Congress enacted a year later.  Pp.1719.
			

				
				
				
				
				(4)Library associations, used-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways in which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic constitutional copyright objectives, in particular promot[ing] the Progress of Science and useful Arts, Art. I, 8, cl. 8.  For example, a geographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely require libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books in their collections that were printed overseas.  Wiley counters that such problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court first adopted a geographical interpretation.  But the law has not been settled for so long in Wileys favor.  The Second Circuit in this case was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation.  Reliance on the first sale doctrine is also deeply embedded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers, who have long relied on its protection.  And the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders to assert geographically based resale rights.  Thus, the practical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious, extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificantparticularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade to America.  Pp.1924.
			

				
				
				(c)Several additional arguments that Wiley and the dissent make in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.  Pp.2433.
			

				654 F.3d 210, reversed and remanded.

				No. 111351.Argued January 15, 2013Decided March 4, 2013
			

				The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Governments sovereign immunity from tort suits, 

28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), but excepts from the waiver certain intentional torts, including battery, 2680(h).  The FTCA, as originally enacted, afforded tort victims a remedy against the United States, but did not preclude suit against the alleged tortfeasor as sole or joint defendant.  Several agency-specific statutes postdating the FTCA, however, immunized certain federal employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of their official duties.  One such statute, the Gonzalez Act, makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel.  

10 U.S.C. 1089(a).  The Act also provides that, [f]or purposes of this section, the intentional tort exception to the FTCA shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical ... functions.  1089(e).  Congress subsequently enacted comprehensive legislation, the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act (Liability Reform Act), which makes the FTCAs remedy against the United States exclusive for torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment, 

28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(1).  Under the Liability Reform Act, federal employees are shielded without regard to agency affiliation or line of work.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Levin suffered injuries as a result of cataract surgery performed at a U.S. Naval Hospital.  He filed suit, naming the United States and the surgeon as defendants and asserting, inter alia, a claim of battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to operate shortly before the surgery took place.  Finding that the surgeon had acted within the scope of his employment, the District Court released him and substituted the United States as sole defendant.  The Government moved to dismiss the battery claim, relying on the FTCAs intentional tort exception.  Levin countered that the Gonzalez Act, in particular, 1089(e), renders that exception inapplicable when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by a military physician.  The District Court granted the Governments motion to dismiss.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit concluded that 1089(e) served only to buttress the immunity from personal liability granted military medical personnel in 1089(a), and did not negate the FTCAs intentional tort exception.
			

				Held:The Gonzalez Act direction in 1089(e) abrogates the FTCAs intentional tort exception and therefore permits Levins suit against the United States alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting within the scope of his employment.
				
				  Pp.815.
			

				
				
				(a)To determine whether the Governments immunity is waived for batteries, the Court looks to 1089(e)s language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.  Moskal v. United States, 

498 U.S. 103
.  Levin claims that the operative clause of 1089(e), which provides that the FTCAs intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical malpractice claims, is qualified by the provisions introductory clause [f]or purposes of this section, which confines the operative clause to claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies specified in the Gonzalez Act.  The Government, in contrast, argues that 1089(e)s introductory clause instructs courts to pretend, [f]or purposes of the Gonzalez Act, that 2680(h) does not secure the Government against liability for intentional torts, including battery, even though 2680(h) does provide that shelter.  The choice between the parties dueling constructions is not a difficult one.  Section 1089(e)s operative clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the FTCAs intentional tort exception, 2680(h), shall not apply, and 1089(e)s introductory clause confines the abrogation of 2680(h) to medical personnel employed by the agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act.  Had Congress wanted to adopt the Governments counterfactual interpretation, it could have used more precise language, as it did in 1089(c), a subsection adjacent to 1089(e).  Pp.811.
			

				
				
				(b)Under the Governments interpretation of 1089(e), the Liability Reform Act would displace much of the Gonzalez Act.  That reading conflicts with the view the Government stated in United States v. Smith, 

499 U.S. 160
.  There, the question was whether a person injured abroad due to a military doctors negligence may seek compensation from the doctor in a U.S. court, for the FTCA gave them no recourse against the Government on a claim arising in a foreign country, 

28 U.S.C. 2680(k).  In arguing that such persons also lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor, the Government contended that the Liability Reform Act made [t]he remedy against the United States under the FTCA exclusive.  2679(b)(1).  This interpretation, the Government argued, would not override the Gonzalez Act, which would continue to serve two important functions: Title 

10 U.S.C. 1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern; and the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United States if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did not consent.  Adopting the Governments construction, the Court held that 2679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical personnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even when the FTCA provides no remedy against the United States.  499 U.S., at 166.  Under the Governments current reading of 1089(e), the Liability Reform Act overrides the Gonzalez Act except in the atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under 1089(f)(1) remains possible, while under Levins reading, the Gonzalez Act does just what the Government said it did in Smith.  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government attempts to inject ambiguity into 1089(e) by claiming that 

38 U.S.C. 7316, a parallel statute that confers immunity on medical personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs, expresses Congress intent to abrogate 2680(h) with the unmistakable clarity the Gonzalez Act lacks.  But this Court sees nothing dispositively different about the wording of the two provisions, and neither did the Government when it argued in the District Court that 1089(e) and 7316(f) are functionally indistinguishable.  Pp.1314.
			

				663 F.3d 1059, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, which was unanimous except insofar as Scalia, J., did not join footnotes 6 and 7.

28 U.S.C. 2680(k).  In arguing that such persons also lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor, the Government contended that the Liability Reform Act made [t]he remedy against the United States under the FTCA exclusive.  2679(b)(1).  This interpretation, the Government argued, would not override the Gonzalez Act, which would continue to serve two important functions: Title 

10 U.S.C. 1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern; and the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United States if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did not consent.  Adopting the Governments construction, the Court held that 2679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical personnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even when the FTCA provides no remedy against the United States.  499 U.S., at 166.  Under the Governments current reading of 1089(e), the Liability Reform Act overrides the Gonzalez Act except in the atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under 1089(f)(1) remains possible, while under Levins reading, the Gonzalez Act does just what the Government said it did in Smith.  Pp.1113.
			

				
				
				(c)The Government attempts to inject ambiguity into 1089(e) by claiming that 

38 U.S.C. 7316, a parallel statute that confers immunity on medical personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs, expresses Congress intent to abrogate 2680(h) with the unmistakable clarity the Gonzalez Act lacks.  But this Court sees nothing dispositively different about the wording of the two provisions, and neither did the Government when it argued in the District Court that 1089(e) and 7316(f) are functionally indistinguishable.

			The Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity from tort suits, 28 U. S. C. 1346(b)(1), except for certain intentional torts, including battery; it originally afforded tort victims a remedy against the government, but did not preclude suit against the alleged tort-feasor. Agency-specific statutes postdating the FTCA immunized certain federal employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of official duties. The Gonzalez Act makes the FTCA remedy against the U.S. preclusive of suit against armed forces medical personnel, 10 U. S. C. 1089(a), and provides that, [f]or purposes of this section, the FTCA intentional tort exception shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical ... functions.  Congress subsequently enacted the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act, which makes the FTCA remedy against the government exclusive for torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment, 28 U. S. C. 2679(b)(1); federal employees are shielded without regard to agency or line of work.  Levin, injured as a result of surgery performed at a U. S. Naval Hospital, sued the government and the surgeon, asserting battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent shortly before the surgery. Finding that the surgeon had acted within the scope of his employment, the district court released him and dismissed the battery claim. Affirming, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Gonzalez Act served only to buttress the personal immunity granted military medical personnel and did not negate the FTCA intentional tort exception. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. The Gonzalez Act section 1089(e) abrogates the FTCA intentional tort exception, allowing Levins suit against the U.S.  alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting within the scope of employment. The operative clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the FTCA intentional tort exception shall not apply, and confines the abrogation to medical personnel employed by listed agencies.

				AMGEN INC. etal. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 111085.Argued November 5, 2012Decided February 27, 2013
			

				To recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5, a plaintiff must prove, among other things, reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the defendant.  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  Requiring proof of direct reliance would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on [a] plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.  Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 

485 U.S. 224
.  Thus, this Court has endorsed a fraud-on-the-market theory, which permits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities traded in an efficient market.  Id., at 241249.  The fraud-on-the-market theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class actions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.
			

				
				
				
				
				Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc. and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen).  The District Court certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Ninth Circuit rejected Amgens argument that Connecticut Retirement was required to prove the materiality of Amgens alleged misrepresentations and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)s requirement that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had presented on the issue of materiality at the class-certification stage.  
			

				Held:Proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a securities-fraud class action seeking money damages for alleged violations of 10(b) and Rule 10b5.  Pp.926.
			

				
				
				(a)The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will predominate over any questions affecting only individual members as the litigation progresses.  For two reasons, the answer to this question is no.  First, because materiality is judged according to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence common to the class.  TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 

426 U.S. 438
.  Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.  Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality would not result in individual questions predominating.  Instead, it would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a securities-fraud claim.  Pp.914.
			

				
				
				(b)Amgens arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Pp.1424.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Amgen points to the Courts statement in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. ___, ___, that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basics rebuttable presumption of reliance, including that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known ... , that the stock traded in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.  If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materialityanother fraud-on-the-market predicateshould be treated no differently.  The Court disagrees.  The requirement that a putative class representative establish that it executed trades between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry.  And unlike materiality, market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispensable elements of a Rule 105 claim.  While the failure of common, classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.  Pp.1518.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Amgen also contends that policy considerations militate in favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality.  Because class certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at the class-certification stage.  In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b5 claim, notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which the plaintiffs claims are based were false or misleading and that the alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss.  Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory.  And contrary to Amgens argument that requiring proof of materiality before class certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgens position would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materiality at the class-certification stage.  Pp.1822.
			

				
				
				(c)Also unavailing is Amgens claim that the District Court erred by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in opposing Connecticut Retirements class-certification motion.  The Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgens rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirements complaint were immaterial.  The potential immateriality of Amgens alleged misrepresentations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common questions predominate.  Just as a plaintiff classs inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.  Pp. 2426.

				GABELLI etal. v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 111274.Argued January 8, 2013Decided February 27, 2013
			

				The Investment Advisers Act makes it illegal for investment advisers to defraud their clients, 15 U.S.C. 80b6(1), (2), and authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions against investment advisers who violate the Act, or against individuals who aid and abet such violations, 80b9(d).  If the SEC seeks civil penalties as part of those actions, it must file suit within five years from the date when the claim first accrued, pursuant to a general statute of limitations that governs many penalty provisions throughout the U.S. Code, 

28 U.S.C. 2462.
			

				
				
				
				
				In 2008, the SEC sought civil penalties from petitioners Alpert and Gabelli.  The complaint alleged that they aided and abetted investment adviser fraud from 1999 until 2002.  Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing in part that the civil penalty claim was untimely.  Invoking the five-year statute of limitations in 2462, they pointed out that the complaint alleged illegal activity up until August 2002 but was not filed until April 2008.  The District Court agreed and dismissed the civil penalty claim as time barred.  The Second Circuit reversed, accepting the SECs argument that because the underlying violations sounded in fraud, the discovery rule applied, meaning that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the SEC discovered or reasonably could have discovered the fraud.
			

				Held:The five-year clock in 2462 begins to tick when the fraud occurs, not when it is discovered.  Pp.411.
			

				
				
				(a)This is the most natural reading of the statute.  In common parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence.  United States v. Lindsay, 

346 U.S. 568
.  The standard rule is that a claim accrues when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.  Wallace v. Kato, 

549 U.S. 384
.  Such an understanding appears in cases and dictionaries from the 19th century, when the predecessor to 2462 was enacted.  And this reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts ends, advancing the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose, elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiffs opportunity for recovery and a defendants potential liabilities.  Rotella v. Wood, 

528 U.S. 549
.  Pp.45.
			

				
				
				(b)The Government nonetheless argues that the discovery rule should apply here.  That doctrine is an exception to the standard rule, and delays accrual until a plaintiff has discovered his cause of action.  Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  It arose from the recognition that something different was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendants deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.  Ibid.  Thus where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.  Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 

327 U.S. 392
.  This Court, however, has never applied the discovery rule in this context, where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is instead the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.  The Governments case is not saved by Exploration Co. v. United States, 

247 U.S. 435
.  There, the discovery rule was applied in favor of the Government, but the Government was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss.  It was not bringing an enforcement action for penalties.
			

				
				
				There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been extended to Government civil penalty enforcement actions.  The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have no reason to suspect fraud.  The Government is a different kind of plaintiff.  The SECs very purpose, for example, is to root out fraud, and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit.  The Government in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.  The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers.  Emphasizing the importance of time limits on penalty actions, Chief Justice Marshall admonished that it would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws if actions for penalties could be brought at any distance of time.  Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342.  Yet grafting the discovery rule onto 2462 would raise similar concerns.  It would leave defendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into the future.  And repose would hinge on speculation about what the Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known it.  Deciding when the Government knew or reasonably should have known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the courts, such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing Government knowledge, whether and how to consider agency priorities and resource constraints in deciding when the Government reasonably should have known of a fraud, and so on.  Applying a discovery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and the Court declines to do so.  Pp.511.

If the SEC seeks civil penalties, it must file suit within five years from the date when the claim first accrued, 28 U. S. C. 2462. In 2008 the SEC sought civil penalties, alleging that individuals aided and abetted investment adviser fraud from 1999 until 2002. The district court dismissed the claim as time barred. The Second Circuit reversed, reasoning that the underlying violations sounded in fraud, so the discovery rule applied, and the limitations period did not begin to run until the SEC discovered or reasonably could have discovered the fraud. The Supreme Court reversed. The limitation period begins to run when the fraud occurs, not when it is discovered.  In common parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence. The discovery rule is an exception to the standard rule and has never been applied where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is the government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties. The government is a different kind of plaintiff. The SECs very purpose is to root out fraud. The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation and are intended to punish. Deciding when the government knew or reasonably should have known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the courts.

				Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), 

50 U.S.C. 1881a, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.  Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts (FISC) approval.  Surveillance under 1881a is subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervision, and compliance with the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Respondentsattorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizationsare United States persons who claim that they engage in sensitive international communications with individuals who they believe are likely targets of 1881a surveillance.  On the day that the FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they filed suit, seeking a declaration that 1881a is facially unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against 1881a-authorized surveillance.  The District Court found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that respondents showed (1) an objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications will be intercepted at some time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries resulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect the confidentiality of their international communications from possible 1881a surveillance.  
			

				Held:Respondents do not have Article III standing.  Pp.824.
			

				
				
				(a)To establish Article III standing, an injury must be concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. ___, ___.  [T]hreatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and [a]llegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 

495 U.S. 149
.  Pp.810.
			

				
				
				(b)Respondents assert that they have suffered injury in fact that is fairly traceable to 1881a because there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will be intercepted under 1881a at some point.  This argument fails.  Initially, the Second Circuits objectively reasonable likelihood standard is inconsistent with this Courts threatened injury requirement.  Respondents standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of possibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to 1881a.  First, it is highly speculative whether the Government will imminently target communications to which respondents are parties.  Since respondents, as U.S. persons, cannot be targeted under 1881a, their theory necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be targeted.  Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Governments 1881a targeting practices.  Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to use 1881aauthorized surveillance instead of one of the Governments numerous other surveillance methods, which are not challenged here.  Third, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek FISC authorization to target respondents foreign contacts under 1881a, they can only speculate as to whether the FISC will authorize the surveillance.  This Court is reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.  See, e.g., Whitmore, supra, at 159160.  Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the FISCs approval to target respondents foreign contacts under 1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in acquiring those contacts communications.  And fifth, even if the Government were to target respondents foreign contacts, respondents can only speculate as to whether their own communications with those contacts would be incidentally acquired.  Pp.1015.
			

				
				
				(c)Respondents alternative argument is also unpersuasive.  They claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to 1881a because the risk of 1881a surveillance requires them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of their communications.  But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.  Because they do not face a threat of certainly impending interception under 1881a, their costs are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insufficient to create standing.  See Laird v. Tatum, 

408 U.S. 1
15.  Accordingly, any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to 1881a.  Pp.1620.
			

				
				
				(d)Respondents remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.  Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds of injuries that supported standing in cases such as Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 

528 U.S. 167
, Meese v. Keene, 

481 U.S. 465
, and Monsanto, supra.  And their suggestion that they should be held to have standing because otherwise the constitutionality of 1881a will never be adjudicated is both legally and factually incorrect.  First, [t]he assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.  Valley Forge Christian College v.

				MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
			

				No. 111175.Argued November 7, 2012Decided February 26, 2013
			

				Petitioner Marx filed suit, alleging that General Revenue Corporation (GRC) violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by harassing and falsely threatening her in order to collect on a debt.  The District Court ruled against Marx and awarded GRC costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 54(d)(1), which gives district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants [u]nless a federal statute ... provides otherwise.  Marx sought to vacate the award, arguing that the courts discretion under Rule 54(d)(1) was displaced by 

15 U.S.C. 1692k(a)(3), which provides, in pertinent part, that [o]n a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorneys fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.  The District Court rejected Marxs argument.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed, in pertinent part, agreeing that costs are allowed under the Rule and concluding that nothing in the statutes text, history, or purpose indicates that it was meant to displace the Rule.
			

				Held:Section 1692k(a)(3) is not contrary to, and, thus, does not displace a district courts discretion to award costs under, Rule 54(d)(1).  Pp.416.
			

				
				
				(a)Rule 54(d)(1) gives courts discretion to award costs to prevailing parties, but this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or FRCP that provides otherwise, i.e., is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1).  Contrary to the argument of Marx and the United States, as amicus, language of the original 1937 version of the Rule does not suggest that any express provision for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1), regardless of whether it is contrary to the Rule.  Pp.47.
			

				
				
				(b)Section 1692k(a)(3)s language and context demonstrate that the provision is not contrary to Rule 54(d)(1).  Pp.715.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)GRC argues that since 1692k(a)(3) does not address whether costs may be awarded in an FDCPA case brought in good faith, it does not set forth a standard that is contrary to the Rule and therefore does not displace the presumption that a court has discretion to award costs.  Marx and the United States concede that the statute does not expressly limit a courts discretion to award costs under the Rule, but argue that it does so by negative implication.  They claim that unless 1692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which to award costs, the phrase and costs would be superfluous with Rule 54(d)(1).  And the United States also argues that 1692k(a)(3)s more specific cost statute displaces Rule 54(d)(1)s more general rule.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The argument of Marx and the United States depends critically on whether 1692k(a)(3)s allowance of costs creates a negative implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.  The expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it, Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 

537 U.S. 149
, and can be overcome by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion, United States v. Vonn, 

535 U.S. 55
.  Here, context indicates that Congress did not intend 1692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from awarding costs under the Rule.  First, under the American Rule, each litigant generally pays his own attorneys fees, but the Court has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award attorneys fees in a narrow set of circumstances, e.g., when a party brings an action in bad faith.  The statute is thus best read as codifying a courts pre-existing authority to award both attorneys fees and costs.  Next, 1692k(a)(3)s second sentence must be understood in light of its first, which provides an award of attorneys fees and costs, but to prevailing plaintiffs.  By adding and costs to the second sentence, Congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only recover attorneys fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorneys fees in such cases.  Finally, 1692k(a)(3)s language sharply contrasts with that of other statutes in which Congress has placed conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants.  See, e.g., 

28 U.S.C. 1928.  Pp.912.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct, the canon against surplusage is not absolute.  First, the canon assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.  Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  Here, no interpretation of 1692k(a)(3) gives effect to every word.  Second, redundancy is not unusual in statutes addressing costs.  See, e.g., 

12 U.S.C. 2607(d)(5).  Finally, the canon is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.  Because 1692k(a)(3) is not part of Rule 54(d)(1), the force of this canon is diminished.  Pp.1314.
			

				
				
				
				
				(4)Lastly, contrary to the United States claim that specific cost-shifting standards displace general ones, the context of the statute indicates that Congress was simply confirming the background presumption that courts may award to defendants attorneys fees and costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith.  Because Marx did not bring this suit in bad faith, the specific provision is not applicable.  Pp.1415.
			

				668 F.3d 1174, affirmed.

				GUNN etal. v. MINTON
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of texas
			

				No. 111118.Argued January 16, 2013Decided February 20, 2013
			

				Petitioner attorneys represented respondent Minton in a federal patent infringement suit.  The District Court declared Mintons patent invalid under the on sale bar since he had leased his interactive securities trading system to a securities brokerage more than one year prior to the date of the [patent] application.  

35 U.S.C. 102(b).  In a motion for reconsideration, Minton argued for the first time that the lease was part of ongoing testing, and therefore fell within the experimental use exception to the on-sale bar.  The District Court denied the motion and the Federal Circuit affirmed, concluding that the District Court had appropriately held that argument waived.  Convinced that his attorneys failure to timely raise the argument cost him the lawsuit and led to the invalidation of his patent, Minton brought a legal malpractice action in Texas state court.  His former attorneys argued that Mintons infringement claims would have failed even if the experimental-use argument had been timely raised, and the trial court agreed.  On appeal, Minton claimed that the federal district courts had exclusive jurisdiction over claims like his under 

28 U.S.C. 1338(a), which provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over any case arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.  Minton argued that the state trial court had therefore lacked jurisdiction, and he should be able to start over with his malpractice suit in federal court.  Applying the test of Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 

545 U.S. 308
, the Texas Court of Appeals rejected Mintons argument, proceeded to the merits, and determined that Minton had failed to establish experimental use.  The Texas Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the case properly belonged in federal court because the success of Mintons malpractice claim relied upon a question of federal patent law.

				EVANS v. MICHIGAN
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of michigan
			

				No. 111327.Argued November 6, 2012Decided February 20, 2013
			

				After the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner Evans arson trial, the court granted Evans motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, concluding that the State had failed to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling, a fact the court mistakenly believed was an element of the statutory offense.  The State Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for retrial.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.
			

				Held:The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial for Evans offense.  Pp.417.
			

				
				
				(a)Retrial following a court-decreed acquittal is barred, even if the acquittal is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation, Fong Foo v. United States, 

369 U.S. 141
, such as an erroneous decision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, 

437 U.S. 54
69; a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction, Smith v. Massachusetts, 

543 U.S. 462
; or a misconstruction of the statute defining the requirements to convict, Arizona v. Rumsey, 

467 U.S. 303
.  Most relevant here, an acquittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecutions proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.  See, e.g., United States v. Scott, 

437 U.S. 82
; Burks v. United States, 

437 U.S. 1
.  In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns.  Scott, 437 U.S., at 91.  Here, the trial court clearly evaluated the [States] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.  United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 

430 U.S. 564
.  Evans acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the determination to acquit, not its essential character.  See Scott, 437 U.S., at 98.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)The State Supreme Court attempted to distinguish this Courts cases on the ground that they involved the sufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense, while Evans case concerned an error of law unrelated to [his] guilt or innocence, but this Court perceives no such difference.  This case, like the Courts previous ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.  The State and the United States claim that only when an actual element of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the offense, but Evans verdict was based on something that was concededly not an element.  Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly and is inconsistent with this Courts decisions since then.  Martin Linen focused on the significance of the District Courts acquittal based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not depend on defining the elements of the offense.  Culpability is the touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct.  Scott, 437 U.S., at 98.  Pp.711.
			

				
				
				(c)Additional arguments the State and the United States raise in support of the lower courts distinction are unpersuasive.  The State claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to know whether the courts ruling was an acquittal is to rely upon the courts label, which would wrongly allow the form of the trial courts action to control.  However, the instant decision turns not on the form of the trial courts action but on whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes.  The State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at all.  But this Court presumes that courts exercise their duties in good faith.  The State also suggests that Evans should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he induced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most midtrial acquittals result from defense motions.  The United States claims that, under Lee v. United States, 

432 U.S. 23
, Evans was required to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an element of the offense before jeopardy attached.  However, Lee involved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the States proof.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				(d)This Court declines to revisit decisions such as Fong Foo, Smith, Rumsey, and Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 

476 U.S. 140
.  There is no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so unworkable as to justify overruling precedent.  Payne v. Tennessee, 

501 U.S. 808
.  And the logic of those cases still holds.  As for the objection that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a windfall from the trial courts unreviewable error, sovereigns have power to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial acquittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to acquit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.  Pp.1416.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				Syllabus
			

				JOHNSON, ACTING WARDEN v. WILLIAMS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11465.Argued October 3, 2012Decided February 20, 2013
			

				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) provides that a federal habeas court may not grant relief to a state prisoner whose claim has already been adjudicated on the merits in State court, 

28 U.S.C. 2254(d), unless the claims adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court, 2254(d)(1), or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(d)(2).
			

				
				
				
				
				A California jury convicted respondent Williams of first-degree murder.  On direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal, she claimed that the trial courts questioning and dismissal of a juror during deliberations violated both the 
 
Sixth Amendment and California law.  In holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted the definition of impartiality from United States v. Wood, 

299 U.S. 123
146, but it did not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a 
 
Sixth Amendment issue.  The State Supreme Court remanded for further consideration in light of its intervening Cleveland decision, which held that a trial court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a juror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the evidence.  Reaffirming its prior decision on remand, the State Court of Appeal discussed Cleveland, again quoted Wood, and failed to expressly acknowledge that Williams had raised a federal claim.
			

				
				
				
				
				When Williams later sought federal habeas relief, the District Court applied 2254s deferential standard of review for claims adjudicated on the merits and denied relief.  But the Ninth Circuit concluded that the State Court of Appeal had not considered Williams 
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  The court then reviewed that claim denovo and held that the questioning and dismissal of the juror violated the 
 
Sixth Amendment.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.For purposes of 2254(d), when a state court rules against a defendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendants claims but does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Pp.713.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)This conclusion follows logically from Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___.  There, the Court held that when a state court issues an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address any of the defendants claims, there is no sound reason not to apply its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not all of those claims.  Federal habeas courts should not assume that any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by a defendant.  In fact, they frequently take a different course.  They may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Petitioners argument for an irrebuttable presumption goes too far.  Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard, the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the merits.  See Early v. Packer, 

537 U.S. 3
.  But where, e.g., the state standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in passing, the presumption may be rebuttedeither by a habeas petitioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurally defaulted).  See Coleman v. Thompson, 

501 U.S. 722
.  An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong.  It would also improperly excise 2254(d)s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated on the merits.  The experience of the lower federal courts shows that allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				2.Applying the rebuttable presumption of merits adjudication here, the Ninth Circuit erred by finding that the State Court of Appeal overlooked Williams 
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  Several facts lead to that conclusion.  Most important is that the court discussed Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the 
 
Sixth Amendment implications of discharging holdout jurors.  Though Cleveland refused to follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional question.  Regardless of whether a California court would consider Williams state-law and 
 
Sixth Amendment claims to be coextensive, their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal decided one while overlooking the other.  The State Court of Appeals quotation of Wood, supra, at 145146, further confirms that it was well aware that the jurors questioning and dismissal implicated federal law.  Williams litigation strategy also supports this result.  She treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not surprising that the state courts did as well.  Notably, Williams neither petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had failed to adjudicate her 
 
Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.  Pp.1316.

				JOHNSON, ACTING WARDEN v. WILLIAMS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11465.Argued October 3, 2012Decided February 20, 2013
			

				The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) provides that a federal habeas court may not grant relief to a state prisoner whose claim has already been adjudicated on the merits in State court, 

28 U.S.C. 2254(d), unless the claims adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court, 2254(d)(1), or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(d)(2).
			

				
				
				
				
				A California jury convicted respondent Williams of first-degree murder.  On direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal, she claimed that the trial courts questioning and dismissal of a juror during deliberations violated both the 
 
Sixth Amendment and California law.  In holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted the definition of impartiality from United States v. Wood, 

299 U.S. 123
146, but it did not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a 
 
Sixth Amendment issue.  The State Supreme Court remanded for further consideration in light of its intervening Cleveland decision, which held that a trial court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a juror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the evidence.  Reaffirming its prior decision on remand, the State Court of Appeal discussed Cleveland, again quoted Wood, and failed to expressly acknowledge that Williams had raised a federal claim.
			

				
				
				
				
				When Williams later sought federal habeas relief, the District Court applied 2254s deferential standard of review for claims adjudicated on the merits and denied relief.  But the Ninth Circuit concluded that the State Court of Appeal had not considered Williams 
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  The court then reviewed that claim denovo and held that the questioning and dismissal of the juror violated the 
 
Sixth Amendment.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.For purposes of 2254(d), when a state court rules against a defendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendants claims but does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Pp.713.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)This conclusion follows logically from Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___.  There, the Court held that when a state court issues an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address any of the defendants claims, there is no sound reason not to apply its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not all of those claims.  Federal habeas courts should not assume that any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by a defendant.  In fact, they frequently take a different course.  They may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)Petitioners argument for an irrebuttable presumption goes too far.  Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard, the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the merits.  See Early v. Packer, 

537 U.S. 3
.  But where, e.g., the state standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in passing, the presumption may be rebuttedeither by a habeas petitioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurally defaulted).  See Coleman v. Thompson, 

501 U.S. 722
.  An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong.  It would also improperly excise 2254(d)s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated on the merits.  The experience of the lower federal courts shows that allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				2.Applying the rebuttable presumption of merits adjudication here, the Ninth Circuit erred by finding that the State Court of Appeal overlooked Williams 
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  Several facts lead to that conclusion.  Most important is that the court discussed Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the 
 
Sixth Amendment implications of discharging holdout jurors.  Though Cleveland refused to follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional question.  Regardless of whether a California court would consider Williams state-law and 
 
Sixth Amendment claims to be coextensive, their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal decided one while overlooking the other.  The State Court of Appeals quotation of Wood, supra, at 145146, further confirms that it was well aware that the jurors questioning and dismissal implicated federal law.  Williams litigation strategy also supports this result.  She treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not surprising that the state courts did as well.  Notably, Williams neither petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had failed to adjudicate her 
 
Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.  Pp.1316.
			

				646 F.3d 626, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

			A California jury convicted Williams of murder. On direct appeal she claimed that questioning and dismissal of a juror during deliberations violated the Sixth Amendment and California law. Holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted a Supreme Court definition of impartiality, but did not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment issue. The states highest court remanded in light of its intervening decision that a trial court abused its discretion by dismissing, for failure to deliberate, a juror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury. Reaffirming its prior decision, the court of appeal discussed that decision and again failed to expressly acknowledge the federal claim. Williams ought federal habeas relief. The district court applied the deferential standard of review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act for claims already adjudicated on the merits in State court, 28 U. S. C. 2254(d). The Ninth Circuit concluded that the state court had not considered Williams Sixth Amendment claim, reviewed that claim de novo, and found violation of the Sixth Amendment.  The Supreme Court reversed. When a state court rules against a defendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendants claims but does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits for purposes of AEDPA.  Applying that rebuttable presumption, the Ninth Circuit erred. Several facts indicate that the state court did consider the Sixth Amendment claim.

				CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
			

				No. 11820.Argued November 1, 2012Decided February 20, 2013
			

				Immigration officials initiated removal proceedings against petitioner Chaidez in 2009 upon learning that she had pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 2004.  To avoid removal, she sought to overturn that conviction by filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis, contending that her former attorneys failure to advise her of the guilty pleas immigration consequences constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the 
 
Sixth Amendment.  While her petition was pending, this Court held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, that the 
 
Sixth Amendment requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the deportation risks of guilty pleas.  The District Court vacated Chaidezs conviction, determining that Padilla did not announce a new rule under Teague v. Lane, 

489 U.S. 288
, and thus applied to Chaidezs case.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had declared a new rule and should not apply in a challenge to a final conviction.
			

				Held:Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.  Pp. 315.
			

				
				
				(a)Under Teague, a person whose conviction is already final may not benefit from a new rule of criminal procedure on collateral review.  A case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendants conviction became final.  Teague, 489 U.S., at 301.  And a holding is not so dictated unless it would have been apparent to all reasonable jurists.  Lambrix v. Singletary, 

520 U.S. 518
528.  At the same time, a case does not announce a new rule, [when] it [is] merely an application of the principle that governed a prior decision to a different set of facts.  Teague, 489 U.S., at 307.  Thus, garden-variety applications of the test in Strickland v. Washington, 

466 U.S. 668
, for assessing ineffective assistance claims do not produce new rules, id., at 687688.
			

				
				
				But Padilla did more than just apply Stricklands general standard to yet another factual situation.  Before deciding if failing to inform a client about the risk of deportation fell below [Stricklands] objective standard of reasonableness, 466 U.S., at 688, Padilla first considered the threshold question whether advice about deportation was categorically removed from the scope of the 
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel because it involved only a collateral consequence of a conviction, rather than a component of a criminal sentence, 559 U.S., at ___.  That is, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied, Padilla asked whether that test applied at all.
			

				
				
				That preliminary question came to the Court unsettled.  Hill v. Lockhart, 

474 U.S. 52
, had explicitly left open whether the 
 
Sixth Amendment right extends to collateral consequences.  That left the issue to the state and lower federal courts, and they almost unanimously concluded that the 
 
Sixth Amendment does not require attorneys to inform their clients of a convictions collateral consequences, including deportation.  Padillas contrary ruling thus answered an open question about the 
 
Sixth Amendments reach, in a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions.  In so doing, Padilla broke new ground and imposed a new obligation.  Pp. 311.
			

				
				
				(b)Chaidez argues that Padilla did no more than apply Strickland to a new set of facts.  But she ignores that Padilla had to develop new law to determine that Strickland applied at all.  The few lower court decisions she cites held only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepresent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client as to any important matter.  Those rulings do not apply to her case, and they do not show that all reasonable judges thought that lawyers had to advise their clients about deportation risks.  Neither does INS v. St. Cyr, 

533 U.S. 289
, have any relevance here.  In saying that a reasonably competent lawyer would tell a non-citizen client about a guilty pleas deportation consequences, St. Cyr did not determine that the 
 
Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.  It took Padilla to decide that question.  Pp.1115.
			

				655 F.3d 684, affirmed.

				HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
			

				No. 119307.Argued November 28, 2012Decided February 20, 2013
			

				A federal court of appeals normally will not correct a legal error made in a criminal trial unless the defendant first brought the error to the trial courts attention.  United States v. Olano, 

507 U.S. 725
.  But Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) provides an exception, permitting [a] plain error that affects substantial rights [to] be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] courts attention.
			

				
				
				
				
				Here, the District Court increased the length of petitioner Hendersons sentence so he could participate in a prison drug rehabilitation program.  Hendersons counsel did not object to the sentence, but, on appeal, Henderson claimed that the District Court plainly erred in increasing his sentence solely for rehabilitative purposes.  While the appeal was pending, this Court decided in Tapia v. United States, 563 U.S. ___, ___, that it is error for a court to impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.  While this meant that the District Courts sentence was erroneous, the Fifth Circuit determined that Rule 52(b) did not give it authority to correct the error.  In doing so, it concluded that an error is plain under the Rule only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial, but that, in this case, Circuit law was unsettled until Tapia was decided.
			

				Held:Regardless of whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, an error is plain within the meaning of Rule 52(b) so long as the error was plain at the time of appellate review.  Pp.313.
			

				
				
				(a)The question of whether an error must be plain at the time it is committed or at the time it is reviewed reflects two competing legal principles.  The principle that a right may be forfeited in a case if it is not timely asserted before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it favors limiting the assessment of plainness to the time of the errors commission.  See Olano, supra, at 731.  And the rule that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision favors assessing plainness at the time of review.  See Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 

393 U.S. 268
.  Because neither principle is absolute, the conflict cannot be decided by looking to one rather than the other.  The text of Rule 52(b) also leaves open the temporal question.  And relevant precedent does not directly answer the question.  In Olano, this Court said that Rule 52(b) authorizes an appeals court to correct a forfeited error only if (1) there is an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affect[s] substantial rights, 

507 U.S. 732
, and (4) that seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings, id., at 736.  In Johnson v. United States, 

520 U.S. 461
, the Court concluded that, where a trial courts decision was clearly correct under circuit law when made but becomes clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal[,] it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.  However, neither case addressed what rule should apply where the law is unsettled at the time of the error but plain at the time of review.  507 U.S., at 734, 520 U.S, at 467468.  Pp. 36.
			

				
				
				(b)This precedent, when read in light of the underlying background principles, leads to the conclusion that Rule 52(b)s plain error phrase applies at the time of review.  If plain error covers trial court decisions that were plainly correct when made and those that were plainly incorrect when made, it should cover cases in the middlei.e., where the law was neither clearly correct nor incorrect, but unsettled, at the time of the trial courts decision.  To hold to the contrary would lead to unjustifiably different treatment of similarly situated individuals, for there is no practical reason to treat a defendant more harshly simply because his circuits law was unclear at the time of trial.  Even if a time of error rule would provide an added incentive to counsel to call a trial judges attention to the matter so the judge could quickly consider remedial action, such incentive has little, if any, practical importance since counsel normally has good reasons for calling a trial courts attention to potential error, e.g., the advantage to counsel and client of having an error speedily corrected.  In sum, in contrast to a time of error rule, a time of review interpretation furthers the basic principle that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, Thorpe, supra, at 281; works little, if any, practical harm upon the competing administrative principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial courts attention; and is consistent with Rule 52(b)s basic purpose of creating a fairness-based exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial to preserve a claim of error.  Pp. 69.
			

				
				
				(c)The Governments arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Its claim that appellate courts should consider only errors that counsel called to the trial courts attention and errors that the court should have independently recognized overlooks the way in which Rule 52(b) restricts the appellate courts authority to correct an error to those errors that would, in fact, seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  The Government also fears that the holding here will lead to too many plain error claims.  But, a new rule of law set by an appellate court cannot automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous, given that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong fall outside the Rules scope, and given that any error must have affected the defendants substantial rights and affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Finally, the Governments textual argument that Rule 52(b) is written mostly in the past tense, whatever its merits, is foreclosed by Johnson.  Pp. 1012.
			

				646 F.3d 223, reversed and remanded.

But, a new rule of law set by an appellate court cannot automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous, given that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong fall outside the Rules scope, and given that any error must have affected the defendants substantial rights and affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Finally, the Governments textual argument that Rule 52(b) is written mostly in the past tense, whatever its merits, is foreclosed by Johnson.  Pp. 1012.

			The district court increased the length of Hendersons sentence so he could participate in a prison drug rehabilitation program. Hendersons counsel did not object to the sentence, but, on appeal, Henderson claimed plain error. While appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided, in Tapia v. United States, that it is error for a court to impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation. The Fifth Circuit determined that Rule 52(b) did not give it authority to correct the error, reasoning that an error is plain only if it was clear under law at the time of trial. The Supreme Court reversed.  Regardless of whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, an error is plain under Rule 52(b) if it was plain at the time of appellate review.  If plain error covers trial court decisions that were plainly correct when made and those that were plainly incorrect when made, it should cover cases where the law was unsettled. A time of review interpretation furthers the basic principle that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, works little harm upon the competing principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial courts attention, and is consistent with Rule 52(b)s purpose of creating a fairness-based exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial to preserve a claim of error.

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 111160.Argued November 26, 2012Decided February 19, 2013
			

				Under Georgias Hospital Authorities Law (Law), political subdivisions may create special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities to provide for the operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th[e] state.  The Law permits authorities to exercise public and essential governmental functions and delegates to them numerous general powers, including the ability to acquire and lease hospitals and other public health facilities.  Ga. Code Ann. 31775.
			

				
				
				
				
				The Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County (Authority) owns Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (Memorial), one of two hospitals in the county.  The Authority formed two private nonprofit corporations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc. (PPHS) and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc. (PPMH).  After the Authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county and lease it to a subsidiary of PPHS, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transaction would substantially reduce competition in the market for acute-care hospital services, in violation of 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and 7 of the Clayton Act.  The FTC and Georgia subsequently sued the Authority, PPHS, PPMH, and others (collectively respondents), seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative proceedings.  The District Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction and granted respondents motion to dismiss, holding that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the state-action doctrine.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  It concluded that the Authority, as a local governmental entity, was entitled to state-action immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a foreseeable result of the Law.  The court reasoned that the state legislature could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect, given the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities, particularly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation of hospital ownership.
			

				Held:Because Georgia has not clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed a policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions that substantially lessen competition, state-action immunity does not apply.  Pp.619.
			

				
				
				(a)This Court recognized in Parker v. Brown, 

317 U.S. 341
352, that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent States from imposing market restraints as an act of government ... .  Under the state-action doctrine, immunity from federal antitrust law may extend to nonstate actors carrying out the States regulatory program.  See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, 

486 U.S. 94
100.  But given the antitrust laws values of free enterprise and economic competition, state-action immunity is disfavored, FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 

504 U.S. 621
, and is recognized only when it is clear that the challenged anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to the States own regulatory scheme, id., at 635.  Immunity will attach only to activities of substate governmental entities that are undertaken pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition.  Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 

455 U.S. 40
.  A state legislature need not expressly state that intent, Hallie v. Eau Claire, 

471 U.S. 34
, but the anticompetitive effect must have been the foreseeable result of what the State authorized, id., at 42.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(b)Respondents state-action immunity defense fails under the clear-articulation test because there is no evidence the State affirmatively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competition by consolidating hospital ownership.  The Authoritys powers, including its acquisition and leasing powers, mirror general powers routinely conferred by state law on private corporations.  More is required to establish state-action immunity; the Authority must show that it has been delegated authority not just to act, but to act or regulate anticompetitively.  Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 

499 U.S. 365
.  In Boulder, this Court concluded that a Colorado law granting municipalities the power to enact ordinances governing local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test, 455 U.S., at 5556, because, when a States position is one of mere neutrality respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive, the State cannot be said to have contemplated those anticompetitive actions, id., at 55.
			

				
				
				That principle controls here.  Grants of general corporate power allowing substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive marketplace are typically used without raising federal antitrust concerns, so a State cannot be said to have contemplated that such powers will be used anticompetitively.  Here, though the Law allows the Authority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and affirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen competition.  Pp.910.
			

				
				
				(c)In concluding otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit applied the concept of foreseeability too loosely.  This Court, recognizing that no legislature can be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects of a statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity, Hallie, 471 U.S., at 43, has approached the clear-articulation inquiry practically, but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the State must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of competition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be attributed to the state itself, Parker, 317 U.S., at 352.  Thus, the Court has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.  In that scenario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.  See Hallie, 471 U.S., at 41; Omni, 499 U.S., at 373.  By contrast, when a State grants an entity a general power to act, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.  Entities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their powers anticompetitively, but a reasonable legislatures ability to anticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition.  The Eleventh Circuits argument, echoed by respondents, that the case falls within the foreseeability standard used in Hallie and Omni is rejected.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				(d)Respondents additional arguments are also unpersuasive.  They contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique powers and responsibilities to fulfill Georgias objective of providing access to adequate and affordable health care, it was foreseeable that they would decide that the best way to serve their communities was to acquire an existing local hospital, instead of incurring the additional expense and regulatory burden of expanding, or constructing, a facility.  But even though the authorities may differ from private corporations offering hospital services, neither the Law nor any other state-law provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authorities to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anticompetitive effects.  Respondents also contend that when there is doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied, federal courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state policy choices.  But the Law here is not ambiguous, and respondents suggestion is inconsistent with the principle that state-action immunity is disfavored, Ticor Title, 504 U.S., at 636.  Pp.1419.

				CHAFIN v. CHAFIN
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 111347.Argued December 5, 2012Decided February 19, 2013
			

				The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Contracting State to order a child returned to her country of habitual residence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in the Contracting State.  The International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) implements the Convention in the United States, granting federal and state courts concurrent jurisdiction over Convention actions and directing those courts to decide cases in accordance with the Convention.  ICARA also requires defendants to pay various expenses incurred by plaintiffs associated with the return of children.
			

				
				
				
				
				Petitioner Mr. Chafin, a United States citizen and member of the military, married respondent Ms. Chafin, a United Kingdom citizen, in Germany, where they later had a daughter, E.C.  When Mr. Chafin was deployed to Afghanistan, Ms. Chafin took E.C. to Scotland.  Mr. Chafin was later transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Ms. Chafin eventually traveled there with E.C.  Soon after Ms. Chafins arrival, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and child custody in Alabama.  Ms. Chafin was subsequently deported, but E.C. remained in Alabama with Mr. Chafin.  Several months later, Ms. Chafin filed a petition under the Convention and ICARA, seeking E.C.s return to Scotland.  The District Court concluded that E.C.s country of habitual residence was Scotland and granted the petition for return.  Ms. Chafin immediately departed for Scotland with E.C.  Ms. Chafin then initiated custody proceedings in Scotland and was granted interim custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mr. Chafin from removing E.C. from Scotland.  Mr. Chafin appealed the District Courts order, but the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot, on the ground that once a child has been returned to a foreign country, a U.S. court becomes powerless to grant relief.  On remand, the District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for court costs, attorneys fees, and travel expenses.
			

				Held:The return of a child to a foreign country pursuant to a Convention return order does not render an appeal of that order moot.  Pp.514.
			

				
				
				(a)Article III restricts the power of federal courts to Cases and Controversies, and this requirement subsists through all stages of [the] proceedings, Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 

494 U.S. 472
.  No case or controversy exists, and a suit becomes moot, when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome, Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. ___, ___.  But a case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party, Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U.S. ___, ___.  As long as the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot, ibid.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)Because the Chafins continue to vigorously contest the question of where their daughter will be raised, this dispute is very much alive.  This case does not address a hypothetical state of facts, Lewis, supra, at 477, and there continues to exist between the parties that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues, Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.611.    
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)Mr. Chafin seeks typical appellate relief: reversal of the District Court determination that E.C.s habitual residence was Scotland and, upon reversal, an order that E.C. be returned to the United States.  The question is whether such relief would be effectual.  In arguing that this case is moot because the District Court has no authority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its inherent equitable powers, Ms. Chafin confuses mootness with the merits.  See, e.g., Powell v. McCormack, 

395 U.S. 486
.  Mr. Chafins claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, and his prospects of success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry.  As to the effectiveness of any relief, even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return order, this case would not be moot.  The U.S. courts continue to have personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin and may command her to take action under threat of sanctions.  She could decide to comply with an order against her and return E.C. to the United States.  Enforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the District Courts expense orders.  That too is common relief on appeal, and the mootness inquiry comes down to its effectiveness.  In contending that this case is moot due to Mr. Chafins failure to pursue an appeal of the expense orders, which were entered as separate judgments, Ms. Chafin again confuses mootness with the merits.  Because there is authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments separately does not preclude relief, it is for lower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks.  That relief would not be fully satisfactory, but even the availability of a partial remedy is sufficient to prevent [a] case from being moot, Calderon v. Moore, 

518 U.S. 149
.  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				(c)Manipulating constitutional doctrine and holding these cases moot is not necessary to achieve the ends of the Convention and ICARA, and may undermine the treatys goals and harm the children meant to be protected.  If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course, to prevent the loss of any right to appeal.  Such routine stays would conflict with the Conventions mandate of prompt return.  Courts should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, 

556 U.S. 418
, thus ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment necessary for appropriate consideration of the childs best interests.  Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.  Pp.1114.
			

				Vacated and remanded.

518 U.S. 149
.  Pp.1011.
			

				
				
				(c)Manipulating constitutional doctrine and holding these cases moot is not necessary to achieve the ends of the Convention and ICARA, and may undermine the treatys goals and harm the children meant to be protected.  If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course, to prevent the loss of any right to appeal.  Such routine stays would conflict with the Conventions mandate of prompt return.  Courts should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, 

556 U.S. 418
, thus ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment necessary for appropriate consideration of the childs best interests.  Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.  Pp.1114.

			The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction requires contracting states to order a child returned to her country of habitual residence upon finding that the child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in the contracting state. The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U. S. C. 11601, implements the Convention. Chafin, a U.S. citizen, married a United Kingdom citizen (mother), in Germany, where they had a daughter, E. C. When Chafin was deployed with the military to Afghanistan, mother took E. C. to Scotland.  When Chafin was transferred to Alabama, mother traveled there with E. C.  Chafin filed for divorce and custody. Mother filed a petition under the Convention and ICARA. The district court concluded that E. C.s country of habitual residence was Scotland. In Scotland, mother was granted interim custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting  Chafin from removing E. C. The Eleventh Circuit dismissed Chafins appeal as moot.  The Supreme Court vacated and remanded. Return of a child to a foreign country does not render appeal of a return order moot.  The Chafins continue to contest where their daughter will be raised. Chafins claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction; his prospects of success are not pertinent to mootness. Even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return order, U. S. courts would continue to have personal jurisdiction over mother and could command her to take action under threat of sanctions. Enforcement of the order may be uncertain, but that does not typically render cases moot. If cases were to become moot upon return of a child, courts would be more likely to routinely grant stays, to prevent loss of any right to appeal, conflicting with the Conventions mandate of prompt return.

				BAILEY v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 11770.Argued November 1, 2012Decided February 19, 2013
			

				While police were preparing to execute a warrant to search a basement apartment for a handgun, detectives conducting surveillance in an unmarked car outside the apartment saw two menlater identified as petitioner Chunon Bailey and Bryant Middletonleave the gated area above the apartment, get in a car, and drive away.  The detectives waited for the men to leave and then followed the car approximately a mile before stopping it.  They found keys during a patdown search of Bailey, who initially said that he resided in the apartment but later denied it when informed of the search.  Both men were handcuffed and driven in a patrol car to the apartment, where the search team had already found a gun and illicit drugs.  After arresting the men, police discovered that one of Baileys keys unlocked the apartments door.
			

				
				
				
				
				At trial, the District Court denied Baileys motion to suppress the apartment key and the statements he made to the detectives when stopped, holding that Baileys detention was justified under Michigan v. Summers, 

452 U.S. 692
, as a detention incident to the execution of a search warrant, and, in the alternative, that the detention was supported by reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio, 

392 U.S. 1
.  Bailey was convicted.  The Second Circuit affirmed denial of the suppression motion.  Finding that Summers authorized Baileys detention, it did not address the alternative Terry holding.
			

				Held:The rule in Summers is limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched and does not apply here, where Bailey was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question.  Pp.415.
			

				
				
				(a)The Summers rule permits officers executing a search warrant to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted, 452 U.S., at 705, even when there is no particular suspicion that an individual is involved in criminal activity or poses a specific danger to the officers, Muehler v. Mena, 

544 U.S. 93
.  Detention is permitted because the character of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are substantial.  Id., at 98.  In Summers and later cases the detained occupants were found within or immediately outside the residence being searched.  Here, however, petitioner left the apartment before the search began and was detained nearly a mile away.  Pp.46.
			

				
				
				(b)In Summers, the Court recognized three important law enforcement interests that, taken together, justify detaining an occupant who is on the premises during the search warrants execution, 452 U.S., at 702703.  The first, officer safety, requires officers to secure the premises, which may include detaining current occupants so the officers can search without fear that the occupants will become disruptive, dangerous, or otherwise frustrate the search.  If an occupant returns home during the search, officers can mitigate the risk by taking routine precautions.  Here, however, Bailey posed little risk to the officers at the scene after he left the premises, apparently without knowledge of the search.  Had he returned, he could have been apprehended and detained under Summers.  Were police to have the authority to detain persons away from the premises, the authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detaining those who are on the scene.  As for the Second Circuits additional concerns, if officers believe that it would be dangerous to detain a departing individual in front of a residence, they are not required to stop him; and if officers have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, they can instead rely on Terry.  The risk that a departing occupant might alert those still inside the residence is also an insufficient safety rationale for expanding the detention authority beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.
			

				
				
				The second law enforcement interest is the facilitation of the completion of the search.  Unrestrained occupants can hide or destroy evidence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the way.  But a general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search cannot justify detention beyond the vicinity of the premises.  Occupants who are kept from leaving may assist the officers by opening locked doors or containers in order to avoid the use of force that can damage property or delay completion of the search.  But this justification must be confined to persons on site as the search warrant is executed and so in a position to observe the progression of the search.
			

				
				
				The third interest is the interest in preventing flight, which also serves to preserve the integrity of the search.  If officers are concerned about flight in the event incriminating evidence is found, they might rush the search, causing unnecessary damage or compromising its careful execution.  The need to prevent flight, however, if unbounded, might be used to argue for detention of any regular occupant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search, e.g., detaining a suspect 10 miles away, ready to board a plane.  Even if the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could facilitate a later arrest if incriminating evidence is discovered, the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the 
 
Fourth Amendment.  Mincey v. Arizona, 

437 U.S. 385
.
			

				
				
				In sum, none of the three law enforcement interests identified in Summers applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.  And each is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in Summers to permit the detention of a former occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search.  Pp.612.
			

				
				
				(c)As recognized in Summers, the detention of a current occupant represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant, 452 U.S., at 703, but an arrest of an individual away from his home involves an additional level of intrusiveness.  A public detention, even if merely incident to a search, will resemble a full-fledged arrest and can involve the indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises.  P.12.
			

				
				
				(d)Limiting the rule in Summers to the area within which an occupant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search is confined to its underlying justification.  Because petitioner was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of immediate vicinity, there is no need to further define that term here.  Since detention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search, the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later time in a more remote place.  Pp.1315.
			

				
				
				(e)The question whether stopping petitioner was lawful under Terry remains open on remand.  P.15.
			

				652 F.3d 197, reversed and remanded.

				FLORIDA v. HARRIS
			

				certiorari to the supreme court of florida
			

				No. 11817.Argued October 31, 2012Decided February 19, 2013
			

				Officer Wheetley pulled over respondent Harris for a routine traffic stop.  Observing Harriss nervousness and an open beer can, Wheetley sought consent to search Harriss truck.  When Harris refused, Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo.  The dog alerted at the drivers-side door handle, leading Wheetley to conclude that he had probable cause for a search.  That search turned up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephedrine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine.  Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those ingredients.  In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo again alerted on Harriss truck but nothing of interest was found.  At a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldos extensive training in drug detection.  Harriss attorney did not contest the quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldos certification and performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harriss truck.  The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida Supreme Court reversed.  It held that a wide array of evidence was always necessary to establish probable cause, including field-performance records showing how many times the dog has falsely alerted.  If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator of drugs.
			

				Held:Because training and testing records supported Aldos reliability in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that evidence, Wheetley had probable cause to search Harriss truck.  Pp.511.
			

				
				
				(a)In testing whether an officer has probable cause to conduct a search, all that is required is the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people] act.  Illinois v. Gates, 

462 U.S. 213
.  To evaluate whether the State has met this practical and common-sensical standard, this Court has consistently looked to the totality of the circumstances and rejected rigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries.  Ibid.  
			

				
				
				The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established approach by creating a strict evidentiary checklist to assess a drug-detection dogs reliability.  Requiring the State to introduce comprehensive documentation of the dogs prior hits and misses in the field, and holding that absent field records will preclude a finding of probable cause no matter how much other proof the State offers, is the antithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances approach.  This is made worse by the State Supreme Courts treatment of field-performance records as the evidentiary gold standard when, in fact, such data may not capture a dogs false negatives or may markedly overstate a dogs false positives.  Such inaccuracies do not taint records of a dogs performance in standard training and certification settings, making that performance a better measure of a dogs reliability.  Field records may sometimes be relevant, but the court should evaluate all the evidence, and should not prescribe an inflexible set of requirements.  
			

				
				
				Under the correct approach, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dogs alert should proceed much like any other, with the court allowing the parties to make their best case and evaluating the totality of the circumstances.  If the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, the court should find probable cause.  But a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dogs reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.  The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed or too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert.  The court should then consider all the evidence and apply the usual test for probable causewhether all the facts surrounding the alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime.  Pp.59.
			

				
				
				(b)The record in this case amply supported the trial courts determination that Aldos alert gave Wheetley probable cause to search the truck.  The State introduced substantial evidence of Aldos training and his proficiency in finding drugs.  Harris declined to challenge any aspect of that training or testing in the trial court, and the Court does not consider such arguments when they are presented for this first time in this Court.  Harris principally relied below on Wheetleys failure to find any substance that Aldo was trained to detect.  That infers too much from the failure of a particular alert to lead to drugs, and did not rebut the States evidence from recent training and testing.  Pp.911.

				SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
			

				No. 111231.Argued December 4, 2012Decided January 22, 2013
			

				The reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a hospitals patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), called the SSI fraction.  Each year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible hospital and submits that number to the hospitals fiscal intermediary, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.  The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR).  A provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within 180 days of receiving the NPR.  

42 U.S.C. 1395oo(a)(3).  By regulation, the Secretary of HHS authorized the PRRB to extend the 180-day limit, for good cause, up to three years.  See 42 CFR 405.1841(b) (2007).
			

				
				
				
				
				The Baystate Medical Centernot a party heretimely appealed its SSI fraction calculation for each year from 1993 through 1996.  The PRRB found that errors in CMSs methodology resulted in a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment and corresponding underpayments to providers.  In March 2006, the Boards Baystate decision was made public.  Within 180 days, respondent hospitals filed a complaint with the Board, challenging their adjustments for 1987 through 1994.  Acknowledging that their challenges were more than a decade out of time, they urged that equitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to CMSs failure to tell them about the computation error.  The PRRB held that it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save those legislation or regulation might confer.  On judicial review, the District Court dismissed the hospitals claims.  The D.C. Circuit reversed.  The presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling, the court concluded, applied to the 180-day time limit because nothing in 1395oo(a)(3) indicated that Congress intended to disallow such tolling.

				No. 111231.Argued December 4, 2012Decided January 22, 2013
			

				The reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a hospitals patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), called the SSI fraction.  Each year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible hospital and submits that number to the hospitals fiscal intermediary, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.  The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR).  A provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within 180 days of receiving the NPR.

			Reimbursement providers for inpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve disproportionate numbers of patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services annually submit the SSI fraction for eligible hospitals to a fiscal intermediary, a Health and Human Services contractor, which computes the reimbursement amount and sends the hospitals notice. A provider may appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board within 180 days, 42 U. S. C. 1395oo(a)(3). The PRRB may extend the period, for good cause, up to three years, 42 CFR 405.1841(b).  A hospital timely appealed its SSI fraction calculations for 1993 through 1996. The PRRB found that errors in CMSs methodology resulted in a systematic under-calculation.  When the decision was made public, hospitals challenged their adjustments for 1987 through 1994. The PRRB held that it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save those granted by legislation or regulation. The district court dismissed the claims. The D. C. Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court reversed. While the 180-day limitation is not jurisdictional and does not preclude regulatory extension, the regulation is a permissible interpretation of 1395oo(a)(3).  Applying deferential review, the Court noted the Secretarys practical experience in superintending the huge program and the PRRB.  Rejecting an argument for equitable tolling, the Court noted that for nearly 40 years the Secretary has prohibited extensions, except as provided by regulation, and Congress not amended the 180-day provision or the rule-making authority. The statutory scheme, which applies to sophisticated institutional providers, is not designed to be unusually protective of claimants.

				LOZMAN v. CITY OF RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
			

				No. 11626.Argued October 1, 2012Decided January 15, 2013
			

				Petitioner Lozmans floating home was a house-like plywood structure with empty bilge space underneath the main floor to keep it afloat.  He had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by the city of Riviera Beach (City).  After various disputes with Lozman and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina, the City brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home, seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass.  Lozman moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction.  The District Court found the floating home to be a vessel under the Rules of Construction Act, which defines a vessel as including every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water, 1  U.S.C. 3, concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper, and awarded the City dockage fees and nominal damages.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the home was a vessel since it was capable of movement over water despite petitioners subjective intent to remain moored indefinitely.
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.This case is not moot.  The District Court ordered the floating home sold, and the City purchased the home at auction and had it destroyed.  Before the sale, the court ordered the City to post a bond to ensure Lozman could obtain monetary relief if he prevailed.  P.3.
			

				
				
				2.Lozmans floating home is not a 3 vessel.  Pp.315.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The Eleventh Circuit found the home capable of being used ... as a means of transportation on water because it could float and proceed under tow and its shore connections did not render it incapable of transportation.  This interpretation is too broad.  The definition of transportation, the conveyance of persons or things from one place to another, must be applied in a practical way.  Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 

543 U.S. 481
.  Consequently, a structure does not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer, looking to the homes physical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.  Pp.35.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)But for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozmans home suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport persons or things over water.  It had no steering mechanism, had an unraked hull and rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water, and had no capacity to generate or store electricity.  It also lacked self-propulsion, differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				
				
				(c)This view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent, and relevant purposes.  The statutes language, read naturally, lends itself to that interpretation:  The term contrivance refers to something employed in contriving to effect a purpose; craft explains that purpose as water carriage and transport; the addition of water to craft emphasizes the point; and the words, used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water, drive the point home.  Both Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bottling Co., 

271 U.S. 19
, and Stewart, supra, support this conclusion.  Evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock, used to transfer cargo, and towed to harbor each winter; and Stewart involved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor, which carried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating anchors and cables or by being towed.  Water transportation was not the primary purpose of either structure; neither was in motion at relevant times; and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom or to land.  However, Stewarts dredge, which was regularly, but not primarily, used to transport workers and equipment over water, fell within the statutory definition while Evansvilles wharfboat, which was not designed to, and did not, serve a transportation function, did not.  Lower court cases, on balance, also tend to support this conclusion.  Further, the purposes of major federal maritime statutese.g., admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid liability by sailing away, recognize that sailors face special perils at sea, and encourage shipowners to engage in port-related commercereveal little reason to classify floating homes as vessels.  Finally, this conclusion is consistent with state laws in States where floating home owners have congregated in communities.  Pp.611.
			

				
				
				
				
				(d)Several important arguments made by the City and its amici are unavailing.  They argue that a purpose-based test may introduce a subjective element into vessel determinations.  But the Court has considered only objective evidence, looking to the views of a reasonable observer and the physical attributes and behavior of the structure.  They also argue against using criteria that are too abstract, complex, or open-ended.  While this Courts approach is neither perfectly precise nor always determinative, it is workable and consistent and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.  And contrary to the dissents suggestion, the Court sees nothing to be gained by a remand.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				
				
				(e)The Citys additional argument that Lozmans floating home was actually used for transportation over water is similarly unpersuasive.  P.14.

				SMITH v. UNITED STATES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
			

				No. 118976.Argued November 6, 2012Decided January 9, 2013
			

				Petitioner Smith claimed that conspiracy charges brought against him for his role in an illegal drug business, see 

21 U.S.C. 846 and 

18 U.S.C. 1962(d), were barred by 

18 U.S.C. 3282s 5-year statute of limitations.  The District Court instructed the jury to convict Smith of each conspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith was a member of those conspiracies, and that the conspiracies continued within the applicable statute-of-limitations period.  As to the affirmative defense of withdrawal from the conspiracy, the court instructed the jury that once the Government proved that Smith was a member of the conspiracy, Smith had the burden to prove withdrawal outside the statute of limitations by a preponderance of the evidence.  Smith was convicted, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed.  
			

				Held:A defendant bears the burden of proving a defense of withdrawal.  Pp.38.
			

				
				
				(a)Allocating to the defendant the burden of proving withdrawal does not violate the Due Process Clause.  Unless an affirmative defense negates an element of the crime, the Government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Dixon v. United States, 

548 U.S. 1
.  Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here, but instead presupposes that the defendant committed the offense.  Withdrawal terminates a defendants liability for his co-conspirators postwithdrawal acts, but he remains guilty of conspiracy.  
			

				
				
				Withdrawal that occurs beyond the statute-of-limitations period provides a complete defense to prosecution, but does not render the underlying conduct noncriminal.  Thus, while union of withdrawal with a statute-of-limitations defense can free a defendant of criminal liability, it does not place upon the prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that he did not withdraw.  As with other affirmative defenses, the burden is on him.  Pp.36.
			

				
				
				(b)Although Congress may assign the Government the burden of proving the nonexistence of withdrawal, it did not do so here.  Because Congress did not address the burden of proof for withdrawal in 

21 U.S.C. 846 or 

18 U.S.C. 1962(d), it is presumed that Congress intended to preserve the common-law rule that affirmative defenses are for the defendant to prove.  Dixon, supra, at 1314.  The analysis does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-of-limitations defense.  In that circumstance, the Government need only prove that the conspiracy continued past the statute-of-limitations period.  A conspiracy continues until it is terminated or, as to a particular defendant, until that defendant withdraws.  And the burden of establishing withdrawal rests upon the defendant.  Pp.68.
			

				651 F.3d 30, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

			Smith claimed that drug conspiracy charges under 21 U. S. C.846 and 18 U. S. C. 1962(d), were barred by 18 U. S. C.3282s five-year statute of limitations. The district court instructed the jury to convict Smith if the government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith was a member, and that the conspiracies continued within the limitations period. As to the affirmative defense of withdrawal, the court instructed the jury that Smith had the burden to prove withdrawal outside the limitations period by a preponderance of the evidence. Smith was convicted. The D. C. Circuit and the Supreme Court affirmed.  Allocating to the defendant the burden of proving withdrawal does not violate the Due Process Clause. Unless an affirmative defense negates an element of the crime, the government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Withdrawal does not negate an element of conspiracy but only terminates a defendants liability for co-conspirators post-withdrawal acts. Withdrawal that occurs beyond the limitations period provides a complete defense to prosecution, but that does not give the prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that he did not withdraw. Because the statutes do not address the burden of proof for withdrawal, it is presumed that the common law rule applies.. A conspiracy continues until it is terminated or, as to a particular defendant, until that defendant withdraws and the burden of establishing withdrawal rests upon the defendant.

				ALREADY, LLC, dba YUMS v. NIKE, INC.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
			

				No. 11982.Argued November 7, 2012Decided January 9, 2013
			

				Nike filed this suit, alleging that two of Alreadys athletic shoes violated Nikes Air Force 1 trademark.  Already denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nikes Air Force 1 trademark.  While the suit was pending, Nike issued a Covenant Not to Sue, promising not to raise any trademark or unfair competition claims against Already or any affiliated entity based on Alreadys existing footwear designs, or any future Already designs that constituted a colorable imitation of Alreadys current products.   Nike then moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice, and to dismiss Alreadys counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the covenant had extinguished the case or controversy.  Already opposed dismissal of its counterclaim, contending that Nike had not established that its covenant had mooted the case.  In support, Already presented an affidavit from its president, stating that Already planned to introduce new versions of its lines into the market; affidavits from three potential investors, asserting that they would not consider investing in Already until Nikes trademark was invalidated; and an affidavit from an Already executive, stating that Nike had intimidated retailers into refusing to carry Alreadys shoes.  The District Court dismissed Alreadys counterclaim, concluding that there was no longer a justiciable controversy.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  It explained that the covenant was broadly drafted; that the court could not conceive of a shoe that would infringe Nikes trademark yet not fall within the covenant; and that Already had not asserted any intent to market such a shoe.
			

				Held:This case is moot.  Pp.315.
			

				
				
				(a)A case becomes mootand therefore no longer a Case or Controversy for Article III purposeswhen the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.  Murphy v. Hunt, 

455 U.S. 478
.  A defendant cannot, however, automatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful conduct once sued.  City of Mesquite v. Aladdins Castle, Inc., 

455 U.S. 283
.  Instead, a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 

528 U.S. 167
.  Pp.34.
			

				
				
				(b)Nike has the burden to show that it could not reasonably be expected to resume its enforcement efforts against Already.  The voluntary cessation doctrine was not disavowed in Deakins v. Monaghan, 

484 U.S. 193
.  There, the Court employed precisely the analysis the test requires, finding a case moot because the challenged actionpursuing a claim in courtcould not be resumed in this or any subsequent action and because it was entirely speculative that any similar claim would arise in the future.  Id., at 201, n.4.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(c)Application of the voluntary cessation doctrine shows that this case is moot.  Pp.614.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The breadth of the covenant suffices to meet the burden imposed by the doctrine.  The covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.  It prohibits Nike from filing suit or making any claim or demand; protects both Already and Alreadys distributors and customers; and covers not just current or previous designs, but also colorable imitations.  Once Nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of Alreadys allegedly unlawful conduct, it became incumbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities that would arguably infringe Nikes trademark yet not be covered by the covenant.  But Already failed to do so in the courts below or in this Court.  The case is thus moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur.  Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Intl, Inc., 

508 U.S. 83
, and Altvater v. Freeman, 

319 U.S. 359
, distinguished.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Alreadys alternative theories of Article III injuries do not save the case from mootness, because none of those injuries suffices to support Article III standing in the first place.  Already argues that as long as Nike is free to assert its trademark, investors will hesitate to invest in Already.  But once it is absolutely clear that challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur, Friends of the Earth, supra, at 190, the fact that some individuals may base decisions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish Article III standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 

504 U.S. 555
.  Already worries about its retailers, but even if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will take action against the plaintiffs retailers, the covenant here extends protection to Alreadys distributors and customers.  Already also complains that Nikes decision to sue in the first place has led Already to fear another suit.  But, since Nike has met its burden to demonstrate that there is no reasonable risk of such a suit, this concern is unfounded.  Already falls back on the sweeping argument that, as one of Nikes competitors, it inherently has standing because no covenant can eradicate the effects of a registered but invalid trademark.  The logical conclusion of this theory seems to be that a market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawfule.g., a trademark or the awarding of a contractbut this Court has never accepted such a boundless theory of standing. 
			

				
				
				Alreadys policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to bully small innovators does not support adoption of this broad theory.  Granting covenants not to sue may be a risky long-term strategy for a trademark holder.  And while accepting Alreadys theory may benefit the small competitor in this case, it also lowers the gates for larger companies with more resources, who may challenge the intellectual property portfolios of more humble rivals simply because they are competitors in the same market.  This would further encourage parties to employ litigation as a weapon against their competitors rather than as a last resort for settling disputes.  Pp.914.
			

				
				
				(d)No purpose would be served by remanding the case.  Already has had every opportunity and incentive to submit evidence in the proceedings below.  It has refused, at every stage of the proceedings, to suggest that it has any plans to design a shoe that violates the Air Force 1 trademark yet falls outside the covenant.  And while the courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary cessation standard, their analysis addressed the same questions this Court addresses here under that standard.  Pp.1415.
			

				663 F.3d 89, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Thomas, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

				RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS v. VALENCIA GONZALES
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 10930.Argued October 9, 2012Decided January 8, 2013
				[
					1
				]
				
			

				Respondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought federal habeas relief.  His counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuits Rohan decision, what is now 

18 U.S.C. 3599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent.  The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales input.  Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit.  Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nashwhich gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appealsthe court granted the writ, concluding that 3599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings.  The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel.  Applying the Ninth Circuits Rohan test, it determined that Carters assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims.  It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, 

384 U.S. 312
 (Rees I), located a statutory right to competence in 

18 U.S.C. 4241, and found that a court could employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to forgo his petition.  It thus ordered that Carters petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspension of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompetent.  Pp.512.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The assertion of such a right lacks any basis in the provisions text.  Section 3599 guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death row the right to federally funded counsel, 3599(a)(2), and sets out various requirements that appointed counsel must meet, 3599(b)(e), but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when petitioners are found incompetent.  The assertion is also difficult to square with the Courts constitutional precedents.  If the 
 
Sixth Amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence, the right to competence at trial would flow from that Amendment, not from the right to due process, see Cooper v. Oklahoma, 

517 U.S. 348
.  But while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney, this Court has never said that the right to competence derives from the right to counsel.  And the Court will not assume or infer that Congress intended to depart from such precedent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings within the right to counsel.  See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The Ninth Circuit identified its rule in Rohan, concluding there that a petitioners mental incompetency could eviscerate the statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings.  But given the backward-looking, record-based nature of 2254 proceedings, counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioners competence.  Rees I, supra, Rees v. Peyton, 

386 U.S. 989
, and Rees v. Superintendent of the Va. State Penitentiary, 516 U.S 802, which involved an incompetent death row inmates attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition, offer no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the Ninth Circuits opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.  The Ninth Circuits interpretation is also not supported by McFarland v. Scott, 

512 U.S. 849
, in which this Court held that a district court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had invoked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.  In contrast, Gonzales is seeking to stay the District Courts proceedings, and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition, certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.  Pp.712.
			

				
				
				2.Section 4241 also does not provide a statutory right to competence during federal habeas proceedings.  The Sixth Circuit based its conclusion largely on a misreading of Rees I, which did not recognize such a right.  Moreover, 4241 does not even apply to habeas proceedings.  By its terms, it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.  Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated, not on probation.  Furthermore, 4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally, applies exclusively to federal defendants, not to state prisoners like Carter.  Finally, 4241(a) authorizes a district court to grant a motion for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendants mental incompetence renders him unable to understand ... the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense, while a 2254 habeas proceeding is a civil action against a state-prison warden, in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction in an earlier state trial.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				3.For purposes of resolving these cases, it is sufficient to address the outer limits of the district courts discretion to issue stays; it is unnecessary to determine the precise contours of that discretion.  In Gonzales case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay after finding that Gonzales claims were all record based or resolvable as a matter of law, regardless of his competence.  Review of a petitioners record-based claims subject to 2254(d) is limited to the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.  Any evidence that Gonzales might have would be inadmissible.  In Carters case, three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings and thus subject to review under 2254(d).  Thus, extrarecord evidence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmissible.  It is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth claim.  If it was exhausted, it too would be record based.  But even if it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted, an indefinite stay would be inappropriate, since such a stay would permit petitioners to frustrate [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s] goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Rhines v. Weber, 

544 U.S. 269
278.  Pp.1418.

				Respondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought federal habeas relief.  His counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuits Rohan decision, what is now 

18 U.S.C. 3599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent.  The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales input.  Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit.  Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nashwhich gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appealsthe court granted the writ, concluding that 3599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings.  The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel.  Applying the Ninth Circuits Rohan test, it determined that Carters assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims.  It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, 

384 U.S. 312
 (Rees I), located a statutory right to competence in 

18 U.S.C. 4241, and found that a court could employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to forgo his petition.  It thus ordered that Carters petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.  
			

				Held:
			

				
				
				1.Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspension of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompetent.  Pp.512.
			

				
				
				
				
				(a)The assertion of such a right lacks any basis in the provisions text.  Section 3599 guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death row the right to federally funded counsel, 3599(a)(2), and sets out various requirements that appointed counsel must meet, 3599(b)(e), but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when petitioners are found incompetent.  The assertion is also difficult to square with the Courts constitutional precedents.  If the 
 
Sixth Amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence, the right to competence at trial would flow from that Amendment, not from the right to due process, see Cooper v. Oklahoma, 

517 U.S. 348
.  But while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney, this Court has never said that the right to competence derives from the right to counsel.  And the Court will not assume or infer that Congress intended to depart from such precedent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings within the right to counsel.  See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.57.
			

				
				
				
				
				(b)The Ninth Circuit identified its rule in Rohan, concluding there that a petitioners mental incompetency could eviscerate the statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings.  But given the backward-looking, record-based nature of 2254 proceedings, counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioners competence.  Rees I, supra, Rees v. Peyton, 

386 U.S. 989
, and Rees v. Superintendent of the Va. State Penitentiary, 516 U.S 802, which involved an incompetent death row inmates attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition, offer no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the Ninth Circuits opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.  The Ninth Circuits interpretation is also not supported by McFarland v. Scott, 

512 U.S. 849
, in which this Court held that a district court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had invoked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.  In contrast, Gonzales is seeking to stay the District Courts proceedings, and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition, certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.  Pp.712.
			

				
				
				2.Section 4241 also does not provide a statutory right to competence during federal habeas proceedings.  The Sixth Circuit based its conclusion largely on a misreading of Rees I, which did not recognize such a right.  Moreover, 4241 does not even apply to habeas proceedings.  By its terms, it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.  Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated, not on probation.  Furthermore, 4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally, applies exclusively to federal defendants, not to state prisoners like Carter.  Finally, 4241(a) authorizes a district court to grant a motion for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendants mental incompetence renders him unable to understand ... the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense, while a 2254 habeas proceeding is a civil action against a state-prison warden, in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction in an earlier state trial.  Pp.1214.
			

				
				
				3.For purposes of resolving these cases, it is sufficient to address the outer limits of the district courts discretion to issue stays; it is unnecessary to determine the precise contours of that discretion.  In Gonzales case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay after finding that Gonzales claims were all record based or resolvable as a matter of law, regardless of his competence.  Review of a petitioners record-based claims subject to 2254(d) is limited to the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.  Any evidence that Gonzales might have would be inadmissible.  In Carters case, three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings and thus subject to review under 2254(d).  Thus, extrarecord evidence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmissible.  It is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth claim.  If it was exhausted, it too would be record based.  But even if it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted, an indefinite stay would be inappropriate, since such a stay would permit petitioners to frustrate [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s] goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Rhines v. Weber, 

544 U.S. 269
278.  Pp.1418.
			

				623 F.3d 1242, No. 10930, reversed; 644 F.3d 329, No. 11218, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

			Gonzales, an Arizona death row inmate, sought federal habeas relief. Counsel sought a stay, contending that mental incompetence prevented Gonzales from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that 18 U. S. C.3599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent. The district court denied a stay, finding that Gonzales claims were record based or resolvable as a matter of law. The Ninth Circuit held that Gonzales had a right to a stay pending a competency determination. Carter, an Ohio death row inmate, initiated federal habeas proceedings but later moved for a competency determination and stay. The district court granted the motion, found Carter incompetent, dismissed his petition without prejudice, and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations. The Sixth Circuit identified a right to competence in 18 U. S. C. 4241 and ordered indefinite stay with respect to claims requiring assistance. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspension of federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompetent and that Section 4241 does not provide a right to competence during federal habeas proceedings.  Review of record-based claims, 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), is limited to the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits and extra-record evidence concerning such claims is inadmissible.

				Syllabus
			

				LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT v. NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC., etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
			

				No. 11460.Argued December 4, 2012Decided January 8, 2013
			

				Petitioner Los Angeles County Flood Control District (District) operates a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), a drainage system that collects, transports, and discharges storm water.  Because storm water is often heavily polluted, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and its implementing regulations require certain MS4 operators to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit before discharging storm water into navigable waters.  The District has such a permit for its MS4.  Respondents Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and Santa Monica Baykeeper (Baykeeper) filed a citizen suit against the District and others under 505 of the CWA, 

33 U.S.C. 1365, alleging, among other things, that water-quality measurements from monitoring stations within the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers demonstrated that the District was violating the terms of its permit.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the District on these claims, concluding that the record was insufficient to warrant a finding that the MS4 had discharged storm water containing the standards-exceeding pollutants detected at the downstream monitoring stations.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.  The court held that the District was liable for the discharge of pollutants that, in the courts view, occurred when the polluted water detected at the monitoring stations flowed out of the concrete-lined portions of the rivers, where the monitoring stations are located, into lower, unlined portions of the same rivers.  
			

				Held:The flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of a pollutant under the CWA.  See South Fla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 

541 U.S. 95
112 (holding that the transfer of polluted water between two parts of the same water body does not constitute a discharge of pollutants under the CWA).  The Ninth Circuits decision cannot be squared with this holding.
			

				
				
				
				
				The NRDC and Baykeeper alternatively argue that, based on the terms of the Districts NPDES permit, the exceedances detected at the monitoring stations sufficed to establish the Districts liability under the CWA for its upstream discharges.  This argument, which failed below, is not embraced within the narrow question on which certiorari was granted.  The Court therefore does not address it.  Pp.35.
			

				673 F.3d 880, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., concurred in the judgment.
