SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
heien v. north carolina
certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina
No. 13604.Argued October 6, 2014Decided December 15, 2014
Following a suspicious vehicle, Sergeant Matt Darisse noticed that only one of the vehicles brake lights was working and pulled the driver over.  While issuing a warning ticket for the broken brake light, Darisse became suspicious of the actions of the two occupants and their answers to his questions.  Petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien, the cars owner, gave Darisse consent to search the vehicle.  Darisse found cocaine, and Heien was arrested and charged with attempted trafficking.  The trial court denied Heiens motion to suppress the seized evidence on
 
Fourth Amendment grounds, concluding that the vehicles faulty brake light gave Darisse reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the relevant code provision, which requires that a car be equipped with a stop lamp, N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 20129(g), requires only a single lampwhich Heiens vehicle hadand therefore the justification for the stop was objectively unreasonable.  Reversing in turn, the State Supreme Court held that, even assuming no violation of the state law had occurred, Darisses mistaken understanding of the law was reasonable, and thus the stop was valid.
Held:Because Darisses mistake of law was reasonable, there was reasonable suspicion justifying the stop under the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Pp. 413.

            
        (a)The
 
Fourth Amendment requires government officials to act reasonably, not perfectly, and gives those officials fair leeway for enforcing the law, Brinegar v. United States,

338 U.S. 160
.  Searches and seizures based on mistakes of fact may be reasonable.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Rodriguez,

497 U.S. 177
186.  The limiting factor is that the mistakes must be those of reasonable men.  Brinegar, supra, at 176.  Mistakes of law are no less compatible with the concept of reasonable suspicion, which arises from an understanding of both the facts and the relevant law.  Whether an officer is reasonably mistaken about the one or the other, the result is the same: the facts are outside the scope of the law.  And neither the
 
Fourth Amendments text nor this Courts precedents offer any reason why that result should not be acceptable when reached by a reasonable mistake of law.

            
        More than two centuries ago, this Court held that reasonable mistakes of law, like those of fact, could justify a certificate of probable cause.  United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch 311, 313.  That holding was reiterated in numerous 19th-century decisions.  Although Riddle was not a
 
Fourth Amendment case, it explained the concept of probable cause, which this Court has said carried the same fixed and well known meaning in the
 
Fourth Amendment, Brinegar, supra, at 175, and n.14, and no subsequent decision of this Court has undermined that understanding.  The contrary conclusion would be hard to reconcile with the more recent precedent of Michigan v. DeFillippo,

443 U.S. 31
, where the Court, addressing the validity of an arrest made under a criminal law later declared unconstitutional, held that the officers reasonable assumption that the law was valid gave them abundant probable cause to make the arrest, id., at 37.  Heien attempts to recast DeFillippo as a case solely about the exclusionary rule, not the
 
Fourth Amendment itself, but DeFillippos express holding is that the arrest was constitutionally valid because the officers had probable cause.  See id., at 40.  Heien misplaces his reliance on cases such as Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. ___, where any consideration of reasonableness was limited to the separate matter of remedy, not whether there was a
 
Fourth Amendment violation in the first place.

            
        Heien contends that the rationale that permits reasonable errors of fact does not extend to reasonable errors of law, arguing that officers in the field deserve a margin of error when making factual assessments on the fly.  An officer may, however, also be suddenly confronted with a situation requiring application of an unclear statute.  This Courts holding does not discourage officers from learning the law.  Because the
 
Fourth Amendment tolerates only objectively reasonable mistakes, cf. Whren v. United States,

517 U.S. 806
, an officer can gain no advantage through poor study.  Finally, while the maxim Ignorance of the law is no excuse correctly implies that the State cannot impose punishment based on a mistake of law, it does not mean a reasonable mistake of law cannot justify an investigatory stop.  Pp.412.

            
        (b)There is little difficulty in concluding that Officer Darisses error of law was reasonable.  The North Carolina vehicle code that requires a stop lamp also provides that the lamp may be incorporated into a unit with one or more other rear lamps, N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 20129(g), and that all originally equipped rear lamps must be in good working order, 20129(d).  Although the State Court of Appeals held that rear lamps do not include brake lights, the word other, coupled with the lack of state-court precedent interpreting the provision, made it objectively reasonable to think that a faulty brake light constituted a violation.  Pp.1213.
367 N.C. 163, 749 S. E. 2d 278, affirmed.

            
        Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

dart cherokee basin operating co., llc, etal. v. owens
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 13719.Argued October 7, 2014Decided December 15, 2014
A defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.

28 U.S.C. 1446(a).  

            
        
            
        Respondent Owens filed a putative class action in Kansas state court, seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly sustained when petitioners (collectively, Dart) underpaid royalties due under certain oil and gas leases.  Dart removed the case to the Federal District Court, invoking the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class actions if the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million,

28 U.S.C. 1332(d)(2).  Darts notice of removal alleged that the purported underpayments totaled over $8.2 million.  Owens moved to remand the case to state court, asserting that the removal notice was deficient as a matter of law because it included no evidence proving that the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million.  In response, Dart submitted an executives detailed declaration supporting an amount in controversy in excess of $11 million.  The District Court granted Owens remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself.  Dart petitioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see 1453(c)(1), but that court denied review and rehearing en banc. 
Held: 

            
        1.As specified in 1446(a), a defendants notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain evidentiary submissions.

            
        Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  By borrowing Rule 8(a)s short and plain statement standard, corroborative history indicates, Congress intended to clarify that courts should apply the same liberal rules [to removal allegations as] to other matters of pleading.  H.R. Rep. No. 100889, p. 71.  The amount-in-controversy allegation of a plaintiff invoking federal-court jurisdiction is accepted if made in good faith.  See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,

429 U.S. 274
.  Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.  In the event that the plaintiff does contest the defendants allegations, both sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied, see 1446(c)(2)(B).

            
        In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in part, on a purported presumption against removal, but no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.  See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.47.

            
        2.The District Court erred in remanding this case for want of an evidentiary submission in the notice of removal, and the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision.  Pp.714.

            
        
            
        (a)This Court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes settlement of the question presented: whether evidence supporting the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.  The case was in the Tenth Circuit because of Darts application for leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the Court of Appeals did with that application.  See

28 U.S.C. 1254; Hohn v. United States,

524 U.S. 236
.  Pp.78.

            
        
            
        (b) While appellate review of a remand order is discretionary, exercise of that discretion is not rudderless, see Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 572 U.S. ___, ___, and a court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law, Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,

496 U.S. 384
.  The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under 1453(c)(1).  One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of appeals should inquire whether, if a district courts remand order remains undisturbed, the case will leave the ambit of the federal courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] ... to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.  BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma exrel. Edmondson, 613 F.3d 1029, 1035.  Thus the Tenth Circuits own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Darts appeal.  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals denial of review established the lawthe requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the removal noticenot simply for this case, but for future CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defendants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary submission.

            
        The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Darts amount-in-controversy allegation failed for want of proof.  It was an abuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Darts request for review, for that disposition fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view of the law.  Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not detail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp.814.
Vacated and remanded.

            
        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kennedy and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Thomas, J., joined as to all but the final sentence.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

        The joint motion for entry of a supplemental decree is granted.

FIFTH SUPPLEMENTAL DECREE 
On October 27, 1947, this Court entered a final decree addressing the entitlement of the United States and the State of California to lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Pacific Ocean offshore of California.  United States v. California,

332 U.S. 804 (1947)
 (per curiam).  On January 31, 1966, this Court entered a supplemental decree redefining the federal-state boundary pursuant to the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1301-1315.

382 U.S. 448 (1966)
 (per curiam). Between 1977 and 1981, this Court issued three additional supplemental decrees further delineating particular portions of the federal-state boundary.

432 U.S. 40 (1977)
;

439 U.S. 30 (1978)
;

449 U.S. 408 (1981)
. For the purpose of identifying with greater particularity the boundary line between the submerged lands of California and those of the United States, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed as follows:
(1a)
continuous
As against the United States, with the exceptions provided by Section 5 of the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1313, the State of California is entitled to all lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Pacific Ocean, bounded on the south by the international boundary with the United Mexican States and on the north by the boundary between the States of California and Oregon and an extension thereof, that lie landward of the lines described in paragraph 3 below.
As against the State of California, the United States is entitled to all lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Pacific Ocean, bounded on the south by the international boundary with the United Mexican States and on the north by the boundary between the States of California and Oregon and an extension thereof, that lie seaward of the lines described in paragraph 3 below.
The federal-state boundary lines, referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, are located as follows:

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
integrity staffing solutions, INC. v. busk etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13433.Argued October 8, 2014Decided December 9, 2014
Petitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., required its hourly warehouse workers, who retrieved products from warehouse shelves and packaged them for delivery to Amazon.com customers, to undergo a security screening before leaving the warehouse each day.  Respondents, former employees, sued the company alleging, as relevant here, that they were entitled to compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) for the roughly 25 minutes each day that they spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those screenings.  They also alleged that the company could have reduced that time to a de minimis amount by adding screeners or staggering shift terminations and that the screenings were conducted to prevent employee theft and, thus, for the sole benefit of the employers and their customers.

            
        
            
        The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, holding that the screenings were not integral and indispensable to the employees principal activities but were instead postliminary and noncompensable.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, asserting that postshift activities that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary activities are compensable as integral and indispensable to an employees principal activities if the postshift activities are necessary to the principal work and performed for the employers benefit.
Held:The time that respondents spent waiting to undergo and undergoing security screenings is not compensable under the FLSA.  Pp.39.

            
        (a)Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act to respond to an economic emergency created by the broad judicial interpretation given to the FLSAs undefined terms work and workweek.  See 29 U.S.C. 251(a); Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123,

321 U.S. 590
.  The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from FLSA liability for claims based on activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to the performance of the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform.  254(a)(2).  Under this Courts precedents, the term principal activities includes all activities which are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities.  Steiner v. Mitchell,

350 U.S. 247
253.  An activity is integral and indispensable if it is an intrinsic element of the employees principal activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities.  This Court has identified several activities that satisfy this testsee, e.g., id., at 249, 251; Mitchell v. King Packing Co.,

350 U.S. 260
and Department of Labor regulations are consistent with this approach, see 29 CFR 790.8(c), 790.7(g).  Pp.37.

            
        (b)The security screenings at issue are noncompensable postliminary activities.  To begin with, the screenings were not the principal activities the employees were employed to performi.e., the workers were employed not to undergo security screenings but to retrieve products from warehouse shelves and package them for shipment.  Nor were they integral and indispensable to those activities.  This view is consistent with a 1951 Department of Labor opinion letter, which found noncompensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act both a preshift screening conducted for employee safety and a postshift search conducted to prevent employee theft.  The Ninth Circuits test, which focused on whether the particular activity was required by the employer rather than whether it was tied to the productive work that the employee was employed to perform, would sweep into principal activities the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal Act was designed to exclude from compensation.  See, e.g., IBP, supra, at 41.  Finally, respondents claim that the screenings are compensable because Integrity Staffing could have reduced the time to a de minimis amount is properly presented at the bargaining table, not to a court in an FLSA claim.  Pp.79.
713 F. 3d 525, reversed.

            
        Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Sotomayor, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Kagan, J., joined.

Security screenings were not the principal activities the employees were employed to perform, nor were they integral and indispensable to those activities. Whether the screenings are compensable because Integrity could have reduced the time is properly presented at the bargaining table.

				WARGER v. SHAUERS
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
			

				No. 13517.Argued October 8, 2014Decided December 9, 2014
			

				Petitioner Gregory Warger sued respondent Randy Shauers in federal court for negligence for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.  After the jury returned a verdict for Shauers, one of the jurors contacted Wargers counsel, claiming that Regina Whipple, the jury foreperson, had revealed during deliberations that her daughter had been at fault in a fatal motor vehicle accident, and that a lawsuit would have ruined her daughters life.  Armed with an affidavit from the juror, Warger moved for a new trial, arguing that Whipple had deliberately lied during voirdire about her impartiality and ability to award damages.  The District Court denied Wargers motion, holding that Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which bars evidence about any statement made ... during the jurys deliberations, barred the affidavit, and that none of the Rules three exceptions, see Rule 606(b)(2), were applicable.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
			

				Held:
			

				
				    
				1.Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voirdire.  Pp.310.
			

				
				    
				
				    
				(a)This reading accords with the plain meaning of Rule 606(b), which applies to an inquiry into the validity of [the] verdict.  This understanding is also consistent with the underlying common-law rule on which Congress based Rule 606(b).  The so-called federal rule made jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if used to demonstrate dishonesty during voirdire.  Both the majority of courts and this Courts pre-Rule606(b) cases, see McDonald v. Pless, 

238 U.S. 264
; Clark v. United States, 

289 U.S. 1
, favored this rule over the Iowa rule, which permitted the use of such jury deliberations evidence.  The federal approach is clearly reflected in the language Congress chose when it enacted Rule 606(b), and legislative history confirms that Congress choice was no accident.  See Tanner v. United States, 

483 U.S. 107
.  Pp.38.
			

				  
				    
				
				    
				(b)Wargers arguments against this straightforward understanding are not persuasive.  Pp.810.
			

				
				    
				
				    
				
				    
				(1)First, Warger insists that proceedings for a new trial based on voirdire dishonesty do not involve an inquiry into the validity of the verdict.  His reading would restrict Rule 606(b)s application to claims of error for which a court must examine the manner in which the jury reached its verdict, but the Rule does not focus on the means by which deliberations evidence might be used to invalidate a verdict.  It simply applies during a proceeding in which a verdict may be rendered invalid.  Pp.89.
			

				
				    
				
				    
				
				    
				(2)Warger also contends that excluding jury deliberations evidence that shows voirdire dishonesty is unnecessary to fulfill Congress objectives, but his arguments would apply to all evidence rendered inadmissible by Rule 606(b), and he cannot escape the scope of the Rule merely by asserting that Congress concerns were misplaced.  P.9.
			

				
				    
				
				    
				
				    
				(3)Finally, Warger invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance, contending that only his interpretation protects the right to an impartial jury.  But that canon has no application here, where there is no ambiguity.  See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative, 

532 U.S. 483
.  Moreover, this Courts Tanner decision forecloses any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional.  Similar to the right at issue in that case, Wargers right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 606(b)s removal of one means of ensuring unbiased jurors.  Even if a juror lies to conceal bias, parties may bring to the courts attention evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered and use nonjuror evidence after the verdict is rendered.  Pp.910.
			

				
				    
				2.The affidavit at issue was not admissible under Rule 606(b)(2)(A)s exception for evidence of extraneous prejudicial information.  Generally speaking, extraneous information derives from a source external to the jury.  See Tanner, 483 U.S., at 117.  Here, the excluded affidavit falls on the internal side.  Warger contends that any information Whipple shared with the other jurors was extraneous because she would have been disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her daughters accident.  However, such an exception would swallow up much of the rest of the restrictive version of the common-law rule that Congress adopted in enacting Rule 606(b).  Pp.1113.
			

				721 F.3d 606, affirmed.
			

				
				    
				Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

14-95|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
PATRICK GLEBE, SUPERINTENDENT, STAFFORD CREEK CORRECTIONS CENTER v.JOSHUA JAMES FROST
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 1495Decided November 17, 2014
continuousevenrId9firstrId10

            
        Per Curiam.

            
        Over 11 days in April 2003, respondent Joshua Frost helped two associates commit a series of armed robberies in the State of Washington.  In the main, Frost drove his confederates to and from their crimes.  On one occasion, he also entered the house being robbed.  On another, he performed surveillance in anticipation of the robbery.

            
        Washington charged Frost with robbery and related offenses.  Taking the witness stand, Frost admitted to his involvement, but claimed he acted under duress.  As closing arguments drew near, however, Frosts lawyer expressed the desire to contend both (1) that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that Frost was an accomplice to the crimes and (2) that Frost acted under duress.  The trial judge insisted that the defense choose between these alternative arguments, explaining that state law prohib-ited a defendant from simultaneously contesting the elements of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense of duress.  So Frosts lawyer limited his summation to duress.  The jury convicted Frost of six counts of robbery, one count of attempted robbery, one count of burglary, and two counts of assault.

            
        The Washington Supreme Court sustained Frosts conviction.  It rejected the trial courts view that state law prohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal liability and arguing duress.  State v. Frost, 160 Wash. 2d 765, 773776, 161 P.3d 361, 366368 (2007) (en banc).  By preventing the defense from presenting both theories during summation, it said, the trial court violated the National Constitutions Due Process and Assistance of Counsel Clauses.  Id., at 777779, 161 P.3d, at 368369.  But the State Supreme Court continued, this improper restriction of closing argument qualified as a trial error (a mistake reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a structural error (a mistake that requires automatic reversal).  Id., at 779782, 161 P.3d, at 369370.  Because the jury heard three taped confessions and Frosts admission of guilt on the witness stand, and because it received proper instructions on the States burden of proof, the State Supreme Court held that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 782783, 161 P.3d, at 370371.

            
        Frost filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under

28 U.S.C. 2254.  The District Court dismissed the petition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and a panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed, Frost v. Van Boening, 692 F.3d 924 (CA9 2012).  But the Court of Appeals en banc reversed and instructed the District Court to grant relief.  757 F. 3d 910 (2014).

            
        Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to grant Frost habeas corpus only if the Washington Supreme Courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.

28 U.S.C. 2254(d).  Here, the Ninth Circuit held that the Washington Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing to classify the trial courts restriction of closing argument as structural error.

            
        That decision cannot stand.  Assuming for arguments sake that the trial court violated the Constitution, it was not clearly established that its mistake ranked as structural error.  Most constitutional mistakes call for reversal only if the government cannot demonstrate harmlessness.  Neder v. United States,

527 U.S. 1,
8 (1999)
.  Only the rare type of errorin general, one that infect[s] the entire trial process and necessarily render[s] [it] fundamentally unfairrequires automatic reversal.  Ibid.  None of our cases clearly requires placing improper restriction of closing argument in this narrow category.

            
        The Ninth Circuit claimed that the Washington Supreme Court contradicted Herring v. New York,

422 U.S. 853 (1975)
. Herring held that complete denial of summation violates the Assistance of Counsel Clause.  According to the Ninth Circuit, Herring further held that this denial amounts to structural error.  We need not opine on the accuracy of that interpretation.  For even assuming that Herring established that complete denial of summation amounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish that the restriction of summation also amounts to structural error.  A court could reasonably conclude, after all, that prohibiting all argument differs from prohibiting argument in the alternative.  That is all the more true because our structural-error cases ha[ve] not been characterized by [an] in for a penny, in for a pound approach.  Neder, supra, at 17, n.2.

            
        Attempting to bridge the gap between Herring and this case, the Ninth Circuit cited two Circuit precedentsUnited States v. Miguel, 338 F.3d 995 (CA9 2003), and Conde v. Henry, 198 F.3d 734 (CA9 2000)for the proposition that preventing a defendant from arguing a legitimate defense theory constitutes structural error.  757 F.3d, at 916.  As we have repeatedly emphasized, how-ever, circuit precedent does not constitute clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.  2254(d)(1); see, e.g., Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 6).  The Ninth Circuit acknowledged this rule, but tried to get past it by claiming that circuit precedent could help ... determine what law is clearly established.  757 F.3d, at 916, n.1.  But neither Miguel nor Conde arose under AEDPA, so neither purports to reflect the law clearly established by this Courts holdings.  The Ninth Circuit thus had no justification for relying on those decisions.  See Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13).

            
        The second rationale for the Court of Appeals decision is no more sound than the first.  The Ninth Circuit reasoned that, by allowing the prosecution to argue that it had proved the elements of the crimes, but prohibit[ing] the defense from responding that it had not, the trial court in effect forc[ed] defense counsel to concede his clients guilt.  757 F.3d, at 917.  By extracting this conce[ssion], the Ninth Circuit continued, the trial court relieved the State of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, shifted the burden of proof to Frost, and even directed [a] verdict on guiltall unquestionably structural [errors].  Id., at 917918.

            
        No.  The trial court, to begin, did not prohibit the defense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the crime.  It instead precluded the defense from simultaneously contesting reasonable doubt and claiming duress.  Reasonable minds could disagree whether requiring the defense to choose between alternative theories amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt.  Still more could they disagree whether it amounts to eliminating the prosecutions burden of proof, shifting the burden to the defendant, or directing a verdict.  In addition, even if the trial courts ruling somehow forced the defense at least tacitly [to] admit the elements of the crimes, id., at 913, the Ninth Circuit still would have no basis for ruling as it did.  It goes much too far to suggest that our cases clearly establish that this supposed extraction of a taci[t] admi[ssion] is structural error, when they classify the introduction of a coerced confession only as trial error, Arizona v. Fulminante,

499 U.S. 279,
310 (1991)
.

        Frost argued below that, even if it was reasonable for the State Supreme Court to treat improper restriction of summation as trial error, it was unreasonable for it to find harmlessness on the facts of this case.  The Court of Appeals did not address this argument when sitting en banc, and it is not before us today.

            
        We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis.  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

			Frost helped associates commit armed robberies in Washington, generally as the driver. Frost admitted involvement, but claimed he acted under duress. Frosts lawyer planned to argue both that the state failed to meet its burden of proof and that Frost acted under duress. The judge insisted that the defense choose between the arguments, explaining that state law prohibited simultaneously contesting the elements of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense of duress.  Frosts lawyer limited his summation to duress. The jury convicted Frost of robbery, attempted robbery, burglary, and assault. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting the trial courts view that state law prohibited Frost from both contesting liability and arguing duress and stating that this improper restriction qualified as a trial error (reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a structural error (requiring automatic reversal). Because the jury heard taped confessions and Frosts confession on the witness stand, the court held that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court dismissed his habeas petition; the Ninth Circuit, en banc, reversed.  A unanimous Supreme Court reversed. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the petition could be granted only if the state court decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,. 28 U. S. C. 2254(d). No Supreme Court case clearly requires placing improper restriction of closing argument in these narrow categories. The trial court did not prohibit the defense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the crime. Reasonable minds could disagree whether requiring the defense to choose between alternative theories.

13-1318|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
TRACEY L. JOHNSON, etal. v. CITY OF SHELBY,MISSISSIPPI
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 131318.Decided November 10, 2014

            
        Per Curiam.

            
        Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, worked as police officers for the city of Shelby, Mississippi.  They allege that they were fired by the citys board of aldermen, not for deficient performance, but because they brought to light criminal activities of one of the aldermen.  Charging violations of their
 
Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, they sought compensatory relief from the city.  Summary judgment was entered against them in the District Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to invoke

42 U.S.C. 1983 in their complaint.

            
        We summarily reverse.  Federal pleading rules call for a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2); they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See Advisory Committee Report of October 1955, reprinted in 12A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane, R. Marcus, and A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure, p. 644 (2014 ed.) (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are designed to discourage battles over mere form of statement); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, 1215, p. 172 (3d ed. 2002) (Rule 8(a)(2) indicates that a basic objective of the rules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities).  In particular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to invoke 1983 expressly in order to state a claim.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,

507 U.S. 163,
164 (1993)
 (a federal court may not apply a standard more stringent than the usual pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) in civil rights cases alleging municipal liability); Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,

534 U.S. 506,
512 (2002)
 (imposing a height-ened pleading standard in employment discrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)).

            
        The Fifth Circuit defended its requirement that complaints expressly invoke 1983 as not a mere pleading formality.  743 F.3d 59, 62 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The requirement serves a notice function, the Fifth Circuit said, because [c]ertain consequences flow from claims under 1983, such as the unavailability of respondeat superior liability, which bears on the qualified immunity analysis.  Ibid.  This statement displays some confusion in the Fifth Circuits perception of petitioners suit.  No qualified immunity analysis is implicated here, as petitioners asserted a constitutional claim against the city only, not against any municipal officer.  See Owen v. Independence,

445 U.S. 622,
638 (1980)
 (a municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability under 1983).

            
        Our decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544 (2007)
, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662 (2009)
, are not in point, for they concern the factual allegations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to dismiss.  A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts sufficient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility.  Petitioners complaint was not deficient in that regard.  Petitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events that, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city.  Having informed the city of the factual basis for their complaint, they were required to do no more to stave off threshold dismissal for want of an adequate statementof their claim.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2) and (3), (d)(1), (e).  For clarification and to ward off further insistence on a punctiliously stated theory of the pleadings, petitioners, on remand, should be accorded an opportunity to add to their complaint a citation to 1983.  See 5 Wright & Miller, supra, 1219, at 277278 (The federal rules effectively abolish the restrictive theory of the pleadings doctrine, making it clear that it is unnecessary to set out a legal theory for the plaintiffs claim for relief. (footnotes omitted)); Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 15(a)(2) (The court should freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so requires.).

        For the reasons stated, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

14-212|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JEREMY CARROLL v. ANDREW CARMAN, et ux.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 14212.Decided November 10, 2014

            
        Per Curiam.

            
        On July 3, 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police Department received a report that a man named Michael Zita had stolen a car and two loaded handguns.  The report also said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew and Karen Carman.  The department sent Officers Jeremy Carroll and Brian Roberts to the Carmans home to investigate.  Neither officer had been to the home before.  749 F.3d 192, 195 (CA3 2014).

            
        The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around 2:30 p.m.  The Carmans house sat on a corner lotthe front of the house faced a main street while the left (as viewed from the front) faced a side street.  The officers initially drove to the front of the house, but after discovering that parking was not available there, turned right onto the side street.  As they did so, they saw several cars parked side-by-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the Carmans property.  The officers parked in the first available spot, at the far rear of the property.  Ibid.  (quoting Tr. 70 (Apr. 8, 2013)).

            
        The officers exited their patrol cars.  As they looked toward the house, the officers saw a small structure (either a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on.  Id., at 71.  Thinking someone might be inside, Officer Carroll walked over, poked [his] head in, and said Pennsylvania State Police.  749 F.3d, at 195 (quoting Tr. 71 (Apr. 8, 2013); alteration in original).  No one was there, however, so the officers continued walking toward the house.  As they approached, they saw a sliding glass door that opened onto a ground-level deck.  Carroll thought the sliding glass door looked like a customary entryway, so he and Officer Roberts decided to knock on it.  749 F.3d, at 195 (quoting Tr. 83 (Apr. 8, 2013)).

            
        As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came outof the house and belligerent[ly] and aggressively approached them.  749 F.3d, at 195.  The officers identified themselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita, and asked the man for his name.  The man refused to answer.  Instead, he turned away from the officers and appeared to reach for his waist.  Id., at 195196.  Carroll grabbed the mans right arm to make sure he was not reaching for a weapon.  The man twisted away from Carroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard.  Id., at 196.

            
        At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked what was happening.  The officers again explained that they were looking for Zita.  The woman then identified herself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her husband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was not there.  In response, the officers asked for permission to search the house for Zita.  Karen Carman consented, and everyone went inside.  Ibid.

            
        The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita.  They then left.  The Carmans were not charged with any crimes.  Ibid.

            
        The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal District Court under

42 U.S.C. 1983.  Among other things, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their property in violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment when he went into their backyard and onto their deck without a warrant.  749 F.3d, at 196.

            
        At trial, Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under the knock and talk exception to the warrant requirement.  That exception, he contended, allows officers to knock on someones door, so long as they stay on those portions of [the] property that the general public is allowed to go on.  Tr. 7 (Apr. 8, 2013).  The Carmans responded that a normal visitor would have gone to their front door, rather than into their backyard or onto their deck.  Thus, they argued, the knock and talk exception did not apply.

            
        At the close of Carrolls case in chief, the parties each moved for judgment as a matter of law.  The District Court denied both motions, and sent the case to a jury.  As relevant here, the District Court instructed the jury that the knock and talk exception allows officers without a warrant to knock on a residents door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants, just as any private citizen might.  Id., at 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).  The District Court further explained that officers should restrict their movements to walkways, driveways, porches and places where visitors could be expected to go.  Ibid.  The jury then returned a verdict for Carroll.

            
        The Carmans appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed in relevant part.  The court held that Officer Carroll violated the
 
Fourth Amendment as a matter of law because the knock and talk exception requires that police officers begin their encounter at the front door, where they have an implied invitation to go.  749 F.3d, at 199.  The court also held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated clearly established law.  Ibid.  The court therefore reversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

            
        Carroll petitioned for certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse the Third Circuits determination that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity.

            
        A government official sued under 1983 is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.  See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3).  A right is clearly established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  Anderson v. Creighton,

483 U.S. 635,
640 (1987)
.  In other words, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  This doctrine gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments, and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting Malley v. Briggs,

475 U.S. 335,
341 (1986)
).

            
        Here the Third Circuit cited only a single case to support its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunityEstate of Smith v. Marasco, 318 F.3d 497 (CA3 2003).  Assuming for the sake of argument that a controlling circuit precedent could constitute clearly established federal law in these circumstances, see Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7), Marasco does not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Carmans
 
Fourth Amendment rights.

            
        In Marasco, two police officers went to Robert Smiths house and knocked on the front door.  When Smith did not respond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least one entered the garage.  318 F.3d, at 519.  The court acknowledged that the officers entry into the curtilage after not receiving an answer at the front door might be reasonable.  Id., at 520.  It held, however, that the District Court had not made the factual findings needed to decide that issue.  Id., at 521.  For example, the Third Circuit noted that the record did not discuss the layout of the property or the position of the officers on that prop-erty, and that there [was] no indication of whether the officers followed a path or other apparently open route that would be suggestive of reasonableness.  Ibid.  The court therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.

            
        In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly established law in this case, the Third Circuit relied exclusively on Marascos statement that entry into the curtilage after not receiving an answer at the front door might be reasonable.  Id., at 520; see 749 F.3d, at 199 (quoting Marasco, supra, at 520).  In the courts view, that statement clearly established that a knock and talk must begin at the front door.  But that conclusion does not follow.  Marasco held that an unsuccessful knock and talk at the front door does not automatically allow officers to go onto other parts of the property.  It did not hold, however, that knocking on the front door is required before officers go onto other parts of the property that are open to visitors.  Thus, Marasco simply did not answer the question whether a knock and talk must begin at the front door when visitors may also go to the back door.  Indeed, the house at issue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone one that visitors could use.  318 F.3d, at 521.

            
        Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that there [was] no indication of whether the officers followed a path or other apparently open route that would be suggestive of reasonableness.  Ibid.  That makes Marasco wholly different from this case, where the jury necessarily decided that Carroll restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, driveways, porches and places where visitors could be expected to go.  Tr. 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).

            
        To the extent that Marasco says anything about this case, it arguably supports Carrolls view.  In Marasco, the Third Circuit noted that [o]fficers are allowed to knock on a residences door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private citizen may.  318 F.3d, at 519.  The court also said that, when the police come on to private property ... and restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observations made from such vantage points are not covered by the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Ibid. (quoting 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 2.3(f) (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2003) (footnotes omitted)).  Had Carroll read those statements before going to the Carmans house, he may have concludedquite reasonablythat he was allowed to knock on any door that was open to visitors.[1]*

            
        The Third Circuits decision is even more perplexing in comparison to the decisions of other federal and state courts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit adopted here.  For example, in United States v. Titemore, 437 F.3d 251 (CA2 2006), a police officer approached a house that had two doors.  The first was a traditional door that opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding glass door that opened onto a small porch.  The officer chose to knock on the latter.  Id., at 253254.  On appeal, the defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully entered his property without a warrant in violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 255256.  But the Second Circuit rejected that argument.  As the court explained, the sliding glass door was a primary entrance visible to and used by the public.  Id., at 259.  Thus, [b]ecause [the officer] approached a principal entrance to the home using a route that other visitors could be expected to take, the court held that he did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 252.

            
        The Seventh Circuits decision in United States v. James, 40 F.3d 850 (1994), vacated on other grounds,

516 U.S. 1022 (1995)
, provides another example.  There, police officers approached a duplex with multiple entrances.  Bypassing the front door, the officers used a paved walkway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side door.  40 F.3d, at 862.  On appeal, the defendant argued that the officers violated his
 
Fourth Amendment rights when they went to the rear side door.  The Seventh Circuit rejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door was accessible to the general public and was commonly used for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.  Ibid.  In situations where the back door of a residence is readily accessible to the general public, the court held, the
 
Fourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers approach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a principal means of access to the dwelling.  Ibid.  See also, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 997 F.2d 1273, 12791280 (CA9 1993) (If the front and back of a residence are read-ily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and parking area here, the
 
Fourth Amendment is not implicated when officers go to the back door reasonably believing itis used as a principal entrance to the dwelling); State v. Domicz, 188 N.J. 285, 302, 907 A.2d 395, 405 (2006) (when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back door for the purpose of making contact with a resident and reasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is not unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property).

            
        We do not decide today whether those cases were correctly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a knock and talk at any entrance that is open to visitors rather than only the front door.  But whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct, it was not beyond debate.  Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8) (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)).  The Third Circuit therefore erred when it held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity.

            
        The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

        When a state prisoner seeks federal habeas relief on the ground that a state court, in adjudicating a claim on the merits, misapplied federal law, a federal court may grant relief only if the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  We have emphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),

110Stat.
1214, prohibits the federal courts of appeals from rely-ing on their own precedent to conclude that a particular constitutional principle is clearly established.  See, e.g.,Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. __, __ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op. at 6).  Because the Ninth Circuit failed to comply with this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas relief to respondent Marvin Smith.
I

            
        Respondent was arrested for the murder of his wife, Minnie Smith.  On December 15, 2005, Mrs. Smith was found dead in the home she shared with respondent, and it was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to the head from a fireplace log roller.  The home appeared to have been ransacked, and valuable jewelry was missing.

            
        The State charged respondent with first-degree murder and offered substantial incriminating evidence at trial.  The prosecution presented evidence that respondent was unfaithful to his wife for many years, that his wife was threatening to divorce him, and that he told one of his former employees ... that the only way he or his wife would get out of their marriage was to die, because he was not going to give [Mrs. Smith] half of what [he] got so some other man can live off of it.  731 F.3d 859, 862863 (CA9 2013) (second alteration in original).  Respondents DNA was also found on the murder weapon, pieces of duct tape found near the body, and a burned matchstick that was found in the bedroom and that may have been used to inflict burns on the body.  See id., at 863; see also People v. Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, *1*2 (Cal. App., Dec. 8, 2010).  The missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of respondents car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll that had provided the pieces found near the body.  See 731 F.3d, at 863.  Respondents DNA was found on the duct tape in his trunk.  See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *2.  In addition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of the Smiths home appeared to have been staged.  See 731 F.3d, at 863.

            
        Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could not have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff surgery several weeks before the murder.  See ibid.  (He mounted this defense despite the fact that police had observed him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry something out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week after the murder.  See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *1.)  The defense also suggested that one of respondents former employees had committed the crime to obtain money to pay a debt he owed respondent.  See 731 F.3d, at 863.

            
        At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed to give such an instruction.  During closing argument, the prosecutor contended that respondent was physically able to wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he also informed the jury that, even if respondent had not delivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an aiding-and-abetting theory.  See id., at 864.  The jury convicted respondent of first-degree murder without specifying which theory of guilt it adopted.

            
        After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant here, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondents conviction.  The state court rejected respondents assertion that he had inadequate notice of the possibility of con-viction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.  The court ex-plained that an accusatory pleading charging a defendant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on which the prosecution intends to rely, and noted that the information charged defendant with murder in compliance with the governing statutes.  Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *6*7.  Furthermore, the court held that even if this case required greater specificity concerning the basis of defendants liability, the evidence presented at his preliminary examination provided it.  Id., at *7.  The upshot was that the information and preliminary examination testimony adequately notified defendant he could be prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.  Id., at *8.  The California Supreme Court denied respondents petition for review.

            
        Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The Magistrate Judge recommended granting relief, and the District Court summarily adopted the Magistrate Judges recommendation.

            
        The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The court acknowledged that the information charging [respondent] with first-degree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice that he could be convicted either as a principal or as an aider-and-abettor, because under California law aiding and abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as perpetrating the crime.  731 F.3d, at 868.  But the Ninth Circuit nevertheless concluded that respondents
 
Sixth Amendment and due process right to notice had been violated because it believed the prosecution (until it requested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried the case only on the theory that respondent himself had delivered the fatal blow.  See id., at 869.

            
        The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in which we have found notice constitutionally inadequate because, although the defendant was initially adequately apprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused at trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense of another.  Rather, it found the instant case to be indistinguishable from the Ninth Circuits own decision in Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F.2d 1234 (1989), which the court thought faithfully applied the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court.  731 F.3d, at 868.  The court also rejected, as an unreasonable determination of the facts,

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeals conclusion that preliminary examination testimony and the jury instructions conference put respondent on notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.  See id., at 871872.
II
A

            
        The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dispute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.  The question is therefore whether habeas relief is warranted because the State principally relied at trial on the theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal blow.

            
        Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory, the Ninth Circuits grant of habeas relief may be affirmed only if this Courts cases clearly establish that a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a possibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate notice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another theory of liability at trial.  The Ninth Circuit pointed to no case of ours holding as much.  Instead, the Court of Appeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more than the general proposition that a defendant must have adequate notice of the charges against him.  See 731 F.3d, at 866867 (citing Russell v. United States,

369 U.S. 749
764 (1962); Inre Oliver,

333 U.S. 257
274 (1948); Cole v. Arkansas,

333 U.S. 196,
201 (1948)
).

            
        This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly the specific rule respondent needs.  We have before cautioned the lower courtsand the Ninth Circuit in particularagainst framing our precedents at such a high level of generality.  Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7).  None of our decisions that the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the specific question presented by this case.  See Russell, supra, at 752 (indictment for refus[ing] to answer any question pertinent to [a] question under [congressional] inquiry,

2 U.S.C. 192, failed to identify the subject under congressional subcommittee inquiry); Inre Oliver, supra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and sentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice of charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of criminal convictions under a ... statute for violation of which [defendants] had not been charged).[1]

            
        Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal proposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the Ninth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own decision in Sheppard, supra.  Of course, AEDPA permits habeas relief only if a state courts decision is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by this Court, not by the courts of appeals.

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  The Ninth Circuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that Sheppard faithfully applied the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.  731 F.3d, at 868.  But Circuit precedent cannot refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not announced.  Marshall, 569 U.S., at __ (slip op., at 6).  Sheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this case: whether our case law clearly establishes that a prosecutors focus on one theory of liability at trial can render earlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.
B

            
        The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed the state courts determination of the factsprincipally, the state courts holding that preliminary examination testimony and the prosecutors request for an aiding-and-abetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments adequately put respondent on notice of the prosecutions aiding-and-abetting theory.  731 F.3d, at 871 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Ninth Circuit therefore granted relief under 2254(d)(2), which permits habeas relief where the state-court decision ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  That holding cannot be sustained.

            
        In purporting to reject the state courts determination of the facts, the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary examination testimony by an investigator about conversations between respondent and his cellmate.  According to the investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told him that respondent had to get rid of his wife because she was standing in the way of his future plans; that she was threatening to divorce him and he wasnt going to give up half of his property; that respondent made his house look like the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he left for work the morning of the murder, he left the window open and did not set the alarm.  Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *7.  The investigator also testified that the cellmate did not know any of the details of the homicide itself and how it was carried out, and that respondent never told [the cellmate] specifically who committed the homicide.  Ibid.  The California Court of Appeal held that these statements, taken together, suggested that respondent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but that the fatal blow might have been delivered by an accomplice.  Ibid.  Thus, the California court believed that even assuming that the information by itself was not sufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent even greater notice of such a possibility.  Ibid.

The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions conference, which occurred after the defense rested but before the parties closing arguments.  During that conference, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, which further provided notice to respondent.  The California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is distinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F.2d 1234, because, unlike that case, the conference here did not occur immediately before closing arguments.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that because defense counsel had only the lunch recess to formulate a response to the aiding-and-abetting instruction, this case is indistinguishable from Sheppard, where the prosecution also requested the new instruction the same day as closing.  731 F.3d, at 868, 870.

            
        Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement with the state court was factual in nature, in reality its grant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the adequacy of the notice provided.  The Ninth Circuit believed that the events detailed above, even when taken together with the information filed against respondent, failed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in cases like this.  That ranked as a legal determination governed by 2254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by 2254(d)(2).  But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit cited only its own precedent for establishing the appropriate standard.  Absent a decision of ours clearly establishing the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing against which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice afforded respondent by the information and proceedings.  It therefore had no basis to reject the state courts assessment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-sibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.[2]

            
        The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

			In 2005, Smiths wife was killed at home by a blow to the head from a log roller. The home appeared to have been ransacked. Jewelry was missing. Smith was charged with first-degree murder. The prosecution presented evidence that he was unfaithful for many years, that his wife was threatening a divorce, and that he told an employee that the only way  out of their marriage was to die. Smiths DNA was found on the murder weapon, duct tape found near the body, and a matchstick that may have been used to burn the body. The missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of Smiths car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll as pieces found near the body. Smith claimed that he could not have delivered the fatal blow due to surgery weeks before the murder. The prosecution successfully requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction and argued that even if he had not delivered the fatal blow, he could be convicted. The jury did not specify which theory it adopted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, rejecting an assertion that Smith had inadequate notice of the aiding-and-abetting theory. The California Supreme Court denied his petition for review. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts grant of habeas relief, stating that the information charging first degree murder was initially sufficient, because under California law, aiding and abetting is the same substantive offense as perpetrating the crime, but that  Smiths Sixth Amendment and due process right to notice were violated because the prosecution (until it sought an aiding-and-abetting instruction) had tried the case on the theory that Smith himself had delivered the fatal blow. The Supreme Court reversed. When a state prisoner seeks federal habeas relief on the ground that a state court, in adjudicating a claim on the merits, misapplied federal law, a federal court may grant relief only if the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, 28 U. S. C. 2254(d)(1). The Ninth Circuit relied only on its own precedent in this case.

HARRIS etal. v. QUINN, GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 11681.Argued January 21, 2014Decided June 30, 2014
Illinois Home Services Program (Rehabilitation Program) allows Medicaid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a personal assistant (PA) to provide homecare services.  Under State law, the homecare recipients (designated customers) and the State both play some role in the employment relationship with the PAs.  Customers control most aspects of the employment relationship, including the hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of PAs; they also define the PAs duties by proposing a Service Plan.  Other than compensating PAs, the States involvement in employment matters is minimal.  Its employer status was created by executive order, and later codified by the legislature, solely to permit PAs to join a labor union and engage in collective bargaining under Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA).  

        
        
        
        Pursuant to this scheme, respondent SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana (SEIUHII) was designated the exclusive union representative for Rehabilitation Program employees.  The union entered into collective-bargaining agreements with the State that contained an agency-fee provision, which requires all bargaining unit members who do not wish to join the union to pay the union a fee for the cost of certain activities, including those tied to the collective-bargaining process.  A group of Rehabilitation Program PAs brought a class action against SEIUHII and other respondents in Federal District Court, claiming that the PLRA violated the
 
First Amendment insofar as it authorized the agency-fee provision.  The District Court dismissed their claims, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part, concluding that the PAs were state employees within the meaning of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,

431 U.S. 209
.
Held:The
 
First Amendment prohibits the collection of an agency fee from Rehabilitation Program PAs who do not want to join or support the union.  Pp.840.

        
        (a)In upholding the Illinois laws constitutionality, the Seventh Circuit relied on Abood, which, in turn, relied on Railway Employes v. Hanson,

351 U.S. 225
, and Machinists v. Street,

367 U.S. 740
.  Unlike Abood, those cases involved private-sector collective-bargaining agreements.  The Abood Court treated the
 
First Amendment issue as largely settled by Hanson and Street and understood those cases to have upheld agency fees based on the desirability of labor peace and the problem of free riders[hip].  431 U.S., 220222, 224.  However, preventing nonmembers from free-riding on the unions efforts is a rationale generally insufficient to overcome
 
First Amendment objections, Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U.S. ___, ___, and in this respect, Abood is something of an anomaly, 567 U.S., at ___.

        
        The Abood Courts analysis is questionable on several grounds.  The
 
First Amendment analysis in Hanson was thin, and Street was not a constitutional decision.  And the Court fundamentally misunderstood Hansons narrow holding, which upheld the authorization, not imposition, of an agency fee.  The Abood Court also failed to appreciate the distinction between core union speech in the public sector and core union speech in the private sector, as well as the conceptual difficulty in public-sector cases of distinguishing union expenditures for collective bargaining from those designed for political purposes.  Nor does the Abood Court seem to have anticipated the administrative problems that would result in attempting to classify union expenditures as either chargeable or nonchargeable, see, e.g., Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn.,

500 U.S. 507
, or the practical problems that would arise from the heavy burden facing objecting nonmembers wishing to challenge the unions actions.  Finally, the Abood Courts critical labor peace analysis rests on the unsupported empirical assumption that exclusive representation in the public sector depends on the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers.  Pp.820.

        
        (b)Because of Aboods questionable foundations, and because Illinois PAs are quite different from full-fledged public employees, this Court refuses to extend Abood to the situation here.  Pp.2029.

        
        
        
        (1)PAs are much different from public employees.  Unlike full-fledged public employees, PAs are almost entirely answerable to the customers and not to the State, do not enjoy most of the rights and benefits that inure to state employees, and are not indemnified by the State for claims against them arising from actions taken during the course of their employment.  Even the scope of collective bargaining on their behalf is sharply limited.  Pp.2025.

        
        
        
        (2)Aboods rationale is based on the assumption that the union possesses the full scope of powers and duties generally available under American labor law.  Even the best argument for Aboods anomalous approach is a poor fit here.  What justifies the agency fee in the Abood context is the fact that the State compels the union to promote and protect the interests of nonmembers in negotiating and administering a collective-bargaining agreement and representing the interests of employees in settling disputes and processing grievances.  Lehnert, supra, at 556.  That rationale has little application here, where Illinois law requires that all PAs receive the same rate of pay and the union has no authority with respect to a PAs grievances against a customer.  Pp.2527.

        
        
        
        (3)Extending Aboods boundaries to encompass partial public employees would invite problems.  State regulations and benefits affecting such employees exist along a continuum, and it is unclear at what point, short of full-fledged public employment, Abood should apply.  Under respondents view, a host of workers who currently receive payments from a government entity for some sort of service would become candidates for inclusion within Aboods reach, and it would be hard to see where to draw the line.  Pp.2729.

        
        (c)Because Abood does not control here, generally applicable
 
First Amendment standards apply.  Thus, the agency-fee provision here must serve a compelling state interes[t] ... that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.  Knox, supra, at ___.  None of the interests that respondents contend are furthered by the agency-fee provision is sufficient.  Pp.2934.

        
        
        
        (1)Their claim that the agency-fee provision promotes labor peace misses the point.  Petitioners do not contend that they have a
 
First Amendment right to form a rival union or that SEIUHII has no authority to serve as the exclusive bargaining representative.  This, along with examples from some federal agencies and many state laws, demonstrates that a unions status as exclusive bargaining agent and the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers are not inextricably linked.  Features of the Illinois schemee.g., PAs do not work together in a common state facility and the unions role is very restrictedfurther undermine the labor peace argument.  Pp.3132.

        
        
        
        (2)Respondents also argue that the agency-fee provision promotes the welfare of PAs, thereby contributing to the Rehabilitation Programs success.  Even assuming that SEIUHII has been an effective advocate, the agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless the union could not adequately advocate without the receipt of nonmember agency fees.  No such showing has been made.  Pp.3234.

        
        (d)Respondents additional arguments for sustaining the Illinois scheme are unconvincing.  First, they urge the application of a balancing test derived from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,

391 U.S. 563
.  This Court has never viewed Abood and its progeny as based on Pickering balancing.  And even assuming that Pickering applies, that cases balancing test clearly tips in favor of the objecting employees
 
First Amendment interests.  Second, respondents err in contending that a refusal to extend Abood here will call into question this Courts decisions in Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,

496 U.S. 1
, and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,

529 U.S. 217
, for those decisions fit comfortably within the framework applied here.  Pp.3440.
656 F.3d 692, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.

        
        Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

That rationale has little application here, where Illinois law requires that all PAs receive the same rate of pay and the union has no authority with respect to a PAs grievances against a customer.  Pp.2527.

        
        
        
        (3)Extending Aboods boundaries to encompass partial public employees would invite problems.  State regulations and benefits affecting such employees exist along a continuum, and it is unclear at what point, short of full-fledged public employment, Abood should apply.  Under respondents view, a host of workers who currently receive payments from a government entity for some sort of service would become candidates for inclusion within Aboods reach, and it would be hard to see where to draw the line.  Pp.2729.

        
        (c)Because Abood does not control here, generally applicable
 
First Amendment standards apply.  Thus, the agency-fee provision here must serve a compelling state interes[t] ... that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.  Knox, supra, at ___.  None of the interests that respondents contend are furthered by the agency-fee provision is sufficient.  Pp.2934.

        
        
        
        (1)Their claim that the agency-fee provision promotes labor peace misses the point.  Petitioners do not contend that they have a
 
First Amendment right to form a rival union or that SEIUHII has no authority to serve as the exclusive bargaining representative.  This, along with examples from some federal agencies and many state laws, demonstrates that a unions status as exclusive bargaining agent and the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers are not inextricably linked.  Features of the Illinois schemee.g., PAs do not work together in a common state facility and the unions role is very restrictedfurther undermine the labor peace argument.  Pp.3132.

        
        
        
        (2)Respondents also argue that the agency-fee provision promotes the welfare of PAs, thereby contributing to the Rehabilitation Programs success.  Even assuming that SEIUHII has been an effective advocate, the agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless the union could not adequately advocate without the receipt of nonmember agency fees.  No such showing has been made.  Pp.3234.

        
        (d)Respondents additional arguments for sustaining the Illinois scheme are unconvincing.  First, they urge the application of a balancing test derived from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,

391 U.S. 563
.  This Court has never viewed Abood and its progeny as based on Pickering balancing.  And even assuming that Pickering applies, that cases balancing test clearly tips in favor of the objecting employees
 
First Amendment interests.  Second, respondents err in contending that a refusal to extend Abood here will call into question this Courts decisions in Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,

496 U.S. 1
, and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,

529 U.S. 217
, for those decisions fit comfortably within the framework applied here.  Pp.3440.

        Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Kagan, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined."|"
			Illinois Home Services Rehabilitation Program allows Medicaid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a personal assistant (PA) to provide homecare. Under state law, homecare customers control hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of Pas and define the PAs duties in a Service Plan. Other than compensating PAs, the states role is minimal. Its employer status was created by executive order, solely to permit PAs to join a labor union and engage in collective bargaining under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA). SEIUHII was designated the exclusive union representative and entered into collective-bargaining agreements with the state that contained an agency-fee provision, which requires all bargaining unit members who do not wish to join the union to pay the cost of certain activities, including those tied to collective-bargaining.  PAs brought a class action, claiming that the PLRA violated the First Amendment by authorizing the agency-fee provision. The district court dismissed. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the PAs were state employees.  The Supreme Court reversed in part. Preventing nonmembers from free-riding on union efforts is generally insufficient to overcome First Amendment objections. Noting its questionable foundations and that Illinois PAs are quite different from full-fledged public employees, the Court refused to extend the 1977 holding, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., which was based on the assumption that the union possessed the full scope of powers and duties available under labor law. The PA union has few powers and duties.   PAs are almost entirely answerable to customers, not to the state. They do not have most of the rights and benefits of state employees, and are not indemnified by the state for claims arising from actions taken in the course of employment. The scope of collective bargaining on their behalf is very limited. PAs receive the same rate of pay and the union has no authority with respect to grievances against a customer. Because Abood does not control, generally applicable First Amendment standards apply and the agency-fee provision must serve a compelling state interes[t] ... that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.  None of the cited interests in labor peace or effective advocacy are sufficient.

Syllabus
BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, etal. v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 13354.Argued March 25, 2014Decided June 30, 2014[1]
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a persons exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the Government demonstrates that application of the burden to the person(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.  42 U.S.C.2000bb1(a), (b).  As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.  2000cc5(7)(A).

        
        
        
        At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires specified employers group health plans to furnish preventive care and screenings for women without any cost sharing requirements,

42 U.S.C. 300gg13(a)(4).  Congress did not specify what types of preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide.  Ibid.  Nonexempt employers are generally required to provide coverage for the 20 contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.  Religious employers, such as churches, are exempt from this contraceptive mandate.  HHS has also effectively exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  Under this accommodation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage from the employers plan and provide plan participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. 

        
        
        
        In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point.  In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.  In No. 13356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their companyConestoga Wood Specialtiesa preliminary injunction.  Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not engage in religious exercise under RFRA or the
 
First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity.  In No. 13354, the Greens, their children, and their companiesHobby Lobby Stores and Mardelwere also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  It held that the Greens businesses are persons under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. 
Held:As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA.  Pp.1649.

        
        (a)RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel.  Pp.1631.

        
        
        
        (1)HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave merchants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as corporations.  RFRAs text shows that Congress designed the statute to provide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend to put merchants to such a choice.  It employed the familiar legal fiction of including corporations within RFRAs definition of persons, but the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of people associated with the corporation, including shareholders, officers, and employees.  Protecting the free-exercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them.  Pp.1619.

        
        
        
        (2)HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments.  Pp.1931.

        
        
        
        
        
        (i)Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition of person, which include[s] corporations,... as well as individuals.

1 U.S.C. 1.  The Court has entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit corporations.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Esprita Beneficiente Unio do Vegetal,

546 U.S. 418
.  And HHSs concession that a nonprofit corporation can be a person under RFRA effectively dispatches any argument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no conceivable definition of person includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations.  Pp.1920.

        
        
        
        
        
        (ii)HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does not cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot exercise ... religion.  They offer no persuasive explanation for this conclusion.  The corporate form alone cannot explain it because RFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations.  And the profit-making objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the Court has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants.  Braunfeld v. Brown,

366 U.S. 599
.  Business practices compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understanding of the exercise of religion that this Court set out in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,

494 U.S. 872
.  Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law.  States, including those in which the plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations to pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners religious principles.  Pp.2025.

        
        
        
        
        
        (iii)Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection because it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents, none of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit corporations.  First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested that its definition of exercise of religion was meant to be tied to pre-Smith interpretations of the
 
First Amendment.  Second, if RFRAs original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of the phrase from that in
 
First Amendment case law.  Third, the pre-Smith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,

366 U.S. 617
, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can exercise religion.  Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely restored this Courts pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and restricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plaintiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith.  Pp.2528.

        
        
        
        (3)Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of ascertaining the beliefs of large, publicly traded corporations, but HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRAs protection.  That disputes among the owners of corporations might arise is not a problem unique to this context.  State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure.  Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.  Pp.2931.

        
        (b)HHSs contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion.  Pp.3138.

        
        
        
        (1)It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at conception.  If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and $15 million per year for Mardel.  And if they drop coverage altogether, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.  P.32.

        
        
        
        (2)Amici supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substantial burden imposed by the mandate.  HHS has never argued this and the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.  But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive:  It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty.  Pp.3235.

        
        
        
        (3)HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage and contraceptive method she uses.  But RFRAs question is whether the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties ability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.  It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable.  In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly identical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,

450 U.S. 707
.  The Courts narrow function ... is to determine whether the plaintiffs asserted religious belief reflects an honest conviction, id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it does.  Tilton v. Richardson,

403 U.S. 672
; and Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,

392 U.S. 236
249, distinguished.  Pp.3538.

        
        (c)The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling governmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.  Pp.3849.

        
        
        
        (1)The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA.  Pp.3940.

        
        
        
        (2)The Government has failed to satisfy RFRAs least-restrictive-means standard.  HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion.  The Government could, e.g., assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable to obtain coverage due to their employers religious objections.  Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.  That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHSs stated interests.  Pp.4045.

        
        
        
        (3)This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employers religious beliefs.  Nor does it provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.  United States v. Lee,

455 U.S. 252
, which upheld the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employers religious objection, is not analogous.  It turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.  Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.  Pp.4549.

But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive:  It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty.  Pp.3235.

        
        
        
        (3)HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage and contraceptive method she uses.  But RFRAs question is whether the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties ability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.  It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable.  In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly identical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,

450 U.S. 707
.  The Courts narrow function ... is to determine whether the plaintiffs asserted religious belief reflects an honest conviction, id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it does.  Tilton v. Richardson,

; and Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,

392 U.S. 236
249, distinguished.  Pp.3538.

        
        (c)The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling governmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.  Pp.3849.

        
        
        
        (1)The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA.  Pp.3940.

        
        
        
        (2)The Government has failed to satisfy RFRAs least-restrictive-means standard.  HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion.  The Government could, e.g., assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable to obtain coverage due to their employers religious objections.  Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.  That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHSs stated interests.  Pp.4045.

        
        
        
        (3)This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employers religious beliefs.  Nor does it provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.  United States v. Lee,

455 U.S. 252
, which upheld the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employers religious objection, is not analogous.  It turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.  Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.  Pp.4549.

			Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations implementing the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) require that employers group health plans furnish preventive care and screenings for women without cost sharing requirements, 42 U.S.C. 300gg13(a)(4). Nonexempt employers must provide coverage for 20 FDA-approved contraceptive methods, including four that may have the effect of preventing a fertilized egg from developing. Religious employers, such as churches, are exempt from the contraceptive mandate. HHS has effectively exempted religious nonprofit organizations; an insurer must exclude contraceptive coverage from such an employers plan and provide participants with separate payments for contraceptive services. Closely held for-profit corporations sought an injunction under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the government from substantially burdening a persons exercise of religion even by a rule of general applicability unless it demonstrates that imposing the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb1(a), (b).  As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief. The Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not engage in religious exercise under RFRA and that the mandate imposed no requirements on corporate owners in their personal capacity. The Tenth Circuit held that the businesses are persons under RFRA; that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their religious exercise; and that HHS had not demonstrated that the mandate was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the businesses, holding that RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations. The Court declined to leave merchants with a difficult choice of giving up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgoing the benefits of operating as corporations. Nothing in RFRA suggests intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition of person, which includes corporations, 1 U.S.C.1; no definition of person includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but excludes for-profit corporations. Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law. The Court rejected arguments based on the difficulty of ascertaining the beliefs of large, publicly traded corporations and that the mandate itself requires only insurance coverage. If the plaintiff companies refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, they face severe economic consequences; the government failed to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods. The government could assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives or could extend the accommodation already established for religious nonprofit organizations. The Court noted that its decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate, not all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
McCULLEN etal. v. COAKLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 121168.Argued January 15, 2014Decided June 26, 2014
In 2007, Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, which had been enacted in 2000 to address clashes between abortion opponents and advocates of abortion rights outside clinics where abortions were performed.  The amended version of the Act makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a public way or sidewalk within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any reproductive health care facility, defined as a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, 120E(a), (b).  The Act exempts from this prohibition four classes of individuals, including employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment.  120E(b)(2).  Another provision of the Act proscribes the knowing obstruction of access to an abortion clinic.  120E(e).

        
        
        
        McCullen and the other petitioners are individuals who attempt to engage women approaching Massachusetts abortion clinics in sidewalk counseling, which involves offering information about alternatives to abortion and help pursuing those options.  They claim that the 35-foot buffer zones have displaced them from their previous positions outside the clinics, considerably hampering their counseling efforts.  Their attempts to communicate with patients are further thwarted, they claim, by clinic escorts, who accompany arriving patients through the buffer zones to the clinic entrances.  

        
        
        
        Petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Commonwealth officials, seeking to enjoin the Acts enforcement on the ground that it violates the First and
 
Fourteenth Amendments, both on its face and as applied to them.  The District Court denied both challenges, and the First Circuit affirmed.  With regard to petitioners facial challenge, the First Circuit held that the Act was a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation under the test set forth in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,

491 U.S. 781
.  
Held:The Massachusetts Act violates the
 
First Amendment.  Pp.830.

        
        (a)By its very terms, the Act restricts access to public way[s] and sidewalk[s], places that have traditionally been open for speech activities and that the Court has accordingly labeled traditional public fora, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,

555 U.S. 460
.  The governments ability to regulate speech in such locations is very limited.  United States v. Grace,

461 U.S. 171
, 177.  [E]ven in a public forum, however, the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information, Ward, supra, at 791.  Pp.810.

        
        (b)Because the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based, it need not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.  Pp.1018.

        
        
        
        (1)The Act is not content based simply because it establishes buffer zones only at abortion clinics, as opposed to other kinds of facilities.  First, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its face.  Whether petitioners violate the Act depends not on what they say, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,

561 U.S. 1
, but on where they say it.  Second, even if a facially neutral law disproportionately affects speech on certain topics, it remains content neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.  Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,

475 U.S. 41
.  The Acts purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to healthcare, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets.  The Court has previously deemed all these concerns to be content neutral.  See Boos v. Barry,

485 U.S. 312
.  An intent to single out for regulation speech about abortion cannot be inferred from the Acts limited scope.  States adopt laws to address the problems that confront them.  Burson v. Freeman,

504 U.S. 191
.  There was a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics but not at other kinds of facilities in the Commonwealth.  Pp.1115.

        
        
        
        (2)The Acts exemption for clinic employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment does not appear to be an attempt to favor one viewpoint about abortion over the other.  City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

512 U.S. 43
, distinguished.  Given that some kind of exemption was necessary to allow individuals who work at the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones, the scope of employment qualification simply ensures that the exemption is limited to its purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs.  Even assuming that some clinic escorts have expressed their views on abortion inside the zones, the record does not suggest that such speech was within the scope of the escorts employment.  If it turned out that a particular clinic authorized its employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones, that would support an as-applied challenge to the zones at that clinic.  Pp.1518.  

        
        (c)Although the Act is content neutral, it is not narrowly tailored because it burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governments legitimate interests.  Ward, 491 U.S., at 799.  Pp.1829.  

        
        
        
        (1)The buffer zones serve the Commonwealths legitimate interests in maintaining public safety on streets and sidewalks and in preserving access to adjacent reproductive healthcare facilities.  See Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N.Y.,

519 U.S. 357
.  At the same time, however, they impose serious burdens on petitioners speech, depriving them of their two primary methods of communicating with arriving patients: close, personal conversations and distribution of literature.  Those forms of expression have historically been closely associated with the transmission of ideas.  While the Act may allow petitioners to protest outside the buffer zones, petitioners are not protestors; they seek not merely to express their opposition to abortion, but to engage in personal, caring, consensual conversations with women about various alternatives.  It is thus no answer to say that petitioners can still be seen and heard by women within the buffer zones.  If all that the women can see and hear are vociferous opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively stifled petitioners message.  Pp.1923.

        
        
        
        (2)The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the Commonwealths asserted interests.  Subsection (e) of the Act already prohibits deliberate obstruction of clinic entrances.  Massachusetts could also enact legislation similar to the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994,

18 U.S.C. 248(a)(1), which imposes criminal and civil sanctions for obstructing, intimidating, or interfering with persons obtaining or providing reproductive health services.  Obstruction of clinic driveways can readily be addressed through existing local traffic ordinances.  While the Commonwealth contends that individuals can inadvertently obstruct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that problem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do so by the police.  In any event, crowding appears to be a problem only at the Boston clinic, and even there, only on Saturday mornings.

        
        The Commonwealth has not shown that it seriously undertook to address these various problems with the less intrusive tools readily available to it.  It identifies not a single prosecution or injunction against individuals outside abortion clinics since the 1990s.  The Commonwealth responds that the problems are too widespread for individual prosecutions and injunctions to be effective.  But again, the record indicates that the problems are limited principally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings, and the police there appear perfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers.  The Commonwealth also claims that it would be difficult to prove intentional or deliberate obstruction or intimidation and that the buffer zones accordingly make the polices job easier.  To meet the narrow tailoring requirement, however, the government must demonstrate that alternative measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to achieve the governments interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier.  In any event, to determine whether someone intends to block access to a clinic, a police officer need only order him to move; if he refuses, then there is no question that his continued conduct is knowing or intentional.  For similar reasons, the Commonwealths reliance on Burson v. Freeman,

504 U.S. 191
, is misplaced.  There, the Court upheld a law establishing buffer zones outside polling places on the ground that less restrictive measures were inadequate.  But whereas [v]oter intimidation and election fraud are difficult to detect, id., at 208, obstruction and harassment at abortion clinics are anything but subtle.  And while the police generally are barred from the vicinity of the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the electoral process, id., at 207, they maintain a significant presence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics.  In short, given the vital
 
First Amendment interests at stake, it is not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that other approaches have not worked.  Pp. 2329.
708 F.3d 1, reversed and remanded.

        
        Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

			Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act to make it a crime to knowingly stand on a public way or sidewalk within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any reproductive health care facility, defined as a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed. Mass. Gen. Laws, 266, 120E. Exemptions cover employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment. Another provision proscribes knowing obstruction of access to an abortion clinic. Abortion opponents who engage in sidewalk counseling sought an injunction, claiming that the amendment displaced them from their previous positions and hampered their counseling efforts; attempts to communicate with patients are also thwarted by clinic escorts, who accompany patients to clinic entrances. The district court denied the challenges. The First Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed, first noting the involvement of a traditional public forum.  The Court employed time, place, and manner analysis, stating that the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based and need not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.  Although it establishes buffer zones only at abortion clinics, violations depend not on what they say, but on where they say it.  The Act is justified without reference to the content of speech; its purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to health care, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets. There was a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics but not at other facilities. The exemption for employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment was not an attempt to favor one viewpoint. Even if some escorts have expressed views on abortion inside the zones, there was no evidence that such speech was authorized by any clinic.  The Act, however, burdens substantially more speech than necessary to further the governments legitimate interests.  It deprives objectors of their primary methods of communicating with patients: close, personal conversations and distribution of literature.

Invoking the Recess Appointments Clausewhich gives the President the power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, Art.II, 2, cl.3the President appointed the three members in question between the January 3 and January 6 proforma sessions.  Noel Canning argued primarily that the appointments were invalid because the 3-day adjournment between those two sessions was not long enough to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause.  The D.C. Circuit agreed that the appointments fell outside the scope of the Clause, but on different grounds.  It held that the phrase the recess, as used in the Clause, does not include intra-session recesses, and that the phrase vacancies that may happen during the recess applies only to vacancies that first come into existence during a recess.
Held:

        
        1.The Recess Appointments Clause empowers the President to fill any existing vacancy during any recessintra-session or inter-sessionof sufficient length.  Pp.533.

        
        
        
        (a)Two background considerations are relevant to the questions here.  First, the Recess Appointments Clause is a subsidiary method for appointing officers of the United States.  The Founders intended the norm to be the method of appointment in Article II, 2, cl. 2, which requires Senate approval of Presidential nominations, at least for principal officers.  The Recess Appointments Clause reflects the tension between the Presidents continuous need for the assistance of subordinates, Myers v. United States,

272 U.S. 52
, and the Senates early practice of meeting for a single brief session each year.  The Clause should be interpreted as granting the President the power to make appointments during a recess but not offering the President the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation.

        
        Second, in interpreting the Clause, the Court puts significant weight upon historical practice.  The longstanding practice of the government, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401, can inform this Courts determination of what the law is in a separation-of-powers case, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176.  See also, e.g., Mistretta v. United States,

488 U.S. 361
; The Pocket Veto Case,

279 U.S. 655
690.  There is a great deal of history to consider here, for Presidents have made recess appointments since the beginning of the Republic.  Their frequency suggests that the Senate and President have recognized that such appointments can be both necessary and appropriate in certain circumstances.  The Court, in interpreting the Clause for the first time, must hesitate to upset the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of Government themselves have reached.  Pp.59.

        
        
        
        (b)The phrase the recess of the Senate applies to both inter-session recess (i.e., breaks between formal sessions of the Senate) and intra-session recesses (i.e., breaks in the midst of a formal session) of substantial length.  The constitutional text is ambiguous.  Founding-era dictionaries and usages show that the phrase the recess can encompass intra-session breaks.  And this broader interpretation is demanded by the purpose of the Clause, which is to allow the President to make appointments so as to ensure the continued functioning of the Government while the Senate is away.  The Senate is equally away and unavailable to participate in the appointments process during both an inter-session and an intra-session recess.  History offers further support for this interpretation.  From the founding until the Great Depression, every time the Senate took a substantial, non-holiday intra-session recess, the President made recess appointments.  President Andrew Johnson made the first documented intra-session recess appointments in 1867 and 1868, and Presidents made similar appointments in 1921 and 1929.  Since 1929, and particularly since the end of World War II, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks and taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks; Presidents accordingly have made more intra-session recess appointments.  Meanwhile, the Senate has never taken any formal action to deny the validity of intra-session recess appointments.  In 1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined the recess as the period of time when the Senate is absent and cannot participate as a body in making appointments, S. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., p.2, and that functional definition encompasses both intra-session and inter-session recesses.  A 1940 law regulating the payment of recess appointees has also been interpreted functionally by the Comptroller General (an officer of the Legislative Branch).  In sum, Presidents have made intra-session recess appointments for a century and a half, and the Senate has never taken formal action to oppose them.  That practice is long enough to entitle it to great weight in a proper interpretation of the constitutional provision.  The Pocket Veto Case, supra, at 689.

        
        The Clause does not say how long a recess must be in order to fall within the Clause, but even the Solicitor General concedes that a 3-day recess would be too short.  The Adjournments Clause, Art.I, 5, cl.4, reflects the fact that a 3-day break is not a significant interruption of legislative business.  A Senate recess that is so short that it does not require the consent of the House under that Clause is not long enough to trigger the Presidents recess-appointment power.  Moreover, the Court has not found a single example of a recess appointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than 10 days.  There are a few examples of inter-session recess appointments made during recesses of less than 10 days, but these are anomalies.  In light of historical practice, a recess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within the Clause.  The word presumptively leaves open the possibility that a very unusual circumstance could demand the exercise of the recess-appointment power during a shorter break.  Pp.921.

        
        
        
        (c)The phrase vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, Art.II, 2, cl.3, applies both to vacancies that first come into existence during a recess and to vacancies that initially occur before a recess but continue to exist during the recess.  Again, the text is ambiguous.  As Thomas Jefferson observed, the Clause is certainly susceptible of [two] constructions.  Letter to Wilson Cary Nicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433.  It may mean vacancies that may happen to be or may happen to fall during a recess.  Ibid.  And, as Attorney General Wirt wrote in 1821, the broader reading is more consonant with the reason and spirit of the Clause.  1 Op. Atty. Gen. 632.  The purpose of the Clause is to permit the President, who is always acting to execute the law, to obtain the assistance of subordinate officers while the Senate, which acts only in intervals, is unavailable to confirm them.  If a vacancy arises too late in the session for the President and Senate to have an opportunity to select a replacement, the narrower reading could paralyze important functions of the Federal Government, particularly at the time of the founding.  The broader interpretation ensures that offices needing to be filled can be filled.  It does raise a danger that the President may attempt to use the recess-appointment power to circumvent the Senates advice and consent role.  But the narrower interpretation risks undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and more often.  It would prevent a President from making any recess appointment to fill a vacancy that arose before a recess, no matter who the official, how dire the need, how uncontroversial the appointment, and how late in the session the office fell vacant.

        
        Historical practice also strongly favors the broader interpretation.  The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at least to President Madison.  Nearly every Attorney General to consider the question has approved the practice, and every President since James Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre-existing vacancies.  It is a fair inference from the historical data that a large proportion of recess appointments over our Nations history have filled pre-recess vacancies.  The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1863 did issue a report disagreeing with the broader interpretation, and Congress passed a law known as the Pay Act prohibiting payment of recess appointments to pre-recess vacancies soon after.  However, the Senate subsequently abandoned its hostility.  In 1940, the Senate amended the Pay Act to permit payment of recess appointees in circumstances that would be unconstitutional under the narrower interpretation.  In short, Presidents have made recess appointments to preexisting vacancies for two centuries, and the Senate as a body has not countered this practice for nearly three-quarters of a century, perhaps longer.  The Court is reluctant to upset this traditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presidents have believed existed and have exercised for so long.  Pp.2133.

        
        2. For purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.

        
        This standard is consistent with the Constitutions broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business, as recognized by this Courts precedents.  See Art. I, 5, cl. 2; Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark,

143 U. S. 649
; United States v. Ballin,

144 U. S. 1
.  Although the Senates own determination of when it is and is not in session should be given great weight, the Courts deference cannot be absolute.  When the Senate is without the capacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even if it so declares.

        
        Under the standard set forth here, the Senate was in session during the pro forma sessions at issue.  It said it was in session, and Senate rules make clear that the Senate retained the power to conduct business.  The Senate could have conducted business simply by passing a unanimous consent agreement.  In fact, it did so; it passed a bill by unanimous consent during its pro forma session on December 23, 2011.  See 2011 S. J. 924; Pub. L. 11278.  The Court will not, as the Solicitor General urges, engage in an in-depth factual appraisal of what the Senate actually did during its pro forma sessions in order to determine whether it was in recess or in session for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause.

        
        Because the Senate was in session during its proforma sessions, the President made the recess appointments at issue during a 3-day recess.  Three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the scope of the Clause, so the President lacked the authority to make those appointments.  Pp. 3341.
705 F.3d 490, affirmed.

FIFTH THIRD BANCORP etal. v. DUDENHOEFFER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 12751.Argued April 2, 2014Decided June 25, 2014
Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution retirement savings plan for its employees.  Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock.  Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP.  The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),

29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(B).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have knownon the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officersthat Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky.  It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOPs holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stocks price downward.  According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents retirement savings.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.  It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage.  The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
Held: 

        
        1.ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence.  Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the funds assets, 1104(a)(2).  This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA.  Section 1104(a)(1)(B) imposes a prudent person standard by which to measure fiduciaries investment decisions and disposition of assets.  Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,

473 U.S. 134
, n.10.  Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.  And 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that the diversification requirement of [1104(a)(1)(C)] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].  Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special presumption in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was, e.g., on the brink of collapse.  It simply modifies the duties imposed by 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way.  Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries.  Pp.415.

        
        2.On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662
680, and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544
563, in light of the following considerations.  Pp.1520.

        
        
        
        (a)Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal.  Pp.1618.

        
        
        
        (b)To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.  Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points.  First, ERISAs duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws.  Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside infor-mation, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws.  Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendants position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.  Pp.1820.
692 F. 3d 410, vacated and remanded.

        
        Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

FIFTH THIRD BANCORP etal. v. DUDENHOEFFER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 12751.Argued April 2, 2014Decided June 25, 2014
Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution retirement savings plan for its employees.  Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock.  Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP.  The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),

29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(B).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have knownon the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officersthat Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky.  It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOPs holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stocks price downward.  According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents retirement savings.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.  It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage.  The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
Held: 

        
        1.ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence.  Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the funds assets, 1104(a)(2).  This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA.  Section 1104(a)(1)(B) imposes a prudent person standard by which to measure fiduciaries investment decisions and disposition of assets.  Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,

473 U.S. 134
, n.10.  Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.  And 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that the diversification requirement of [1104(a)(1)(C)] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [1104(a)(1)(B)] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].  Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special presumption in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was, e.g., on the brink of collapse.  It simply modifies the duties imposed by 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way.  Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries.  Pp.415.

        
        2.On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662
680, and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544
563, in light of the following considerations.  Pp.1520.

        
        
        
        (a)Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal.  Pp.1618.

        
        
        
        (b)To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.  Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points.  First, ERISAs duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws.  Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside infor-mation, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws.  Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendants position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.  Pp.1820.
692 F. 3d 410, vacated and remanded.

        
        Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."|"
			Fifth Third maintains a defined-contribution retirement savings plan for its employees. Participants may direct their contributions into any of several investment options, including an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which invests primarily in Fifth Third stock. Former participants sued, alleging breach of the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(B) in that the defendants should have knownon the basis of both public information and inside information available to Fifth Third officersthat the stock was overpriced and risky. The price of Fifth Third stock fell, reducing plaintiffs retirement savings. The district court dismissed; the Sixth Circuit reversed. A unanimous Supreme Court vacated. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence, but are subject to the same duty that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the funds assets. There is no requirement that plaintiffs allege that the employer was,  for example, on the brink of collapse.  Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized, on the basis of publicly available information, that the market was over- or under-valuing the stock are generally implausible and insufficient to state a claim. To state a claim, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that could have been taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. ERISAs duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell in violation of insider trading laws. An allegation that fiduciaries failed to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or failed to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, requires courts to consider possible conflicts with complex insider trading and corporate disclosure laws. Courts confronted with such claims must also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the same position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund.

RILEY v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, fourth appellate district, division one
No. 13132.Argued April 29, 2014Decided June 25, 2014[1]
In No. 13132, petitioner Riley was stopped for a traffic violation, which eventually led to his arrest on weapons charges.  An officer searching Riley incident to the arrest seized a cell phone from Rileys pants pocket.  The officer accessed information on the phone and noticed the repeated use of a term associated with a street gang.  At the police station two hours later, a detective specializing in gangs further examined the phones digital contents.  Based in part on photographs and videos that the detective found, the State charged Riley in connection with a shooting that had occurred a few weeks earlier and sought an enhanced sentence based on Rileys gang membership.  Riley moved to suppress all evidence that the police had obtained from his cell phone.  The trial court denied the motion, and Riley was convicted.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  

        
        
        
        In No. 13212, respondent Wurie was arrested after police observed him participate in an apparent drug sale.  At the police station, the officers seized a cell phone from Wuries person and noticed that the phone was receiving multiple calls from a source identified as my house on its external screen.  The officers opened the phone, accessed its call log, determined the number associated with the my house label, and traced that number to what they suspected was Wuries apartment.  They secured a search warrant and found drugs, a firearm and ammunition, and cash in the ensuing search.  Wurie was then charged with drug and firearm offenses.  He moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment.  The District Court denied the motion, and Wurie was convicted.  The First Circuit reversed the denial of the motion to suppress and vacated the relevant convictions.
Held:The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.  Pp.528.

        
        (a)A warrantless search is reasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the
 
Fourth Amendments warrant requirement.  See Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  The well-established exception at issue here applies when a warrantless search is conducted incident to a lawful arrest.  

        
        Three related precedents govern the extent to which officers may search property found on or near an arrestee.  Chimel v. California,

395 U.S. 752
, requires that a search incident to arrest be limited to the area within the arrestees immediate control, where it is justified by the interests in officer safety and in preventing evidence destruction.  In United States v. Robinson,

414 U.S. 218
, the Court applied the Chimel analysis to a search of a cigarette pack found on the arrestees person.  It held that the risks identified in Chimel are present in all custodial arrests, 414 U.S., at 235, even when there is no specific concern about the loss of evidence or the threat to officers in a particular case, id., at 236.  The trilogy concludes with Arizona v. Gant,

556 U.S. 332
, which permits searches of a car where the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment, or where it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle, id., at 343.  Pp.58.

        
        (b)The Court declines to extend Robinsons categorical rule to searches of data stored on cell phones.  Absent more precise guidance from the founding era, the Court generally determines whether to exempt a given type of search from the warrant requirement by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individuals privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Wyoming v. Houghton,

526 U.S. 295
.  That balance of interests supported the search incident to arrest exception in Robinson.  But a search of digital information on a cell phone does not further the government interests identified in Chimel, and implicates substantially greater individual privacy interests than a brief physical search.  Pp.822.

        
        
        
        (1)The digital data stored on cell phones does not present either Chimel risk.  Pp.1015.

        
        
        
        
        
        (i)Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the arrestees escape.  Officers may examine the phones physical aspects to ensure that it will not be used as a weapon, but the data on the phone can endanger no one.  To the extent that a search of cell phone data might warn officers of an impending danger, e.g., that the arrestees confederates are headed to the scene, such a concern is better addressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances.  See, e.g., Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden,

387 U.S. 294
299.  Pp.1012.

        
        
        
        
        
        (ii)The United States and California raise concerns about the destruction of evidence, arguing that, even if the cell phone is physically secure, information on the cell phone remains vulnerable to remote wiping and data encryption.  As an initial matter, those broad concerns are distinct from Chimels focus on a defendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or destroy evidence within his reach.  The briefing also gives little indication that either problem is prevalent or that the opportunity to perform a search incident to arrest would be an effective solution.  And, at least as to remote wiping, law enforcement currently has some technologies of its own for combatting the loss of evidence.  Finally, law enforcements remaining concerns in a particular case might be addressed by responding in a targeted manner to urgent threats of remote wiping, see Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. ___, ___, or by taking action to disable a phones locking mechanism in order to secure the scene, see Illinois v. McArthur,

531 U.S. 326
333.  Pp.1215.

        
        
        
        (2)A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestees pockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but more substantial privacy interests are at stake when digital data is involved.  Pp.1522.

        
        
        
        
        
        (i)Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestees person.  Notably, modern cell phones have an immense storage capacity.  Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities and generally constituted only a narrow intrusion on privacy.  But cell phones can store millions of pages of text, thousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos.  This has several interrelated privacy consequences.  First, a cell phone collects in one place many distinct types of information that reveal much more in combination than any isolated record.  Second, the phones capacity allows even just one type of information to convey far more than previously possible.  Third, data on the phone can date back for years.  In addition, an element of pervasiveness characterizes cell phones but not physical records.  A decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the more than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives.  Pp.1721.

        
        
        
        
        
        (ii)The scope of the privacy interests at stake is further complicated by the fact that the data viewed on many modern cell phones may in fact be stored on a remote server.  Thus, a search may extend well beyond papers and effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee, a concern that the United States recognizes but cannot definitively foreclose.  Pp.2122.

        
        (c)Fallback options offered by the United States and California are flawed and contravene this Courts general preference to provide clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules.  See Michigan v. Summers,

452 U.S. 692
, n.19.  One possible rule is to import the Gant standard from the vehicle context and allow a warrantless search of an arrestees cell phone whenever it is reasonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of arrest.  That proposal is not appropriate in this context, and would prove no practical limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches.  Another possible rule is to restrict the scope of a cell phone search to information relevant to the crime, the arrestees identity, or officer safety.  That proposal would again impose few meaningful constraints on officers.  Finally, California suggests an analogue rule, under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart.  That proposal would allow law enforcement to search a broad range of items contained on a phone even though people would be unlikely to carry such a variety of information in physical form, and would launch courts on a difficult line-drawing expedition to determine which digital files are comparable to physical records.  Pp.2225.

        
        (d)It is true that this decision will have some impact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime.  But the Courts holding is not that the information on a cell phone is immune from search; it is that a warrant is generally required before a search.  The warrant requirement is an important component of the Courts
 
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and warrants may be obtained with increasing efficiency.  In addition, although the search incident to arrest exception does not apply to cell phones, the continued availability of the exigent circumstances exception may give law enforcement a justification for a warrantless search in particular cases.  Pp.2527.

A search of digital information on a cell phone implicates substantially greater individual privacy interests than a brief physical search; data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate an escape. To the extent that a search of cell phone data might warn officers of an impending danger,, such a concern is better addressed under case-specific exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances. There is little indication that either remote wiping or encryption is prevalent or that the opportunity to perform a search incident to arrest would be an effective solution.

AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS., INC., etal. v. AEREO, INC., fka BAMBOOM LABS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 13461.Argued April 22, 2014Decided June 25, 2014
The Copyright Act of 1976 gives a copyright owner the exclusive righ[t] to perform the copyrighted work publicly.

17 U.S.C. 106(4).  The Acts Transmit Clause defines that exclusive right to include the right to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance ... of the [copyrighted] work ... to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.  101.

        
        
        
        Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air.  When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereos website.  Aereos system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show.  A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet.  A server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on Aereos hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscribers screen once several seconds of programming have been saved.  The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.  

        
        
        
        Petitioners, who are television producers, marketers, distributors, and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs that Aereo streams, sued Aereo for copyright infringement.  They sought a preliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing their right to perform their copyrighted works publicly.  The District Court denied the preliminary injunction, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Aereo performs petitioners works publicly within the meaning of the Transmit Clause.  Pp.418.

        
        (a)Aereo perform[s].  It does not merely supply equipment that allows others to do so.  Pp.410. 

        
        
        
        (1)One of Congress primary purposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to overturn this Courts holdings that the activities of community antenna television (CATV) providers fell outside the Acts scope.  In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,

392 U.S. 390
, the Court determined that a CATV provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster, because its system no more than enhances the viewers capacity to receive the broadcasters signals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewers television set.  Id., at 399.  Therefore, the Court concluded, a CATV provider did not perform publicly.  The Court reached the same determination in respect to a CATV provider that retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,

415 U.S. 394
.  The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer, the Court said.  Id., at 408.  Pp.47.

        
        
        
        (2)In 1976, Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to reject the Fortnightly and Teleprompter holdings.  The Act now clarifies that to perform an audiovisual work means to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.  101.  Thus, both the broadcaster and the viewer perform, because they both show a television programs images and make audible the programs sounds.  Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which specifies that an entity performs when it transmit[s] ... a performance ... to the public.  Ibid.  The Clause makes clear that an entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even when it simply enhances viewers ability to receive broadcast television signals.  Congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public.  111.  Congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activities within the Copyright Acts scope.  Pp.78.

        
        
        
        (3)Because Aereos activities are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach, Aereo is not simply an equipment provider.  Aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are copyrighted, virtually as they are being broadcast.  Aereo uses its own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users homes.  By means of its technology, Aereos system receive[s] programs that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by private channels to additional viewers.  Fortnightly, supra, at 400.

        
        This Court recognizes one particular difference between Aereos system and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter: The systems in those cases transmitted constantly, whereas Aereos system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.  In other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers, a users involvement in the operation of the providers equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the Act.  But given Aereos overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.  Pp.810.

        
        (b)Aereo also performs petitioners works publicly.  Under the Clause, an entity performs a work publicly when it transmit[s] ... a per-formance ... of the work ... to the public.  101.  What performance, if any, does Aereo transmit?  Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of their works, whereas Aereo says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting.  This Court assumes arguendo that Aereo is correct and thus assumes, for present purposes, that to transmit a performance of an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.  Under the Courts assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.

        
        What about the Clauses further requirement that Aereo transmit a performance to the public?  Aereo claims that because it transmits from user-specific copies, using individually-assigned antennas, and because each transmission is available to only one subscriber, it does not transmit a performance to the public.  Viewed in terms of Congress regulatory objectives, these behind-the-scenes technological differences do not distinguish Aereos system from cable systems, which do perform publicly.  Congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as from those of cable companies.

        
        The text of the Clause effectuates Congress intent.  Under the Clause, an entity may transmit a performance through multiple transmissions, where the performance is of the same work.  Thus when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it transmit[s] ... a performance to them, irrespective of the number of discrete communications it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single copy of the work or, as Aereo does, using an individual personal copy for each viewer. 

        
        Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits constitute the public under the Act.  This is because Aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other.  In addition, neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereos subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works.  This is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people, whether they constitute the public often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work.  Finally, the statute makes clear that the fact that Aereos subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations is of no consequence.  Aereo transmits a performance of petitioners works to the public.  Pp.1115.

        
        (c)Given the limited nature of this holding, the Court does not believe its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.  Pp.1517.
712 F.3d 676, reversed and remanded.

UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 121146.Argued February 24, 2014Decided June 23, 2014 [1]
The Clean Air Act imposes permitting requirements on stationary sources, such as factories and powerplants.  The Acts Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to construct or modify a major emitting facility in any area to which [the PSD program] applies without a permit.  7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).  A major emitting facility is a stationary source with the potential to emit 250 tons per year of any air pollutant (or 100 tons per year for certain types of sources).  7479(1).  Facilities seeking to qualify for a PSD permit must, inter alia, comply with emissions limitations that reflect the best available control technology (BACT) for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.  7475(a)(4).  In addition, Title V of the Act makes it unlawful to operate any major source, wherever located, without a permit.  7661a(a).  A major source is a stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any air pollutant.  7661(2)(B), 7602(j).

        
        
        
        In response to Massachusetts v. EPA,

549 U.S. 497
, EPA promulgated greenhouse-gas emission standards for new motor vehicles, and made stationary sources subject to the PSD program and Title V on the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases.  It recognized, however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand those programs and render them unadministrable.  So EPA purported to tailor the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.

        
         
        
        Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPAs actions in the D.C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.
Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
684 F.3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

        
        Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding:

        
        1.The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpretation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions.  Pp.1024.

        
        
        
        (a)The Act does not compel EPAs interpretation.  Massachusetts held that the Act-wide definition of air pollutant includes greenhouse gases, 549 U.S., at 529, but where the term air pollutant appears in the Acts operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.  Massachusetts did not invalidate those longstanding constructions.  The Act-wide definition is not a command to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA may consider regulating under the Acts operative provisions.  Though Congresss profligate use of air pollutant is not conducive to clarity, the presumption of consistent usage readily yields to context, and a statutory term may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.  Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,

549 U.S. 561
.  Pp.1016.

        
        
        
        (b)Nor does the Act permit EPAs interpretation.  Agencies empowered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. ___, ___.  EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be inconsistent with the Acts structure and design.  A review of the relevant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.  EPAs interpretation would also bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPAs regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,

529 U.S. 120
.  Pp.1620.

        
        
        
        (c)EPA lacked authority to tailor the Acts unambiguous numerical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.  Agencies must always give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,

551 U.S. 644
.  The power to execute the laws does not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not to work in practice.  Pp.2024.

        
        2.EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollutants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases.  Pp.2429.

        
        
        
        (a)Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regulation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded.  But an EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider options other than energy efficiency, including carbon capture and storage, which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more traditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies.  Moreover, assuming that BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, important limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about unbounded regulatory authority.  Pp.2427.

        
        
        
        (b)EPAs decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
.  The specific phrasing of the BACT provisionwhich requires BACT for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act, 7475(a)(4)does not suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction.  And even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPAs interpretation unreasonable.  Pp.2729.

        
        Scalia, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, Parts I and II of which were for the Court.  Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J., joined that opinion in full; Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined as to Parts I, IIA, and IIB1; and Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined as to Part IIB2.

It recognized, however, that requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statutory thresholds would radically expand those programs and render them unadministrable.  So EPA purported to tailor the programs to accommodate greenhouse gases by providing, among other things, that sources would not become newly subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year.

        
         
        
        Numerous parties, including several States, challenged EPAs actions in the D.C. Circuit, which dismissed some of the petitions for lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.
Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
684 F.3d 102, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

        
        Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding:

        
        1.The Act neither compels nor permits EPA to adopt an interpretation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions.  Pp.1024.

        
        
        
        (a)The Act does not compel EPAs interpretation.  Massachusetts held that the Act-wide definition of air pollutant includes greenhouse gases, 549 U.S., at 529, but where the term air pollutant appears in the Acts operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.  Massachusetts did not invalidate those longstanding constructions.  The Act-wide definition is not a command to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA may consider regulating under the Acts operative provisions.  Though Congresss profligate use of air pollutant is not conducive to clarity, the presumption of consistent usage readily yields to context, and a statutory term may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.  Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,

549 U.S. 561
.  Pp.1016.

        
        
        
        (b)Nor does the Act permit EPAs interpretation.  Agencies empowered to resolve statutory ambiguities must operate within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. ___, ___.  EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be inconsistent with the Acts structure and design.  A review of the relevant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.  EPAs interpretation would also bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPAs regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,

529 U.S. 120
.  Pp.1620.

        
        
        
        (c)EPA lacked authority to tailor the Acts unambiguous numerical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year to accommodate its greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.  Agencies must always give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,

551 U.S. 644
.  The power to execute the laws does not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not to work in practice.  Pp.2024.

        
        2.EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollutants to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases.  Pp.2429.

        
        
        
        (a)Concerns that BACT, which has traditionally been about end-of-stack controls, is fundamentally unsuited to greenhouse-gas regulation, which is more about energy use, are not unfounded.  But an EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider options other than energy efficiency, including carbon capture and storage, which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more traditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies.  Moreover, assuming that BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, important limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about unbounded regulatory authority.  Pp.2427.

        
        
        
        (b)EPAs decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
.  The specific phrasing of the BACT provisionwhich requires BACT for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act, 7475(a)(4)does not suggest that the provision can bear a narrowing construction.  And even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency authority, as to make EPAs interpretation unreasonable.  Pp.2729.

        
        Scalia, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, Parts I and II of which were for the Court.  Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J., joined that opinion in full; Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined as to Parts I, IIA, and IIB1; and Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined as to Part IIB2.

Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Thomas, J., joined."|"
			The Clean Air Act requires permits for stationary sources, such as factories and powerplants. The Acts Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions make it unlawful to construct or modify a major emitting facility in any area to which [PSD program] applies without a permit, 42 U.S.C. 7475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C). A major emitting facility is a stationary source with the potential to emit 250 tons per year of any air pollutant (or 100 tons per year for certain sources). Facilities seeking a PSD permit must comply with emissions limitations that reflect the best available control technology (BACT) for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act and it is unlawful to operate any major source, wherever located, without a permit. A major source is a stationary source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any air pollutant, under Title V of the Act.  In response to the Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA promulgated greenhouse-gas (GHG) emission standards for new vehicles, and made stationary sources subject to the PSD program and Title V, based on potential GHG emissions. Recognizing that requiring permits for all sources with GHG emissions above statutory thresholds would render the programs unmanageable, EPA purported to tailor the programs to accommodate GHGs by providing that sources would not become newly subject to PSD or Title V permitting on the basis of their potential to emit GHGs in amounts less than 100,000 tons per year. The D.C. Circuit dismissed some challenges to the tailoring rule for lack of jurisdiction and denied the rest.  The Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that the Act does not permit an interpretation requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of potential GHG emissions. The Massachusetts decision held that the Act-wide definition of air pollutant includes GHGs, but with respect to PSD and Title V permitting provisions, EPA has employed a narrower, context-appropriate meaning. Massachusetts did not invalidate the long-standing constructions. The Act-wide definition is not a command to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA may consider regulating.  The presumption of consistent usage yields to context and distinct statutory objects call for different implementation strategies. EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying PSD and Title V permitting requirements to GHGs would be inconsistent with the Acts structure and design, which concern a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.  EPA lacked authority to tailor the Acts unambiguous numerical thresholds to accommodate its GHG-inclusive interpretation. EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that would need permits based on emission of conventional pollutants to comply with BACT for GHGs. BACT, which has traditionally been about end-of-stack controls, may be fundamentally unsuited to GHG regulation, but applying BACT to GHGs is not ""disastrously unworkable,"" and need not result in a dramatic expansion of agency authority.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 13316.Argued April 1, 2014Decided June 23, 2014
A part of the federal bank fraud statute,

18 U.S.C. 1344(2), makes it a crime to knowingly execut[e] a scheme ... to obtain property owned by, or under the custody of, a bank by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.  Petitioner Kevin Loughrin was charged with bank fraud after he was caught forging stolen checks, using them to buy goods at a Target store, and then returning the goods for cash.  The District Court declined to give Loughrins proposed jury instruction that a conviction under 1344(2) required proof of intent to defraud a financial institution.  The jury convicted Loughrin, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Section 1344(2) does not require the Government to prove that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution.  Pp.415.

        
        (a)Section 1344(2) requires only that the defendant intend to obtain bank property and that this end is accomplished by means of a false statement.  No additional requirement of intent to defraud a bank appears in the statutes text.  And imposing that requirement would prevent 1344(2) from applying to cases falling within the statutes clear terms, such as frauds directed against a third-party custodian of bank-owned property.  Loughrins construction would also make 1344(2) a mere subset of 1344(1), which prohibits any scheme to defraud a financial institution.  That view is untenable because those clauses are separated by the disjunctive or, signaling that each is intended to have separate meaning.  And to read clause (1) as fully encompassing clause (2) contravenes two related interpretive canons: that different language signals different meaning, and that no part of a statute should be superfluous.  Pp.46.

        
        (b)Loughrin claims that his view is supported by similar language in the federal mail fraud statute and by federalism principles, but his arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.715.

        
        
        
        (1)In McNally v. United States,

483 U.S. 350
, this Court interpreted similar language in the mail fraud statute, 1341which served as a model for 1344to set forth just one offense, despite the use of the word or.  But the two statutes have notable textual differences.  The mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single, unbroken sentence, whereas 1344s two clauses have separate numbering, line breaks, and equivalent indentationall indications of separate meaning.  Moreover, Congress likely did not intend to adopt McNallys interpretation when it enacted 1344, because at that time (three years before McNally) every Court of Appeals had interpreted the word or in the mail fraud statute in its usual, disjunctive sense.  And while McNally found that unique features of the mail fraud statutes history supported its view, the legislative history surrounding the adoption of 1344 points the other way.  Pp.79.

        
        
        
        (2)Loughrin also contends that without an element of intent to defraud a bank, 1344(2) would apply to every minor fraud in which the victim happens to pay by check.  This, he says, would unduly expand the reach of federal criminal law into an area traditionally left to the States.  But this argument ignores a significant textual limit on 1344(2)s reach: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to acquire) the bank property by means of the misrepresentation.  That language limits 1344(2)s application to cases (like this one) in which the misrepresentation has some real connection to a federally insured bank, and thus to the pertinent federal interest.

HALLIBURTON CO. etal. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING FUND, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 13317.Argued March 5, 2014Decided June 23, 2014
Investors can recover damages in a private securities fraud action only if they prove that they relied on the defendants misrepresentation in deciding to buy or sell a companys stock.  In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,

485 U.S. 224
, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reliance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material informationincluding material misrepresentations.  The Court also held, however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock pricethat is, that it had no price impact.

        
        
        
        Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to inflate Halliburtons stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5.  The District Court initially denied EPJ Funds class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  But this Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causationa causal connection between the defendants alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs economic lossesat the class certification stage in order to invoke Basics presumption of reliance.  On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its alleged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price.  By demonstrating the absence of any price impact, Halliburton contended, it had rebutted the Basic presumption.  And without the benefit of that presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  The District Court rejected Halliburtons argument and certified the class.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evidence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class certification stage.
Held: 

        
        1.Halliburton has not shown a special justification, Dickerson v. United States,

530 U.S. 428
, for overruling Basics presumption of reliance.  Pp.416.

        
        
        
        (a)To recover damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b5, a plaintiff must prove, as relevant here, reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission.  Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  The Court recognized in Basic, however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual plaintiff would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the ... plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market, 485 U.S., at 245, and effectively would prevent plaintiffs from proceeding with a class action in Rule 10b5 suits, id., at 242.  To address these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of a Rule 10b5 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is known as the fraud-on-the-market theory, which holds that the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.  Id., at 246.  The Court also noted that the typical investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.  Id., at 247.  As a result, whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his reliance on any public material misrepresentations ... may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b5 action.  Id. at 247.  Basic also emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.  Pp.57.

        
        
        
        (b)None of Halliburtons arguments for overruling Basic so discredit the decision as to constitute a special justification.  Pp.712.

        
        
        
        
        
        (1)Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is inconsistent with Congresss intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Actthe same argument made by the dissenting Justices in Basic.  The Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive then, and Halliburton has given no new reason to endorse it now.  Pp.78.

        
        
        
        
        
        (2)Halliburton also contends that Basic rested on two premises that have been undermined by developments in economic theory.  First, it argues that the Basic Court espoused a robust view of market efficiency that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence ostensibly showing that material, public information often is not quickly incorporated into stock prices.  The Court in Basic acknowledged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of capital markets and refused to endorse any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.  485 U.S., at 248, n.28.  The Court instead based the presumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.  Id., at 247, n.24.  Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof.  Halliburton has not identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by, economic realities.

        
        Halliburton also contests the premise that investors invest in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price, id., at 247, identifying a number of classes of investors for whom price integrity is supposedly marginal or irrelevant.  But Basic never denied the existence of such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that market prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable period and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted by fraud.  Pp.812.

        
        
        
        (c)The principle of stare decisis has special force in respect to statutory interpretation because Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.  John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,

552 U.S. 130
. So too with Basics presumption of reliance.  The presumption is not inconsistent with this Courts more recent decisions construing the Rule 10b5 cause of action.  In Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,

511 U.S. 164
, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,

552 U.S. 148
, the Court declined to effectively eliminate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation.  The Basic presumption, by contrast, merely provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.  Nor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Courts recent decisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to provenot simply pleadthat their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if applicable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  The Basic presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance.  Finally, Halliburton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securities class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to many of them.  Pp.1216.

        
        2.For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basics presumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly at the class certification stage.  The Basic presumption incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendants misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.  Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendants misrepresentation.  Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly would take away the first constituent presumption.  Halliburtons argument for doing so is the same as its argument for overruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.  Pp.1618.

        
        3.The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact.  Defendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification stage to counter a plaintiffs showing of market efficiency.  Forbidding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are inconsistent with Basics own logic.  Basic allows plaintiffs to establish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an efficient market and that a defendants misrepresentations were public and material.  But an indirect proxy should not preclude consideration of a defendants direct, more salient evidence showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stocks price and, consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply.  Amgen does not require a different result.  There, the Court held that materiality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  In contrast, the fact that a misrepresentation has price impact is Basics fundamental premise.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. ___, ___.  It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage.  That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification.  Given that such indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.  Pp.1823.

Syllabus
HALLIBURTON CO. etal. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING FUND, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 13317.Argued March 5, 2014Decided June 23, 2014
Investors can recover damages in a private securities fraud action only if they prove that they relied on the defendants misrepresentation in deciding to buy or sell a companys stock.  In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,

485 U.S. 224
, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reliance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material informationincluding material misrepresentations.  The Court also held, however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock pricethat is, that it had no price impact.

        
        
        
        Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to inflate Halliburtons stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5.  The District Court initially denied EPJ Funds class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  But this Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causationa causal connection between the defendants alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs economic lossesat the class certification stage in order to invoke Basics presumption of reliance.  On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its alleged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price.  By demonstrating the absence of any price impact, Halliburton contended, it had rebutted the Basic presumption.  And without the benefit of that presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  The District Court rejected Halliburtons argument and certified the class.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evidence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class certification stage.
Held: 

        
        1.Halliburton has not shown a special justification, Dickerson v. United States,

530 U.S. 428
, for overruling Basics presumption of reliance.  Pp.416.

        
        
        
        (a)To recover damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b5, a plaintiff must prove, as relevant here, reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission.  Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  The Court recognized in Basic, however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual plaintiff would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the ... plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market, 485 U.S., at 245, and effectively would prevent plaintiffs from proceeding with a class action in Rule 10b5 suits, id., at 242.  To address these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of a Rule 10b5 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is known as the fraud-on-the-market theory, which holds that the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.  Id., at 246.  The Court also noted that the typical investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.  Id., at 247.  As a result, whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his reliance on any public material misrepresentations ... may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b5 action.  Id. at 247.  Basic also emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.  Pp.57.

        
        
        
        (b)None of Halliburtons arguments for overruling Basic so discredit the decision as to constitute a special justification.  Pp.712.

        
        
        
        
        
        (1)Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is inconsistent with Congresss intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Actthe same argument made by the dissenting Justices in Basic.  The Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive then, and Halliburton has given no new reason to endorse it now.  Pp.78.

        
        
        
        
        
        (2)Halliburton also contends that Basic rested on two premises that have been undermined by developments in economic theory.  First, it argues that the Basic Court espoused a robust view of market efficiency that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence ostensibly showing that material, public information often is not quickly incorporated into stock prices.  The Court in Basic acknowledged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of capital markets and refused to endorse any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.  485 U.S., at 248, n.28.  The Court instead based the presumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.  Id., at 247, n.24.  Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof.  Halliburton has not identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by, economic realities.

        
        Halliburton also contests the premise that investors invest in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price, id., at 247, identifying a number of classes of investors for whom price integrity is supposedly marginal or irrelevant.  But Basic never denied the existence of such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that market prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable period and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted by fraud.  Pp.812.

        
        
        
        (c)The principle of stare decisis has special force in respect to statutory interpretation because Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.  John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,

552 U.S. 130
. So too with Basics presumption of reliance.  The presumption is not inconsistent with this Courts more recent decisions construing the Rule 10b5 cause of action.  In Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,

511 U.S. 164
, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,

552 U.S. 148
, the Court declined to effectively eliminate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation.  The Basic presumption, by contrast, merely provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.  Nor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Courts recent decisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to provenot simply pleadthat their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if applicable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  The Basic presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance.  Finally, Halliburton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securities class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to many of them.  Pp.1216.

        
        2.For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basics presumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly at the class certification stage.  The Basic presumption incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendants misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.  Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendants misrepresentation.  Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly would take away the first constituent presumption.  Halliburtons argument for doing so is the same as its argument for overruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.  Pp.1618.

        
        3.The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact.  Defendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification stage to counter a plaintiffs showing of market efficiency.  Forbidding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are inconsistent with Basics own logic.  Basic allows plaintiffs to establish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an efficient market and that a defendants misrepresentations were public and material.  But an indirect proxy should not preclude consideration of a defendants direct, more salient evidence showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stocks price and, consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply.  Amgen does not require a different result.  There, the Court held that materiality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  In contrast, the fact that a misrepresentation has price impact is Basics fundamental premise.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. ___, ___.  It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage.  That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification.  Given that such indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.  Pp.1823.
718 F.3d 423, vacated and remanded.

        
        Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ.,joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined."|"
			Investors can recover damages in a private securities fraud action only with proof that they relied on misrepresentation in deciding to buy or sell stock. The Supreme Court held, in ""Basic,"" that the requirement could be met by invoking a presumption that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material information, including material misrepresentations; a defendant can rebut the presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock price. EPJ filed a putative class action, alleging misrepresentations designed to inflate Halliburtons stock price, in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b5. The Supreme Court vacated denial of class certification, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove causal connection between the alleged misrepresentations and their economic losses at the class certification stage. On remand, Halliburton argued that certification was nonetheless inappropriate because it had shown that alleged misrepresentations had not affected stock price. Without that presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis, so that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification was inappropriate under FRCP 23(b)(3). The district court certified the class. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, while declining to reject the Basic presumption.

The Court rejected arguments that a robust view of market efficiency is no longer tenable in light of evidence that material, public information often is not quickly incorporated into stock prices and that investors do not invest in reliance on the integrity of market price. Congress could alter Basics presumption, given recent decisions construing Rule 10b5 claims, but has not done so, although it has responded to other concerns. The Basic doctrine includes two presumptions: if a plaintiff shows that the misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, there is a presumption that the misrepresentation affected price. If the plaintiff also shows that he purchased stock at market price during the relevant period, there is a presumption that he purchased in reliance on the misrepresentation. Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly would take away the first presumption. Defendants, however, must have an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance before class certification with evidence of lack of price impact. That a misrepresentation has price impact is Basics fundamental premise and has everything to do with predominance. If reliance is to be shown by that presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before certification. Because indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.

				ALICE CORPORATION PTY. LTD. v. CLS BANK INTERNATIONAL etal.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			

				No. 13298.Argued March 31, 2014Decided June 19, 2014
			

				Petitioner Alice Corporation is the assignee of several patents that disclose a scheme for mitigating settlement risk, i.e., the risk that only one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obligation.  In particular, the patent claims are designed to facilitate the exchange of financial obligations between two parties by using a computer system as a third-party intermediary.  The patents in suit claim (1) a method for exchanging financial obligations, (2) a computer system configured to carry out the method for exchanging obligations, and (3) a computer-readable medium containing program code for performing the method of exchanging obligations.  
			

				
				
				
				
				Respondents (together, CLS Bank), who operate a global network that facilitates currency transactions, filed suit against petitioner, arguing that the patent claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.  Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringement.  After Bilski v. Kappos, 

561 U.S. 593
, was decided, the District Court held that all of the claims were ineligible for patent protection under 

35 U.S.C. 101 because they are directed to an abstract idea.  The en banc Federal Circuit affirmed.  
			

				Held:Because the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, they are not patent eligible under 101.  Pp.517.
			

				
				
				(a)The Court has long held that 101, which defines the subject matter eligible for patent protection, contains an implicit exception for [l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U.S. ___, ___.  In applying the 101 exception, this Court must distinguish patents that claim the buildin[g] block[s] of human ingenuity, which are ineligible for patent protection, from those that integrate the building blocks into something more, see Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. ___, ___, thereby transform[ing] them into a patent-eligible invention, id., at ___.  Pp.56.
			

				
				
				(b)Using this framework, the Court must first determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept.  566 U.S., at ___.  If so, the Court then asks whether the claims elements, considered both individually and as an ordered combination, transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application.  Id., at ___.  Pp.717.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)The claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept: the abstract idea of intermediated settlement.  Under the longstanding rule that [a]n idea of itself is not patentable, Gottschalk v. Benson, 

409 U.S. 63
, this Court has found ineligible patent claims involving an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary form, id., at 7172; a mathematical formula for computing alarm limits in a catalytic conversion process, Parker v. Flook, 

437 U.S. 584
595; and, most recently, a method for hedging against the financial risk of price fluctuations, Bilski, 561 U.S, at 599.   It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea.  On their face, they are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third party to mitigate settlement risk.  Like the risk hedging in Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce, ibid., and the use of a third-party intermediary (or clearing house) is a building block of the modern economy.  Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an abstract idea beyond 101s scope.  Pp.710.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)Turning to the second step of Mayos framework: The method claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.  Pp.1016.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(i)Simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to a method already well known in the art is not enough to supply the inventive concept needed to make this transformation.  Mayo, supra, at ___, ___.  The introduction of a computer into the claims does not alter the analysis.  Neither stating an abstract idea while adding the words apply it, Mayo, supra, at ___, nor limiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment, Bilski, supra, at 610611, is enough for patent eligibility.  Stating an abstract idea while adding the words apply it with a computer simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result.  Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of additional featur[e] that provides any practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself.  Mayo, supra, at ___.  Pp.1114.
			

				
				
				
				
				
				
				(ii)Here, the representative method claim does no more than simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.  Taking the claim elements separately, the function performed by the computer at each stepcreating and maintaining shadow accounts, obtaining data, adjusting account balances, and issuing automated instructionsis [p]urely conventional.   Mayo, 566 U.S., at ___.  Considered as an ordered combination, these computer components ad[d] nothing ... that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.  Id., at ___.  Viewed as a whole, these method claims simply recite the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer.  They do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself or effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field.  An instruction to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer is not enough to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.  Id., at ___.  Pp.1416.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Because petitioners system and media claims add nothing of substance to the underlying abstract idea, they too are patent ineligible under 101.  Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise or fall with its method claims.  And the system claims are no different in substance from the method claims.  The method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to implement the same idea.  This Court has long warn[ed] ... against interpreting 101 in ways that make patent eligibility depend simply on the draftsmans art.  Mayo, supra, at ___.  Holding that the system claims are patent eligible would have exactly that result.  Pp.1617.
			

				717 F. 3d 1269, affirmed.
			

				
				
				Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Sotomayor, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., joined.

			Alice Corporation holds patents that disclose a scheme for mitigating settlement risk, i.e., the risk that only one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obligation.

The patents claim: a method for exchanging financial obligations; a computer system configured to carry out that method; and a computer-readable medium containing program code for performing that method. CLS, a global network that facilitates currency transactions, challenged the claims as not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable. Alice counterclaimed infringement. After the Supreme Courts decision in Bilski, the district court held that the claims were ineligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. 101. The Federal Circuit and a unanimous Supreme Court affirmed.  Section 101, which defines the subject matter eligible for patent protection, contains an implicit exception for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  In applying the exception, patents that claim the building blocks of human ingenuity, which are ineligible for patent protection,  must be distinguished from those that integrate the building blocks into something more, making them patent-eligible. The claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept: the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, which is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce.  The method claims, which simply require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.

UNITED STATES v. CLARKE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 13301.Argued April 23, 2014Decided June 19, 2014
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued summonses to respondents for information and records relevant to the tax obligations of Dynamo Holdings L.P.  See

26 U.S.C. 7602(a).  When respondents failed to comply, the IRS brought an enforcement action in District Court.  Respondents challenged the IRSs motives in issuing the summonses, seeking to question the responsible agents.

			The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued summonses to four individuals, seeking information and records relevant to the tax obligations of Dynamo, 26 U.S.C.7602. When they failed to comply, the IRS brought an enforcement action. The individuals challenged the IRSs motives in issuing the summonses and sought to question the responsible agents. The district court denied the request and ordered the summonses enforced. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that refusal to allow questioning of the agents was an abuse of discretion.

LANE v. FRANKS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 13483.Argued April 28, 2014Decided June 19, 2014
As Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a program for underprivileged youth operated by Central Alabama Community College (CACC), petitioner Edward Lane conducted an audit of the programs expenses and discovered that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State Representative on CITYs payroll, had not been reporting for work.  Lane eventually terminated Schmitz employment.  Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz.  Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.  Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant budget shortfalls.  Respondent Franks, then CACCs president, terminated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties.  A few days later, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminationsthose of Lane and one other employee.  Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under

42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that Franks had violated the
 
First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz.

        
        
        
        The District Court granted Franks motion for summary judgment, holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the
 
Eleventh Amendment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that Lanes testimony was not entitled to
 
First Amendment protection.  It reasoned that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated and terminated Schmitz employment.
Held:

        
        1.Lanes sworn testimony outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is entitled to
 
First Amendment protection.  Pp.613.

        
        
        
        (a)Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,

391 U.S. 563
, requires balancing the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.  Under the first step of the Pickering analysis, if the speech is made pursuant to the employees ordinary job duties, then the employee is not speaking as a citizen for
 
First Amendment purposes, and the inquiry ends.  Garcetti v. Ceballos,

547 U.S. 410
.  But if the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern, the inquiry turns to whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.  Id., at 418.  Pp.68.

        
        
        
        (b)Lanes testimony is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  Pp.812.

        
        
        
        
        
        (1)Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth.  That obligation is distinct and independent from any separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his employer.  The Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly in holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply because he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course of his employment.  Garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of that employment.  The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employees duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.  Indeed, speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.  Pp.911.

        
        
        
        
        
        (2)Whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the content, form, and context of the speech.  Connick v. Myers,

461 U.S. 138
148.  Here, corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern.  See Garcetti, 547 U.S., at 425.  And the form and context of the speechsworn testimony in a judicial proceedingfortify that conclusion.  See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.1112.

        
        
        
        (c)Turning to Pickerings second step, the employers side of the scale is entirely empty.  Respondents do not assert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their favorfor instance, evidence that Lanes testimony was false or erro-neous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed sensitive, confidential, or privileged information while testifying.  Pp.1213.

        
        2.Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him in his individual capacity.  The question here is whether Franks reasonably could have believed that, when he fired Lane, a government employer could fire an employee because of testimony the employee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities.  See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  At the relevant time, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks from holding that belief, and no decision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on controlling Circuit precedent.  Any discrepancies in Eleventh Circuit precedent only serve to highlight the dispositive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time Franks acted.  Pp.1317.

        
        3.The Eleventh Circuit declined to consider the District Courts dismissal of the claims against respondent Burrow in her official capacity as CACCs acting president, and the parties have not asked this Court to consider them here.  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to those claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  P.17.
523 Fed. Appx. 709, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

        
        Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined.

Corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds involve matters of significant public concern; the form and context of the speech, sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding, fortify that conclusion. There is no government interest that favors Franks: there was no evidence that Lanes testimony was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed confidential information.

ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 121493.Argued January 22, 2014Decided June 16, 2014
Petitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.  The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form 4473) asked whether he was the actual transferee/buyer of the gun, and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer.  Abramski falsely answered that he was the actual buyer.  Abramski was convicted for knowingly making false statements with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness ofthe sale of a gun,

18 U.S.C. 922(a)(6), and for making a false statement with respect to the information required ... to be kept in the gun dealers records, 924(a)(1)(A).  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 

        
        1.Abramskis misrepresentation is material under 922(a)(6).  Pp.722.

        
        
        
        (a)Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely unconcerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute.  To be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealers transactions with persons or transferees without specifying whether that language refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser.  But when read in light of the statutes context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw.  Federal gun law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of felons and other prohibited purchasers.  922(c), 922(t).  It also imposes record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to their buyers.  922(b)(5), 923(g).  These provisions would mean little if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf.  The statutes language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual rather than nominal buyer.  This conclusion is reinforced by this Courts standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.  Pp.719.

        
        
        
        (b)Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for himself.  But Abramskis false statement prevented the dealer from insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a background check.  922(b), (c), (t).  Nothing in the statute suggests that these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buyer turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun.  Because the dealer could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale.  Pp.1922.

        
        2.Abramskis misrepresentation about the identity of the actual buyer concerned information required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of the United States Code] to be kept in the dealers records.  924(a)(1)(A).  Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to maintain such records ... as the Attorney General may ... prescribe.  923(g)(1)(A).  The Attorney General requires every licensed dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27 CFR 478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the actual buyer question that Abramski answered falsely.  Therefore, falsely answering a question on Form 4473 violates 924(a)(1)(A).  Pp.2223.
706 F.3d 307, affirmed.

        
        Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined.

			Abramski offered to purchase a gun for his uncle. Form 4473 asked whether he was the actual transferee/buyer of the gun and warned that a straw purchaser (buying a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was convicted for knowingly making false statements with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of a gun, 18 U.S.C. 922(a)(6), and for making a false statement with respect to the information required ... to be kept in the gun dealers records, section 924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the misrepresentation was material and rejecting Abramskis argument that federal gun laws are unconcerned with straw arrangements.  While the law regulates licensed dealers transactions with persons or transferees without specifying whether that language refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser, read in light of the statutes context, structure, and purpose, the language clearly refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. The law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of felons and other prohibited purchasers and imposes record-keeping requirements to assist authorities in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns tor buyers. The provisions would mean little if they could be avoided simply by enlisting the aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork. The statutes language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual rather than nominal buyer.  While Abramskis uncle could, possibly, have legally bought a gun for himself, Abramskis false statement prevented the dealer from insisting that the true buyer appear in person, provide identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a background check. The dealer could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was not the true buyer, so the misstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale.

Syllabus
REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. NML CAPITAL, LTD.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 12842.Argued April 21, 2014Decided June 16, 2014
After petitioner, Republic of Argentina, defaulted on its external debt, respondent, NML Capital, Ltd. (NML), one of Argentinas bondholders, prevailed in 11 debt-collection actions that it brought against Argentina in the Southern District of New York.  In aid of executing the judgments, NML sought discovery of Argentinas property, serving subpoenas on two nonparty banks for records relating to Argentinas global financial transactions.  The District Court granted NMLs motions to compel compliance.  The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting Argentinas argument that the District Courts order transgressed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act).
Held:No provision in the FSIA immunizes a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor from postjudgment discovery of information concerning its extraterritorial assets.  Pp.412.

        
        (a)This Court assumes without deciding that, in the ordinary case, a district court would have the discretion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a)(2) to permit discovery of third-party information bearing on a judgment debtors extraterritorial assets.  Pp.45.

        
        (b)The FSIA replaced an executive-driven, factor-intensive, loosely common-law-based immunity regime with a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity.  Republic of Austria v. Altmann,

541 U.S. 677
.  Henceforth, any sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court must stand or fall on the Acts text.  The Act confers on foreign states two kinds of immunity.  The first, jurisdictional immunity (

28 U.S.C. 1604), was waived here.  The second, execution immunity, generally shields property in the United States of a foreign state from attachment, arrest, and execution.  1609, 1610.  See also 1611(a), (b)(1), (b)(2).  The Act has no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery in aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debtors assets.

        Argentinas arguments are unavailing.  Even if Argentina were correct that 1609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery-in-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield from discovery a foreign sovereigns extraterritorial assets, since the text of 1609 immunizes only foreign-state property in the United States.  The prospect that NMLs general request for information about Argentinas worldwide assets may turn up information about property that Argentina regards as immune does not mean that NML cannot pursue discovery of it.

SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST etal. v. DRIEHAUS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 13193.Argued April 22, 2014Decided June 16, 2014
Respondent Driehaus, a former Congressman, filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission alleging that petitioner Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false statements made during the course of a political campaign.  Specifically, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a vote in favor of taxpayer funded abortion.  After Driehaus lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA continued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging the law on
 
First Amendment grounds.  Petitioner Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a
 
First Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained due to the proceedings against SBA.  The District Court consolidated the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.
Held:Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article III purposes.  Pp.718.

        
        (a)To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show, inter alia, an injury in fact, which must be concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,

504 U.S. 555
.  When challenging a law prior to its enforcement, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.  Babbitt v. Farm Workers,

442 U.S. 289
.  Pp.711.

        
        (b)Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement of the Ohio law.  Pp.1117.

        
        
        
        (1)Petitioners have alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest by pleading specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.  Pp.1112.

        
        
        
        (2)Petitioners intended future conduct is also arguably ... proscribed by [the] statute.  The Ohio false statement statute sweeps broadly, and a panel of the Ohio Elections Commission already found probable cause to believe that SBA violated the law when it made statements similar to those petitioners plan to make in the future.  Golden v. Zwickler,

394 U.S. 103
, is distinguishable; the threat of prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly conjectural because the plaintiffs sole concern related to a former Congressman who was unlikely to run for office again.  Here, by contrast, petitioners speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate.  Nor does SBAs insistence that its previous statements were true render its fears of enforcement misplaced.  After all, that insistence did not prevent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the first time.  Pp.1213.

        
        
        
        (3)Finally, the threat of future enforcement is substantial.  There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners.  Past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not chimerical.  Steffel v. Thompson,

415 U.S. 452
.  The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a complaint may be filed with the State Commission by any person, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 3517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.  

        
        The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern because of the burden they impose on electoral speech.  Moreover, the target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days before an election.  But this Court need not decide whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is sufficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution.  Pp.1417.

        
        (c)The Sixth Circuit separately considered two other prudential factors: fitness and hardship.  This Court need not resolve the continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case because those factors are easily satisfied here.  See Lexmark Intl, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. ___.  Pp.1718.
525 Fed. Appx. 415, reversed and remanded.

        
        Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 12761.Argued April 21, 2014Decided June 12, 2014
This case involves the intersection of two federal statutes.  The Lanham Act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.

15 U.S.C. 1125.  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.  21 U.S.C. 321(f), 331.  To implement the FDCAs provisions, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling, including one concerning juice blends.  Unlike the Lanham Act, which, relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations give the United States nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suits.  The FDCA also pre-empts certain state misbranding laws.  

        
        
        
        Petitioner POM Wonderful LLC, which produces, markets, and sells, inter alia, a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham Act suit against respondent Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of Coca-Colas juice blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the ensuing confusion causes POM to lose sales.  The District Court granted partial summary judgment to Coca-Cola, ruling that the FDCA and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the name and label of Coca-Colas juice blend.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  
Held:Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POMs challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA.  Pp.717.

        
        (a)This result is based on the following premises.  First, this is not a pre-emption case, for it does not raise the question whether state law is pre-empted by a federal law, see Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555
, but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute.  Pre-emption principles may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on the same subject.  Second, this is a statutory interpretation case; and analysis of the statutory text, aided by established interpretation rules, controls.  See Chickasaw Nation v. United States,

534 U.S. 84
.  While a principle of interpretation may be countered by some maxim pointing in a different direction, Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,

532 U.S. 105
, this Court need not decide what maxim establishes the proper framework here: Even assuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Courts task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied repeal in part of another statute, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best way to do that is to bar POMs Lanham Act claim.  Pp.79.

        
        (b)Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA.  The absence of such a textual provision when the Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted for over 70 years is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.  See Wyeth, supra, at 575.  In addition, and contrary to Coca-Colas argument, Congress, by taking care to pre-empt only some state laws, if anything indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude requirements arising from other sources.  See Setser v. United States, 566 U.S. ___, ___.  The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act reinforce this conclusion.  Where two statutes are complementary, it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Congress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other.  See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Intl, Inc.,

534 U.S. 124
.  The Lanham Act and the FDCA complement each other in major respects, for each has its own scope and purpose.  Both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while the FDCA protects public health and safety.  They also complement each other with respect to remedies.  The FDCAs enforcement is largely committed to the FDA, while the Lanham Act empowers private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-case basis.  Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation.  A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels also could lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend.  Be-cause the FDA does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels, preclusion of Lanham Act claims could leave commercial interestsand indirectly the public at largewith less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industries.  Pp.912.

        
        (c)Coca-Colas arguments do not support its claim that preclusion is proper because Congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling.  First, the FDCAs delegation of enforcement authority to the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.  Second, the FDCAs express pre-emption provision applies by its terms to state, not federal, law.  Even if it were proper to stray from that text, it not clear that Coca-Colas national uniformity assertions reflect the congressional design.  Finally, the FDCA and its implementing regulations may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the Lanham Act, but this specificity would matter only if the two Acts cannot be implemented in full at the same time.  Here, neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms.  Pp.1315.

        
        (d)The Governments intermediate positionthat a Lanham Act claim is precluded to the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label, and that this rule precludes POMs challenge to the name of Coca-Colas productis flawed, for the Government assumes that the FDCA and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when Congress intended the Lanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with respect to labeling.  Though the FDAs rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests, it neither discusses nor cites the Lanham Act; and the Government points to no other statement suggesting that the FDA considered the full scope of interests protected by the Lanham Act.  Even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agencys after-the-fact statement to justify that result here.  An agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.  Pp.1517.

POM WONDERFUL LLC v. COCA-COLA CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 12761.Argued April 21, 2014Decided June 12, 2014
This case involves the intersection of two federal statutes.  The Lanham Act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.

15 U.S.C. 1125.  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.  21 U.S.C. 321(f), 331.  To implement the FDCAs provisions, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling, including one concerning juice blends.  Unlike the Lanham Act, which, relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations give the United States nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suits.  The FDCA also pre-empts certain state misbranding laws.  

        
        
        
        Petitioner POM Wonderful LLC, which produces, markets, and sells, inter alia, a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham Act suit against respondent Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of Coca-Colas juice blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the ensuing confusion causes POM to lose sales.  The District Court granted partial summary judgment to Coca-Cola, ruling that the FDCA and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the name and label of Coca-Colas juice blend.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  
Held:Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POMs challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA.  Pp.717.

        
        (a)This result is based on the following premises.  First, this is not a pre-emption case, for it does not raise the question whether state law is pre-empted by a federal law, see Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555
, but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute.  Pre-emption principles may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on the same subject.  Second, this is a statutory interpretation case; and analysis of the statutory text, aided by established interpretation rules, controls.  See Chickasaw Nation v. United States,

534 U.S. 84
.  While a principle of interpretation may be countered by some maxim pointing in a different direction, Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,

532 U.S. 105
, this Court need not decide what maxim establishes the proper framework here: Even assuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Courts task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied repeal in part of another statute, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best way to do that is to bar POMs Lanham Act claim.  Pp.79.

        
        (b)Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA.  The absence of such a textual provision when the Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted for over 70 years is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.  See Wyeth, supra, at 575.  In addition, and contrary to Coca-Colas argument, Congress, by taking care to pre-empt only some state laws, if anything indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude requirements arising from other sources.  See Setser v. United States, 566 U.S. ___, ___.  The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act reinforce this conclusion.  Where two statutes are complementary, it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Congress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other.  See J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Intl, Inc.,

534 U.S. 124
.  The Lanham Act and the FDCA complement each other in major respects, for each has its own scope and purpose.  Both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while the FDCA protects public health and safety.  They also complement each other with respect to remedies.  The FDCAs enforcement is largely committed to the FDA, while the Lanham Act empowers private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-case basis.  Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation.  A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels also could lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend.  Be-cause the FDA does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels, preclusion of Lanham Act claims could leave commercial interestsand indirectly the public at largewith less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industries.  Pp.912.

        
        (c)Coca-Colas arguments do not support its claim that preclusion is proper because Congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling.  First, the FDCAs delegation of enforcement authority to the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.  Second, the FDCAs express pre-emption provision applies by its terms to state, not federal, law.  Even if it were proper to stray from that text, it not clear that Coca-Colas national uniformity assertions reflect the congressional design.  Finally, the FDCA and its implementing regulations may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the Lanham Act, but this specificity would matter only if the two Acts cannot be implemented in full at the same time.  Here, neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms.  Pp.1315.

        
        (d)The Governments intermediate positionthat a Lanham Act claim is precluded to the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label, and that this rule precludes POMs challenge to the name of Coca-Colas productis flawed, for the Government assumes that the FDCA and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when Congress intended the Lanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with respect to labeling.  Though the FDAs rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests, it neither discusses nor cites the Lanham Act; and the Government points to no other statement suggesting that the FDA considered the full scope of interests protected by the Lanham Act.  Even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agencys after-the-fact statement to justify that result here.  An agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.  Pp.1517.

			POM, which produces and sells a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham Act suit (15 U.S.C. 1125) against Coca-Cola, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of a Coca-Cola juice blend mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it actually consists of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the confusion causes POM to lose sales.

The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that competitors may bring Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA. The Court noted that the issue was preclusion, not pre-emption. Even if the Courts task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one is an implied repeal in part of another, the best way to do that does not require barring POMs Lanham Act claim.  Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA expressly forbids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA. The laws complement each other in major respects: both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while the FDCA protects public health and safety.

CLARK et ux. v. RAMEKER, TRUSTEE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 13299.Argued March 24, 2014Decided June 12, 2014
When petitioners filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, they sought to exclude roughly $300,000 in an inherited individual retirement account (IRA) from the bankruptcy estate using the retirement funds exemption.  See

11 U.S.C. 522(b)(3)(C).  The Bankruptcy Court concluded that an inherited IRA does not share the same characteristics as a traditional IRA and disallowed the exemption.  The District Court reversed, explaining that the exemption covers any account in which the funds were originally accumulated for retirement purposes.  The Seventh Circuit disagreed and reversed the District Court.
Held:Funds held in inherited IRAs are not retirement funds within the meaning of 522(b)(3)(C).  Pp.411.

        
        (a)The ordinary meaning of retirement funds is properly understood to be sums of money set aside for the day an individual stops working.  Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs provide objective evidence that they do not contain such funds.  First, the holder of an inherited IRA may never invest additional money in the account.

26 U.S.C. 219(d)(4).  Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required to withdraw money from the accounts, no matter how far they are from retirement.  408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B).  Finally, the holder of an inherited IRA may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any timeand use it for any purposewithout penalty.  Pp.46.

        
        (b)This reading is consistent with the purpose of the Bankruptcy Codes exemption provisions, which effectuate a careful balance between the creditors interest in recovering assets and the debtors interest in protecting essential needs.  Allowing debtors to protect funds in traditional and Roth IRAs ensures that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs during their retirement years.  By contrast, nothing about an inherited IRAs legal characteristics prevent or discourage an individual from using the entire balance immediately after bankruptcy for purposes of current consumption.  The retirement funds exemption should not be read in a manner that would convert the bankruptcy objective of protecting debtors basic needs into a free pass, Schwab v. Reilly,

560 U.S. 770
.  Pp.67.

        
        (c)Petitioners counterarguments do not overcome the statutes text and purpose.  Their claim that funds in an inherited IRA are retirement funds because, at some point, they were set aside for retirement, conflicts with ordinary usage and would render the term retirement funds, as used in 522(b)(3)(C), superfluous.  Congress could have achieved the exact same result without specifying the funds as retirement funds.  And the absence of the phrase debtors interest, which appears in many other 522 exemptions, does not indicate that 522(b)(3)(C) covers funds intended for someone elses retirement.  Where used, that phrase works to limit the value of the asset that the debtor may exempt from her estate, not to distinguish between a debtors assets and the assets of another.  Also unpersuasive is petitioners argument that 522(b)(3)(C)s sentence structurei.e., a broad category, here, retirement funds, followed by limiting language, here, to the extent thatprevents the broad category from performing any independent limiting work.  This is not the only way in which the phrase to the extent that may be read, and this argument reintroduces the problem that makes the term retirement funds superfluous.  Finally, the possibility that an account holder can leave an inherited IRA intact until retirement and take only the required minimum distributions does not mean that an inherited IRA bears the legal characteristics of retirement funds.

714 F.3d 559, affirmed.

EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INSURANCE AGENCY v. ARKISON, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE OF ESTATE OF BELLINGHAM INSURANCE AGENCY, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 121200.Argued January 14, 2014Decided June 9, 2014
Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA), filed a voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  Respondent Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy trustee, filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against petitioner Executive Benefits Insurance Agency (EBIA) and others alleging the fraudulent conveyance of assets from BIA to EBIA.  The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for the trustee.  EBIA appealed to the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Courts decision after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee.  While EBIAs appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, this Court held that Article III did not permit a Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious interference, even though final adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized by statute.  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  In light of Stern, EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The Ninth Circuit rejected EBIAs motion and affirmed.  It acknowledged the trustees claims as Stern claims, i.e., claims designated for final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.  The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that EBIA had impliedly consented to jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals also observed that the Bankruptcy Courts judgment could instead be treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to de novo review by the District Court.
Held: 

        
        1.Under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory categories of proceedings: core proceedings and non-core proceedings.  See generally

28 U.S.C. 157.  In core proceedings, a bankruptcy judge may hear and determine ... and enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to the district courts traditional appellate review.  157(b)(1).  In non-core proceedingsthose that are not ... core but are otherwise related to a case under title 11, 157(c)(1)final judgment must be entered by the district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judges proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, ibid., except that the bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent, 157(c)(2).  

        
        In Stern, the Court confronted an underlying conflict between the 1984 Act and the requirements of Article III.  The Court held that Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to finally adjudicate the core claim of tortious interference.  The Court did not, however, address how courts should proceed when they encounter a Stern claim.  Pp.48.

        
        2.Stern claims may proceed as non-core within the meaning of 157(c).  Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a statutory gap, since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.  However, this so-called gap is closed by the Acts severability provision, which instructs that where a provision of the Act or [its] application ... is held invalid, the remainder of th[e] Act ... is not affected thereby.

98Stat.
344.  As applicable here, when a court identifies a Stern claim, it has held invalid the application of 157(b), and the remainder not affected includes 157(c), which governs non-core proceedings.  Accordingly, where a claim otherwise satisfies 157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the Stern claim as non-core.  This conclusion accords with the Courts general approach to severability, which is to give effect to the valid portion of a statute so long as it remains fully operative as a law, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,

561 U.S. 477
, and so long as the statutory text and context do not suggest that Congress would have preferred no statute at all, ibid.  Pp.810.

        
        3.Section 157(c)(1)s procedures apply to the fraudulent conveyance claims here.  This Court assumes without deciding that these claims are Stern claims, which Article III does not permit to be treated as core claims under 157(b).  But because the claims assert that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed, they are self-evidently related to a case under title 11.  Accordingly, they fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by 157(c)(1). The Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow that provisions procedures, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the District Court for de novo review.  Pp.1112.

        
        4.Here, the District Courts de novo review of the Bankruptcy Courts order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any potential error in the Bankruptcy Courts entry of judgment.  EBIA contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an Article III court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy court adjudication.  In the alternative, EBIA asserts that even if such consent were constitutionally permissible, it did not in fact consent.  Neither contention need be addressed here, because EBIA received the same review from the District Court that it would have received had the Bankruptcy Court treated the claims as non-core proceedings under 157(c)(1).  Pp.1213.
702 F.3d 553, affirmed.

Under 28 U.S.C. 157, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges core proceedings and non-core proceedings.  In core proceedings, a bankruptcy judge may hear and determine . . . and enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to the district courts traditional appellate review. In non-core proceedingsthose that are otherwise related to a case under title 11, final judgment must be entered by the district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judges proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent. Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a statutory gap, since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding. However, the gap is closed by the Acts severability provision; when a court identifies a Stern claim, the bankruptcy court should simply treat that claim as non-core. The fraudulent conveyance claims, which Article III does not permit to be treated as core claims are related to a case under title 11 and  fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by section 157(c)(1).

SCIALABBA, ACTING DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, etal. v. CUELLAR de OSORIO etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 12930.Argued December 10, 2013Decided June 9, 2014
The Immigration and Nationality Act permits qualifying U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to petition for certain family members to obtain immigrant visas.  A sponsored individual, known as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a family preference category based on his relationship with the petitioner.  8 U.S.C. 1153(a)(1)(4).  The principal beneficiarys spouse and minor children in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, entitled to the same status and order of consideration as the principal.  1153(d).  The beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of priority datethat is, the date a petition was filed.  1153(e)(1).  Because the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a child seeking to immigrate may age outi.e., reach adulthood and lose her immigration statusbefore she reaches the front of the visa queue.  The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy in that circumstance, providing that [i]f the age of an alien is determined ... to be 21 years of age or older, notwithstanding certain allowances for bureaucratic delay, 1153(h)(1)(2), the aliens petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.  1153(h)(3).

        
        
        
        Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed petitions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed petitions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.  Instead, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave the new petitions current priority dates.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIAs) determination that only those petitions that can be seamlessly converted from one family preference category to another without the need for a new sponsor are entitled to conversion under 1153(h)(3).  The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the provision unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
695 F.3d 1003, reversed and remanded.

        
        Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg, concluded that the BIAs textually reasonable construction of 1153(h)(3)s ambiguous language was entitled to deference.  Pp.1333.

        
        (a)Because 1153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue here, a court must defer to the BIAs reasonable interpretation.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
.  The first clause of 1153(h)(3) states a condition that encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition.  The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the first.  It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the beneficiaries described in the first clause.  This remedial prescription directs immigration officials to take the aliens petition and convert it from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or any new filing.  Moreover, this conversion is to be automati[c]that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.  Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from 1153(h)(3)s back half are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.

        
        The understanding that automatic conversion entails nothing more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive way immigration law used the term when 1153(h)(3) was enacted.  See 8 CFR 204.2(i)(1)(3) (2002).  And Congress used the word conversion in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA.  See, e.g., 1151(f)(2), (3). 

        
        If the term meant more than that in 1153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference systems core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified and willing sponsor.  See 1154(a), (b).  If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor, e.g., the old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify for a new family preference category.  But immigration officials cannot assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on the aliens behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes on family preference petitioners.  See, e.g., 1154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II).  Nei-ther can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves a new petitionthe very thing 1153(h)(3) says is not required.  

        
        In any case, a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requisite time.  An alien is deemed to age out on the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the aliens parent.  1153(h)(1)(A).  Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the date of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same.  But at that time, the aged-out beneficiarys parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR, and so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old ones shoes.

        
        On the above account, 1153(h)(3)s second clause provides a remedy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out.  In contrast, aliens like respondents childrenthe nieces, nephews, and grandchildren of the initial sponsorscannot qualify for automatic conversion:  they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with the initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category without obtaining a new sponsor.

        
        The ambiguity created by 1153(h)(3)s ill-fitting clauses left the BIA to choose how to reconcile the statutes different commands.  It reasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of 1153(h)(3)s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of the first clauses condition.  When an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require this Court to defer.  See National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,

551 U.S. 644
.  Pp.1322.

        
        (b)Respondents take issue with the BIAs interpretation, but none of their contentions is persuasive.  Pp.2233.

        
        
        
        (1)Respondents aver that every aged-out beneficiary could be automatically converted if immigration officials substituted new sponsors and managed the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor existed on the relevant date.  These administrative maneuvers are not in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of automatic conversion, they require conversion to occur on a date that has no connection to the aliens aging out, and they demand administrative juggling to make automatic conversion work.  And that painstakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivatives parent may never become able to sponsor a visaand immigration officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.  Pp.2227.

        
        
        
        (2)Respondents argue that the word and in the second clause of 1153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion.  But and does not necessarily disjoin two phrases, and context suggests that the instructions work in tandem.  In other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting conversions, retention of a priority date is conditional on a conversion occurring.  See, e.g., 1154(k)(1)(3).  Respondents reading would make priority date retention conditional on something the statute nowhere mentions.  And it would engender unusual results that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that Congress intended.  Pp. 2730.

        
        
        
        (3)Finally, respondents contend that, assuming 1153(h)(3) is ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restrictive reading.  But the BIAs interpretation benefits from administrative simplicity and fits with immigration laws basic first-come, first-served rule.  By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative beneficiaries, like respondents sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for a far longer time.  Pp. 3133.

        
        The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, agreed that the BIAs interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute.  There is no conflict or internal tension in 1153(h)(3).  The first clause of the provision defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant anything to anyone.  The particular benefit provided by the statuteautomatic conversion and retention of priority dateis found exclusively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum, that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary.  Beyond that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be automatically converted.  The BIAs reasonable interpretation of 1153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigration system.  Pp.14.

			Qualifying U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) may petition for family members to obtain immigrant visas. A sponsored individual (principal beneficiary) is placed into a family preference category based on relationship to the petitioner, 8 U.S.C. 1153(a)(1)(4). The principal beneficiarys spouse and minor children qualify as derivative beneficiaries, entitled to the same status and order of consideration as the principal. Beneficiaries become eligible to apply for visas in order of priority date, the date a petition was filed. Because the process often takes years, a child may age out and lose status before she obtains a visa. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) provides that if the age of an alien is determined to be 21 years or older, notwithstanding allowances for bureaucratic delay, the petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.  In this case, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed petitions for their aged-out children (who did not have a qualifying relationship with the original sponsor), asserting that the newly filed petitions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.  U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) disagreed. The district court granted the government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIAs) determination under section 1153(h)(3). The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the provision entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention. The Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that each immigrant must have a qualified and willing sponsor. If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out children, another sponsor must be identified for the alien to qualify for a new family preference category. Immigration officials do not know whether a valid sponsor exists unless the aged-out beneficiary files and USCIS approves a new petition. Section 1153(h)(3) does not require a new petition for derivative beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out. In contrast, the nieces, nephews, and grandchildren of the initial sponsors cannot qualify for automatic conversion.  The BIAs interpretation benefits from administrative simplicity and fits with immigration laws basic first-come, first-served rule.

CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 13339.Argued April 23, 2014Decided June 9, 2014
Federal law pre-empts state-law statutes of limitations in certain tort actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment.

42 U.S.C. 9658.  Petitioner CTS Corporation sold property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an electronics plant.  Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging damages from the stored contaminants.  CTS moved to dismiss, citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendants last culpable act.  Because CTSs last act occurred when it sold the property, the District Court granted the motion.  Finding 9658 ambiguous, the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statutes remedial purpose favored pre-emption.
Held:The judgment is reversed.  
723 F.3d 434, reversed.

        
        Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IID, concluding that 9658 does not pre-empt state statutes of repose.  Pp.516.

        
        (a)The outcome here turns on whether 9658 distinguishes between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability.  There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two, but their specified time periods are measured differently and they seek to attain different purposes and objectives.  Statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues.  Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendants last culpable act or omission.  The application of equitable tolling underscores their difference in purpose.  Because a statute of limitations purpose is not furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute.  The purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and equitable tolling does not apply.  Pp.58.

        
        (b)The text and structure of 9658 resolve this case.  Under that provision, pre-emption is characterized as an [e]xception, 9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the the statute of limitations established under State law applies.  The applicable limitations period, the commencement date of which is subject to pre-emption, is defined as the period specified in a statute of limitations.  9658(b)(2).  That term appears four times, and statute of repose does not appear at all.  While it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided 9658s enactment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both types of statutes.  Because that distinction is not similarly reflected in 9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-empt statutes of repose. 

        
        Other textual features further support this conclusion.  It would be awkward to use the singular applicable limitations period to mandate pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes.  And the definition of that limitations period as the period during which a civil action under state law may be brought, 9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists.  A statute of repose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into existence.  Section 9658s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that the statutes reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling.  Respondents contend that 9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose create an obstacle to Congress purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555
564.  But the level of generality at which the statutes purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose.  Here, where Congress chose to leave many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of statutory purposes.  Pp.816.

        
        Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IID.  Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined as to all but Part IID.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined.

        (a)The outcome here turns on whether 9658 distinguishes between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability.  There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two, but their specified time periods are measured differently and they seek to attain different purposes and objectives.  Statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues.  Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendants last culpable act or omission.  The application of equitable tolling underscores their difference in purpose.  Because a statute of limitations purpose is not furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute.  The purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and equitable tolling does not apply.  Pp.58.

        
        (b)The text and structure of 9658 resolve this case.  Under that provision, pre-emption is characterized as an [e]xception, 9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the the statute of limitations established under State law applies.  The applicable limitations period, the commencement date of which is subject to pre-emption, is defined as the period specified in a statute of limitations.  9658(b)(2).  That term appears four times, and statute of repose does not appear at all.  While it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided 9658s enactment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both types of statutes.  Because that distinction is not similarly reflected in 9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-empt statutes of repose. 

        
        Other textual features further support this conclusion.  It would be awkward to use the singular applicable limitations period to mandate pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes.  And the definition of that limitations period as the period during which a civil action under state law may be brought, 9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists.  A statute of repose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into existence.  Section 9658s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that the statutes reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling.  Respondents contend that 9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose create an obstacle to Congress purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555
564.  But the level of generality at which the statutes purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose.  Here, where Congress chose to leave many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of statutory purposes.  Pp.816.

        
        Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IID.  Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined as to all but Part IID.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer, J., joined."|"
			The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 960, contains a provision (section 9658) that preempts statutes of limitations applicable to state-law actions for personal injury or property damage arising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment. Section 9658 adopts the discovery rule, so that statutes of limitations begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, that the harm was caused by the contaminant because person who is exposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show signs of resulting injury for many years. CTS sold property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an electronics plant; 24 years later, owners of parts of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendants last culpable act. Because CTSs last act occurred when it sold the property, the district court granted the motion. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statutes remedial purpose favored preemption.  The Supreme Court reversed in part, concluding that section 9658 does not pre-empt state statutes of repose. Statutes of limitations promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendants last culpable actor omission. Under the language of the statute, pre-emption is characterized as an exception to the regular rule that the the statute of limitations established under State law applies; it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to preempt statutes of repose.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
BOND v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 12158.Argued November 5, 2013Decided June 2, 2014
To implement the international Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, Congress enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998.  The statute forbids, among other things, any person knowingly to possess[] or use ... any chemical weapon,

18 U.S.C. 229(a)(1).  A chemical weapon is [a] toxic chemical and its precursors, except where intended for a purpose not prohibited under this chapter.  229F(1)(A).  A toxic chemical is any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals.  The term includes all such chemicals, regardless of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.  229F(8)(A).  [P]urposes not prohibited by this chapter is defined as [a]ny peaceful purpose related to an industrial, agricultural, research, medical, or pharmaceutical activity or other activity, and other specific purposes.  229F(7).

        
        
        
        Petitioner Bond sought revenge against Myrlinda Hayneswith whom her husband had carried on an affairby spreading two toxic chemicals on Hayness car, mailbox, and door knob in hopes that Haynes would develop an uncomfortable rash.  On one occasion Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn that she treated by rinsing with water, but Bonds attempted assaults were otherwise entirely unsuccessful.  Federal prosecutors charged Bond with violating, among other things, section 229(a).  Bond moved to dismiss the chemical weapons charges on the ground that the Act violates the
 
Tenth Amendment.  When the District Court denied her motion, she pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal.  The Third Circuit initially held that Bond lacked standing to raise her
 
Tenth Amendment challenge, but this Court reversed.  On remand, the Third Circuit rejected her
 
Tenth Amendment argument and her additional argument that section 229 does not reach her conduct. 
Held:Section 229 does not reach Bonds simple assault.  Pp.821.

        
        (a)The parties debate whether section 229 is a necessary and proper means of executing the Federal Governments power to make treaties, but normally [this] Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case.  Escambia County v. McMillan,

466 U.S. 48
 (per curiam).  Thus, this Court starts with Bonds argument that section 229 does not cover her conduct.  Pp.89.

        
        (b)This Court has no need to interpret the scope of the international Chemical Weapons Convention in this case.  The treaty specifies that a signatory nation should implement its obligations in accordance with its constitutional processes.  Art. VII(1), 1974 U. N. T. S. 331.  Bond was prosecuted under a federal statute, which, unlike the treaty, must be read consistent with the principles of federalism inherent in our constitutional structure.  Pp.1021.

        
        
        
        (1)A fair reading of section 229 must recognize the duty of federal courts to be certain of Congresss intent before finding that federal law overrides the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers, Gregory v. Ashcroft,

501 U.S. 452
.  This principle applies to federal laws that punish local criminal activity, which has traditionally been the responsibility of the States.  This Courts precedents have referred to basic principles of federalism in the Constitution to resolve ambiguity in federal statutes.  See, e.g., United States v. Bass,

404 U.S. 336
; Jones v. United States,

529 U.S. 848
.  Here, the ambiguity in the statute derives from the improbably broad reach of the key statutory definition, given the termchemical weaponthat is being defined, the deeply serious consequences of adopting such a boundless reading, and the lack of any apparent need to do so in light of the context from which the statute arosea treaty about chemical warfare and terrorism, not about local assaults.  Thus, the Court can reasonably insist on a clear indication that Congress intended to reach purely local crimes before interpreting section 229s expansive language in a way that intrudes on the States police power.  Pp.1014.

        
        
        
        (2)No such clear indication is found in section 229.  An ordinary speaker would not describe Bonds feud-driven act of spreading irritating chemicals as involving a chemical weapon.  And the chemicals at issue here bear little resemblance to those whose prohibition was the object of an international Convention.  Where the breadth of a statutory definition creates ambiguity, it is appropriate to look to the ordinary meaning of the term being defined (here, chemical weapon) in settling on a fair reading of the statute.  See Johnson v. United States,

559 U.S. 133
.

        
        The Governments reading of section 229 would transform a statute concerned with acts of war, assassination, and terrorism into a massive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches the simplest of assaults.  In light of the principle that Congress does not normally intrude upon the States police power, this Court is reluctant to conclude that Congress meant to punish Bonds crime with a federal prosecution for a chemical weapons attack.  In fact, only a handful of prosecutions have been brought under section 229, and most of those involved crimes not traditionally within the States purview, e.g., terrorist plots.

        
        Pennsylvanias laws are sufficient to prosecute assaults like Bonds, and there is no indication in section 229 that Congress intended to abandon its traditional reluctan[ce] to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States, Bass, supra, at 349.  That principle goes to the very structure of the Constitution, and protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.  Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  The global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the Federal Government to reach into the kitchen cupboard.  Pp.1521.
681 F.3d 149, reversed and remanded.

Petitioner, Limelight Networks, Inc., also operates a CDN and carries out several of the steps claimed in the patent, but its customers, rather than Limelight itself, perform a step of the patent known as tagging.  Under Federal Circuit case law, liability for direct infringement under

35 U.S.C. 271(a) requires performance of all steps of a method patent to be attributable to a single party.  This position was most recently refined in Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318.  The District Court concluded that Limelight could not have directly infringed the patent at issue because performance of the tagging step could not be attributed to it.  The en banc Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a defendant who performed some steps of a method patent and encouraged others to perform the rest could be liable for inducement of infringement even if no one was liable for direct infringement.  The en banc court concluded that the evidence could support liability for Limelight on an inducement theory and remanded for further proceedings.

NAUTILUS, INC. v. BIOSIG INSTRUMENTS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13369.Argued April 28, 2014Decided June 2, 2014
The Patent Act requires that a patent specification conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as [the] invention.

35 U.S.C. 112, 2.  This case concerns the proper reading of the statutes clarity and precision demand.  

        
        
        
        Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dispute (the 753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exercise equipment.  Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals), generated by the users skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal detection.  The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG interference.  

        
        
        
        Claim 1 of the 753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to this dispute, refers to a heart rate monitor for use by a user in association with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.  The claim comprise[s], among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted with a display device; electronic circuitry including a difference amplifier; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode mounted ... in spaced relationship with each other.  

        
        
        
        Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus, Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing Biosigs patented technology.  The District Court, after conducting a hearing to determine the proper construction of the patents claims, granted Nautilus motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claim term in spaced relationship with each other failed 112, 2s definiteness requirement.  The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded, concluding that a patent claim passes the 112, 2 threshold so long as the claim is amenable to construction, and the claim, as construed, is not insolubly ambiguous.  Under that standard, the court determined, the 753 patent survived indefiniteness review.  
Held: 

        
        1.A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the patents specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.  The parties agree that definiteness is to be evaluated from the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, that claims are to be read in light of the patents specification and prosecution history, and that definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the patent application.  The parties disagree as to how much imprecision 112, 2 tolerates.  

        
        Section 112s definiteness requirement must take into account the inherent limitations of language.  See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.,

535 U.S. 722
.  On the one hand, some modicum of uncertainty is the price of ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation, id., at 732; and patents are not addressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally, but to those skilled in the relevant art, Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co.,

185 U.S. 403
.  At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby appris[ing] the public of what is still open to them, Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,

517 U.S. 370
, in a manner that avoids [a] zone of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of infringement claims, United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co.,

317 U.S. 228
.  The standard adopted here mandates clarity, while recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable.  It also accords with opinions of this Court stating that the certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard to their subject-matter.  Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde,

242 U.S. 261
.  Pp.811.

        
        2.The Federal Circuits standard, which tolerates some ambiguous claims but not others, does not satisfy the statutes definiteness requirement.  The Court of Appeals inquired whether the 753 patents claims were amenable to construction or insolubly ambiguous, but such formulations lack the precision 112, 2 demands.  To tolerate imprecision just short of that rendering a claim insolubly ambiguous would diminish the definiteness requirements public-notice function and foster the innovation-discouraging zone of uncertainty, United Carbon, 317 U.S., at 236, against which this Court has warned.  While some of the Federal Circuits fuller explications of the term insolubly ambiguous may come closer to tracking the statutory prescription, this Court must ensure that the Federal Circuits test is at least probative of the essential inquiry.  Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co.,

520 U.S. 17
.  The expressions insolubly ambiguous and amenable to construction, which permeate the Federal Circuits recent decisions concerning 112, 2, fall short in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without a reliable compass.  Pp.1113.

        
        3.This Court, as a court of review, not of first view, Cutter v. Wilkinson,

544 U.S. 709
, n.7, follows its ordinary practice of remanding so that the Federal Circuit can reconsider, under the proper standard, whether the relevant claims in the 753 patent are sufficiently definite, see, e.g., Johnson v. California,

543 U.S. 499
.  Pp.1314. 
715 F.3d 891, vacated and remanded.

        
        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

HALL v. FLORIDA
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 1210882.Argued March 3, 2014
        
        Decided May 27, 2014
After this Court held that the Eighth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments forbid the execution of persons with intellectual disability, see Atkins v. Virginia,

536 U.S. 304
, Hall asked a Florida state court to vacate his sentence, presenting evidence that included an IQ test score of 71.  The court denied his motion, determining that a Florida statute mandated that he show an IQ score of 70 or below before being permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence.  The State Supreme Court rejected Halls appeal, finding the States 70-point threshold constitutional.
Held:The States threshold requirement, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, is unconstitutional.  Pp.522.

        
        (a)The
 
Eighth Amendment, which reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons, Roper v. Simmons,

543 U.S. 551
, prohibits the execution of persons with intellectual disability.  No legitimate penological purpose is served by executing the intellectually disabled.  Atkins, 563 U.S., at 317, 320.  Prohibiting such executions also protects the integrity of the trial process for individuals who face a special risk of wrongful execution because they are more likely to give false confessions, are often poor witnesses, and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel.  Id., at 320321.  In determining whether Floridas intellectual disability definition implements these principles and Atkins holding, it is proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of IQ scores and how the scores relate to Atkins, and to consider how the several States have implemented Atkins.  Pp.57.

        
        (b)Floridas rule disregards established medical practice.  On its face, Floridas statute could be consistent with the views of the medical community discussed in Atkins and with the conclusions reached here.  It defines intellectual disability as the existence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, long the defining characteristic of intellectual disability.  See Atkins, supra, at 308.  And nothing in the statute precludes Florida from considering an IQ tests standard error of measurement (SEM), a statistical fact reflecting the tests inherent imprecision and acknowledging that an individual score is best understood as a range, e.g., five points on either side of the recorded score.  As interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, however, Floridas rule disregards established medical practice in two interrelated ways: It takes an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendants intellectual capacity, when experts would consider other evidence; and it relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of a defendants abilities, while refusing to recognize that measurements inherent imprecision.  While professionals have long agreed that IQ test scores should be read as a range, Florida uses the test score as a fixed number, thus barring further consideration of other relevant evidence, e.g., deficits in adaptive functioning, including evidence of past performance, environment, and upbringing.  Pp.712.

        
        (c)The rejection of a strict 70-point cutoff in the vast majority of States and a consistency in the trend, Roper, supra, at 567, toward recognizing the SEM provide strong evidence of consensus that society does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane.  At most, nine States mandate a strict IQ score cutoff at 70.  Thus, in 41 States, an individual in Halls position would not be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.  The direction of change has been consistent.  Since Atkins, many States have passed legislation to comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intellectual disability not be executed.  Two of those States appear to set a strict cutoff at 70, but at least 11 others have either abolished the death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present additional intellectual disability evidence when their IQ score is above 70.  Every state legislature, save one, to have considered the issue after Atkins and whose law has been interpreted by its courts has taken a position contrary to Floridas.  Pp.1216.

        
        (d)Atkins acknowledges the inherent error in IQ testing and provides substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.  The States play a critical role in advancing the protections of Atkins and providing this Court with an understanding of how intellectual disability should be measured and assessed, but Atkins did not give them unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitutional protection.  Clinical definitions for intellectual disability which, by their express terms, rejected a strict IQ test score cutoff at 70, and which have long included the SEM, were a fundamental premise of Atkins.  See 536 U.S., at 309, nn. 3, 5.  A fleeting mention of Florida in a citation listing States that had outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled, id., at 315, did not signal the Atkins Courts approval of the States current understanding of its law, which had not yet been interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court to require a strict 70-point cutoff.  Pp.1619.

        
        (e)When a defendants IQ test score falls within the tests acknowledged and inherent margin of error, the defendant must be able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability, including testimony regarding adaptive deficits.  This legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis but is informed by the medical communitys diagnostic framework, which is of particular help here, where no alternative intellectual disability definition is presented, and where this Court and the States have placed substantial reliance on the medical professions expertise.  Pp.1922.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

PLUMHOFF etal. v. RICKARD, a minor child, individually, and as surviving daughterof RICKARD, DECEASED, by andthrough her mother RICKARD, as parent and next friend
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 121117.Argued March 4, 2014Decided May 27, 2014
Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase that came to a temporary halt when Rickard spun out into a parking lot.  Rickard resumed maneuvering his car, and as he continued to use the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car, an officer fired three shots into Rickards car.  Rickard managed to drive away, almost hitting an officer in the process.  Officers fired 12 more shots as Rickard sped away, striking him and his passenger, both of whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered when the car eventually crashed.

        
        
        
        Respondent, Rickards minor daughter, filed a

42 U.S.C. 1983 action, alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied the officers motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, holding that their conduct violated the
 
Fourth Amendment and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.  After finding that it had appellate jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit held that the officers conduct violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  It affirmed the District Courts order, suggesting that it agreed that the officers violated clearly established law. 
Held:

        
        1.The Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under

28 U.S.C. 1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of the district courts.  The general rule that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a final decision[n], and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when it is based on a qualified immunity claim.  Johnson v. Jones,

515 U.S. 304

Syllabus
PLUMHOFF etal. v. RICKARD, a minor child, individually, and as surviving daughterof RICKARD, DECEASED, by andthrough her mother RICKARD, as parent and next friend
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 121117.Argued March 4, 2014Decided May 27, 2014
Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase that came to a temporary halt when Rickard spun out into a parking lot.  Rickard resumed maneuvering his car, and as he continued to use the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car, an officer fired three shots into Rickards car.  Rickard managed to drive away, almost hitting an officer in the process.  Officers fired 12 more shots as Rickard sped away, striking him and his passenger, both of whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered when the car eventually crashed.

        
        
        
        Respondent, Rickards minor daughter, filed a

42 U.S.C. 1983 action, alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied the officers motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, holding that their conduct violated the
 
Fourth Amendment and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.  After finding that it had appellate jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit held that the officers conduct violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  It affirmed the District Courts order, suggesting that it agreed that the officers violated clearly established law. 
Held:

        
        1.The Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under

28 U.S.C. 1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of the district courts.  The general rule that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a final decision[n], and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when it is based on a qualified immunity claim.  Johnson v. Jones,

Syllabus
MICHIGAN v. BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 12515.Argued December 2, 2013Decided May 27, 2014
The State of Michigan, petitioner, entered into a compact with respondent Bay Mills Indian Community pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).  See

25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(1)(C).  The compact authorizes Bay Mills to conduct class III gaming activities (i.e., to operate a casino) on Indian lands located within the States borders, but prohibits it from doing so outside that territory.  Bay Mills later opened a second casino on land it had purchased through a congressionally established land trust.  The Tribe claimed it could operate a casino there because the property qualified as Indian land.  Michigan disagreed and sued the Tribe under 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), which allows a State to enjoin class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact.  The District Court granted the injunction, but the Sixth Circuit vacated.  It held that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit unless Congress provided otherwise, and that 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) only authorized suits to enjoin gaming activity located on Indian lands, whereas Michigans complaint alleged the casino was outside such territory.
Held:Michigans suit against Bay Mills is barred by tribal sovereign immunity.  Pp.421.

        
        (a)As domestic dependent nations, Indian tribes exercise inherent sovereign authority that is subject to plenary control by Congress.  Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,

498 U.S. 505
.  Unless and until Congress acts, the tribes retain their historic sovereign authority.  United States v. Wheeler,

435 U.S. 313
.  Among the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes possesssubject to congressional actionis the common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,

436 U.S. 49
.  That immunity applies whether a suit is brought by a State, see, e.g., Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash.,

433 U.S. 165
, or arises from a tribes commercial activities off Indian lands, see Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,

523 U.S. 751
.  Therefore, unless Congress has unequivocally authorized Michigans suit, C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,

532 U.S. 411
, it must be dismissed.  Pp.48.

        
        (b)IGRAs plain terms do not authorize this suit.  Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) partially abrogates tribal immunity with respect to class III gaming located on Indian lands, but the very premise of Michigans suit is that Bay Mills casino is unlawful because it is outside Indian lands.  Michigan argues that the casino is authorized, licensed, and operated from within the reservation, and that such administrative action constitutes class III gaming activity.  However, numerous other IGRA provisions make clear that class III gaming activity refers to the gambling that goes on in a casino, not the off-site licensing of such games.  See, e.g., 2710(d)(3)(C)(i), (d)(9).  IGRAs history and design also explain why Congress would have authorized a State to enjoin illegal tribal gaming on Indian lands but not on lands subject to the States own sovereign jurisdiction.  Congress adopted IGRA in response to California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,

480 U.S. 202
222, which held that States lacked regulatory authority over gaming on Indian lands but left intact States regulatory power over tribal gaming outside Indian territory.  A State therefore has many tools to enforce its law on state land that it does not possess in Indian territory, including, e.g., bringing a civil or criminal action against tribal officials rather than the tribe itself for conducting illegal gaming.  A State can also use its leverage in negotiating an IGRA compact to bargain for a waiver of the tribes immunity.  Pp.814.

        
        (c)Michigan urges the Court to overrule Kiowa and hold that tribal immunity does not apply to commercial activity outside Indian territory.  However, any departure from precedent demands special justification, Arizona v. Rumsey,

467 U.S. 203
, and Michigan offers nothing more than arguments already rejected in Kiowa.  Kiowa rejected these arguments because it is fundamentally Congresss job to determine whether or how to limit tribal immunity; Congress had restricted tribal immunity in limited circumstances like 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), while in other statutes declaring an intention not to alter it.  523 U.S., at 758.  Kiowa therefore chose to defer to the role Congress may wish to exercise in this important judgment.  Ibid.  Congress has since reflected on Kiowa and decided to retain tribal immunity in a case like this.  Having held that the issue is up to Congress, the Court cannot reverse itself now simply because some may think Congresss conclusion wrong.  Pp.1421.
695 F.3d 406, affirmed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
WOOD etal. v. MOSS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13115.Argued March 26, 2014Decided May 27, 2014
While campaigning for a second term, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage.  Local law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street along the Presidents motorcade route.  When the President made a last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the Jacksonville Inns restaurant before resuming the drive to the cottage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which placed them within weapons range of the President.  The supporters remained in their original location, where a two-story building blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio.  At the direction of two Secret Service agents responsible for the Presidents security, petitioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to a street beyond weapons reach of the President.  The agents did not require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the patio, or go through a security screening.  After the President dined, his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two blocks from the motorcades route, were beyond his sight and hearing. 

        
        
        
        The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the
 
First Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but allowed the supporters to remain in their original location.  The District Court denied the agents motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocutory appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court held that the protesters had failed to state a
 
First Amendment claim under the plead-ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544
, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662
.  Because those decisions were rendered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals granted leave to amend the complaint.  On remand, the protesters supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at presidential appearances.  The District Court denied the agents renewed motion to dismiss.  This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents part could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators.  The Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to qualified immunity because this Courts precedent made clear that the Government may not regulate speech based on its content.
Held:The agents are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp.1118.

        
        (a)Government officials may not exclude from public places persons engaged in peaceful expressive activity solely because the government actor fears, dislikes, or disagrees with the views expressed.  See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,

408 U.S. 92
.  The fundamental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to publicize their views whenever and however and wherever they please.  United States v. Grace,

461 U.S. 171
.  In deciding whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established
 
First Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,

403 U.S. 388
, which involved alleged

The protesters counterarguments are unavailing.  They urge that, had the agents professed interest in the Presidents safety been sincere, the agents would have screened or removed from the premises persons already at the Inn when the President arrived.  But staff, other diners, and Inn guests were on the premises before the agents knew of the Presidents plans, and thus could not have anticipated seeing the President, no less causing harm to him.

Moreover, because individual government officials cannot be held liable in a Bivens suit unless they themselves acted [unconstitutionally], Iqbal, 556 U.S., at 683, this Court declines to infer from alleged instances of misconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten Secret Service policy to suppress disfavored expression, and then attribute that supposed policy to all field-level operatives.

Syllabus
WOOD etal. v. MOSS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13115.Argued March 26, 2014Decided May 27, 2014
While campaigning for a second term, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage.  Local law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street along the Presidents motorcade route.  When the President made a last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the Jacksonville Inns restaurant before resuming the drive to the cottage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which placed them within weapons range of the President.  The supporters remained in their original location, where a two-story building blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio.  At the direction of two Secret Service agents responsible for the Presidents security, petitioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to a street beyond weapons reach of the President.  The agents did not require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the patio, or go through a security screening.  After the President dined, his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two blocks from the motorcades route, were beyond his sight and hearing. 

        
        
        
        The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the
 
First Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but allowed the supporters to remain in their original location.  The District Court denied the agents motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocutory appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court held that the protesters had failed to state a
 
First Amendment claim under the plead-ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544
, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662
.  Because those decisions were rendered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals granted leave to amend the complaint.  On remand, the protesters supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at presidential appearances.  The District Court denied the agents renewed motion to dismiss.  This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents part could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators.  The Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to qualified immunity because this Courts precedent made clear that the Government may not regulate speech based on its content.
Held:The agents are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp.1118.

        
        (a)Government officials may not exclude from public places persons engaged in peaceful expressive activity solely because the government actor fears, dislikes, or disagrees with the views expressed.  See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,

408 U.S. 92
.  The fundamental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to publicize their views whenever and however and wherever they please.  United States v. Grace,

461 U.S. 171
.  In deciding whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established
 
First Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,

403 U.S. 388
, which involved alleged
 
Fourth Amendment violations, extends to
 
First Amendment claims, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.S., at 675.

				SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
			

				ESTEBAN MARTINEZ, PETITIONER v. ILLINOIS
			

				on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
			

				No. 135967.Decided May 27, 2014
			

				
				
				Per Curiam.
			

				
				
				The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May 17, 2010.  His counsel was ready; the State was not.  When the court swore in the jury and invited the State to present its first witness, the State declined to present any evidence.  So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty verdict, and the court granted it.  The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted its motion for a continuance.  The question is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the States attempt to appeal in the hope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.
			

				
				
				The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing the States appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never attached because Martinez was never at risk of conviction.  2013 IL 113475, 39, 990 N.E.2d 215, 224.  Our cases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  Crist v. Bretz, 

437 U.S. 28, 
35 (1978)
; see infra, at 6.  There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected to jeopardy.  And because the trial court found the States evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is equally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.
			

				
				
				We therefore grant Martinezs petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.
			

				I
			

				A
			

				
				
				The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006 on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott.  But Martinezs trial date did not arrive for nearly four years.
				[
					1
				]
				
			

				
				
				The story picks up for present purposes on July 20, 2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial date because it had not located the complaining witnesses, Binion and Scott.  The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court rescheduled Martinezs trial to September 28.  But the State sought another continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had not found Binion and Scott.  The court rescheduled the trial to November 9, and the State reissued subpoenas.  But November 9 came and went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually delayed to the following March 29.  In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott.  When March 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an-other continuance.  It reset the trial date for May 17 and ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.  And the State once more issued subpoenas.
				[
					2
				]
				
			

				
				
				On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott were again nowhere to be found.  At 8:30, when the trial was set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.  The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete jury had been empaneled and told the State that it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case.  When Binion and Scott still had not shown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing the jury a bit longer.  But when all these delays had run out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight.  The State filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing that it was unable to proceed without Binion and Scott.  Tr. 7.  The court denied that motion:
			

				
				
				The case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.  In two months we will then be embarking upon half a decade of pending a Class 3 felony.  Avery Binion, Jr., and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are convicted felons.  One would believe that the Elgin Police Department would know their whereabouts.  They were ordered to be in court today.  The Court will issue body writs for both of these gentlemen.
			

				
				
				In addition, the States list of witnesses indi- cates twelve witnesses.  Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr. Binion, thats ten witnesses.  The Court would anticipate it would take every bit of today and most of tomorrow to get through ten witnesses.  By then the People may have had a chance to execute the arrest warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.
			

				
				
				The Court will deny the motion for continuance.  I will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes.  Perhaps you might want to send the police out to find these two gentlemen.  Id., at 89.
			

				
				
				After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start of the trial for several more hours if the continuance would be of any help to the State.  Id., at 9.  But when the State made clear that Binion and Scotts whereabouts remained unknown, the court concluded that the delay would be a further waste of time.  Id., at 10.  The following colloquy ensued:
			

				
				
				THE COURT: .... Its a quarter to eleven and [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own will, so Im going to bring the jury in now then to swear them.
			

				
				
				[The Prosecutor]: Okay.  Your Honor, may I approach briefly?
			

				
				
				THE COURT: Yes.
			

				
				
				[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is aware, I know that its the process to bring them in and swear them in; however, the State will not be participating in the trial.  I wanted to let you know that.
			

				
				
				THE COURT: Very well.  Well see how that works.  Id., at 1011.
			

				
				
				The jury was then sworn.  After instructing the jury, the court directed the State to proceed with its opening statement.  The prosecutor demurred: Your Honor, respect- fully, the State is not participating in this case.  Id., at 20.  After the defense waived its opening statement, the court directed the State to call its first witness.  Again, the prosecutor demurred: Respectfully, your Honor, the State is not participating in this matter.  Ibid.  The defense then moved for a judgment of acquittal:
			

				
				
				[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.  The State has not presented any evidence.  I believe theyve indicated their intention not to present any evidence or witnesses.
			

				
				
				Based on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag- gravated battery and mob action.
			

				
				
				THE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?
			

				
				
				[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.  Respectfully, the State is not participating.
			

				
				
				THE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for a directed finding and dismiss the charges.  Id., at 21.
			

				B
			

				
				
				The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted a continuance.  Martinez responded that the States appeal was improper because he had been acquitted.  The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State, holding that jeopardy had never attached and that the trial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.  2011 IL App (2d) 100498, 46, 5356, 969 N. E. 2d 840, 854, 856858.
			

				
				
				The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeopardy issue and affirmed.  2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d 215.  It began by recognizing that [g]enerally, in cases of a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is put to trial before the trier of the facts.  Id., 23, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 

420 U.S. 377, 
394 (1975)
).  But it reasoned that under this Courts precedents, rigid, mechanical rules should not govern the inquiry into whether jeopardy has attached.  2013 IL 113475, 24, 990 N.E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 390).  Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether a defendant was subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.  2013 IL 113475, 24, 990 N.E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).
			

				
				
				Here, the court concluded, Martinez was never at risk of convictionand jeopardy therefore did not attachbecause [t]he State indicated it would not participate prior to the jury being sworn.  2013 IL 113475, 39, 990 N.E. 2d, at 224.  And because Martinez was not placed in jeopardy, the court held, the trial courts entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquittals.  Id., 40, 990 N.E. 2d, at 225.  Indeed, the court remarked, the trial court repeatedly referred to its action as a dismissal rather than an acquittal.  Ibid.
			

				
				
				Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majoritys conclusion that impaneling and swearing the jury had no legal significance ran contrary to well-established principles regarding double jeopardy.  Id., 57, 990 N.E. 2d, at 227.  Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez was not in danger of conviction was belied by the actions of the court and the prosecutor.  Id., 63, 990 N.E. 2d, at 229.  She explained that under the majoritys holding, the State could unilaterally render a trial a sham simply by refusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.  Id., 64, 990 N.E. 2d, at 229.
			

				II
			

				
				
				This case presents two issues.  First, did jeopardy attach to Martinez?  Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such a manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?  Our precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer to each question.
			

				A
			

				
				
				There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer than the rule that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  Crist, 437 U.S., at 35; see also United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 

430 U.S. 564, 
569 (1977)
; Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure 25.1(d) (3d ed. 2007).
			

				
				
				Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which addressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute providing that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing of the first witness.  As Crist explains, the precise point at which jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been open to argument before this Courts decision in Downum v. United States, 

372 U.S. 734
 [(1963)], in which the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a second prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had ended just after the jury had been sworn and before any testimony had been taken.  437 U.S., at 35.  But Downum put any such argument to rest: Its holding necessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy attaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit authority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  Crist, supra, at 35.
			

				
				
				The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in suggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other than a bright line at which jeopardy attaches.  It relied on Serfass, understanding that case to mean that in assessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, rigid, mechanical rules should not be applied.  2013 IL 113475, 24, 990 N.E. 2d, at 222.  Under Serfass, the court reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defendant was as a functional matter subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.  2013 IL 113475, 24, 990 N.E. 2d, at 222.
			

				
				
				But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the determination of when jeopardy has attached.  As to that question, it states the same bright-line rule as every other case: Jeopardy attaches when a defendant is put to trial, and in a jury trial, that is when a jury is empaneled and sworn.  420 U.S., at 388.  Indeed, Serfass explicitly rejects a functional approach to the question whether jeopardy has attached.  See id., at 390 (refuting the defendants argument that constructiv[e] jeopardy had attached upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss the indictment, which the defendant characterized as the functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits).  The Serfass Court acknowledged that we have disparaged rigid, mechanical rules in the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Ibid.  But it was referring to the case of Illinois v. Somerville, 

410 U.S. 458 (1973)
, in which we declined to apply rigid, mechanical reasoning in answering a very different question: not whether jeopardy had attached, but whether the manner in which it terminated (by mistrial) barred the defendants retrial.  Id., at 467.  By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy attaches at the start of a trial is by no means a mere technicality, nor is it a rigid, mechanical rule.  420 U.S., at 391.  And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Courts interpretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about when a trial begins.
			

				
				
				The Illinois Supreme Courts error was consequential, for it introduced confusion into what we have consistently treated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeopardy attaches, when the jury is sworn.  We have never suggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme Courtthat jeopardy may not have attached where, under the circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was not genuinely at risk of conviction.
				[
					3
				]
				  Martinez was subjected to jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.
			

				B
			

				
				
				[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached, how- ever, begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.  Id., at 390.  The remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in such a manner that the defendant may not be retried.  See 6 LaFave 25.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which retrial is and is not allowed).  Here, there is no doubt that Martinezs jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his retrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged offenses.  Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that [a] verdict of acquittal ... could not be reviewed ... without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.  Martin Linen, supra, at 571.
			

				
				
				[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecutions proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.  Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 45).  And the trial court clearly made such a ruling here.  After the State declined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel moved for directed findings of not guilty to both counts, and the court grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.  Tr. 21.  That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the States evidence cannot support a conviction.
			

				
				
				The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise.  It first opined that [b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeopardy, the [trial] courts entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquittals.  2013 IL 113475, 40, 990 N.E. 2d, at 225.  But the premise of that argument is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the reasons given above.  The court went on to note that, in directing findings of not guilty, the trial court referred to its action as a dismissal rather than an acquittal.  Ibid.  Under our precedents, however, that is immaterial: [W]e have emphasized that what constitutes an acquittal is not to be controlled by the form of the judges action; it turns on whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution ... of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.  Martin Linen, 430 U.S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (Our decision turns not on the form of the trial courts action, but rather whether it serve[s] substantive purposes or procedural ones); United States v. Scott, 

437 U.S. 82, 
96 (1978)
 (We have previously noted that the trial judges characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action).
			

				
				
				Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial courts action was an acquittal because the court acted on its view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.  Evans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen, supra, at 572 ([T]he District Court in this case evaluated the Governments evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction).  And because Martinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him.

				The functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors or to the public.  On the day of trial, the court was acutely aware of the significance of swearing a jury.  It repeatedly delayed that act to give the State additional time to find its witnesses.  It had previously granted the State a number of continuances for the same purpose.  See supra, at 2.  And, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial that it could move to dismiss [its] case before the jury was sworn.  Tr. 3.  Had the State accepted that invitation, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from recharging Martinez.  Instead, the State participated in the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the jury was sworn.  When the State declined to dismiss its case, it took a chance[,] ... enter[ing] upon the trial of the case without sufficient evidence to convict.  Downum v. United States, 

372 U.S. 734, 
737 (1963)
.  Here, the State knew, or should have known, that an acquittal forever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs after jeopardy has attached.  The Illinois Supreme Courts holding is understandable, given the significant consequence of the States mistake, but it runs directly counter to our precedents and to the protection conferred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

				The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
			

				It is so ordered.

			Martinez was indicted in 2006 on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against the state. After significant delays, caused by both sides, his trial was set to begin on May 17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the prosecution was not because it was unable to locate its complaining witnesses. The court delayed swearing the jurors, but ultimately told the state that it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case.  After several hours, the court swore in the jury and asked the state to present its first witness.  It declined to present any evidence or participate in the trial. Martinez successfully moved for a directed not-guilty verdict. The court rejected a motion for a continuance, noting that the prosecution had named other witnesses and that the missing witnesses should have been relatively easy to locate. The Illinois Supreme Court allowed the states appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never attached because Martinez was never at risk of conviction. The Supreme Court reversed, citing the bright-line rule that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  Martinez may not be retried.

PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 121315.Argued January 21, 2014Decided May 19, 2014
The Copyright Act (Act) protects copyrighted works published before 1978 for an initial period of 28 years, renewable for a period of up to 67 years.

17 U.S.C. 304(a).  The authors heirs inherit the renewal rights.  See 304(a)(1)(C)(ii)(iv).  When an author who has assigned her rights away dies before the renewal period, ... the assignee may continue to use the original work only if the authors successor transfers the renewal rights to the assignee, Stewart v. Abend,

495 U.S. 207
.  The Act provides both equitable and legal remedies for infringement: an injunction on such terms as [a court] may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright, 502(a); and, at the copyright owners election, either (1) the owners actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer, 504(a)(1), which petitioner seeks in this case, or (2) specified statutory damages, 504(c).  The Acts statute of limitations provides: No civil action shall be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.  507(b).  A claim ordinarily accrues when an infringing act occurs.  Under the separate-accrual rule that attends the copyright statute of limitations, when a defendant has committed successive violations, each infringing act starts a new limitations period.  However, under 507(b), each infringement is actionable only within three years of its occurrence.

        
        
        
        Here, the allegedly infringing work is the motion picture Raging Bull, based on the life of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who, with Frank Petrella, told his story in, inter alia, a screenplay copyrighted in 1963.  In 1976, the pair assigned their rights and renewal rights, which were later acquired by respondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM).  In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging Bull, and it continues to market the film today.  Frank Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights reverted to his heirs.  Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella (Petrella), his daughter, renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991, becoming its sole owner.  Seven years later, she advised MGM that its exploitation of Raging Bull violated her copyright and threatened suit.  Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, she filed an infringement suit, seeking monetary and injunctive relief limited to acts of infringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006.  Invoking the equitable doctrine of laches, MGM moved for summary judgment.  Petrellas 18-year delay in filing suit, MGM argued, was unreasonable and prejudicial to MGM.  The District Court granted MGMs motion, holding that laches barred Petrellas complaint.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:

        
        1.Laches cannot be invoked as a bar to Petrellas pursuit of a claim for damages brought within 507(b)s three-year window.  Pp.1119.

        
        
        
        (a)By permitting a successful plaintiff to gain retrospective relief only three years back from the time of suit, the copyright statute of limitations itself takes account of delay.  Brought to bear here, 507(b) directs that Petrella cannot reach MGMs returns on its investment in Raging Bull in years before 2006.  Moreover, if infringement within the three-year window is shown, a defendant may offset against profits made in that period expenses incurred in generating those profits.  See 504(b).  In addition, a defendant may retain the return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise, as distinct from the value created by the infringed work.  See ibid.  Both before and after the merger of law and equity in 1938, this Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief.  See, e.g., Holmberg v. Armbrecht,

327 U.S. 392
.  Pp.1114.

        
        
        
        (b)MGMs principal arguments regarding the contemporary scope of the laches defense are unavailing.  Pp.1419.

        
        
        
        
        
        (1)MGM urges that, because laches is listed in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) as an affirmative defense discrete from a statute of limitations defense, the plea should be available ... in every civil action to bar all forms of relief.  Such an expansive role careens away from understandings, past and present, of the essentially gap-filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches.  This Court has never applied laches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period.  Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other than the one Congress prescribed would tug against the uniformity Congress sought to achieve in enacting 507(b).  Pp.1415.

        
        
        
        
        
        (2)MGM contends that laches, like equitable tolling, should be read into every federal statute of limitation, Holmberg, 327 U.S., at 397.  However, tolling lengthens the time for commencing a civil action where there is a statute of limitations and is, in effect, a rule of interpretation tied to that statutory limit.  See, e.g., Young v. United States,

535 U.S. 43
50.  In contrast, laches, which originally served as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled, can scarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescription.  Pp.1516.

        
        
        
        
        
        (3)MGM insists that the laches defense must be available to prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing nothing, waiting to see what the outcome of an alleged infringers investment will be.  It is hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to challenge each and every actionable infringement.  And there is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an infringers exploitation undercuts the value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on that work, or even complements it.  Section 507(b)s limitations period, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle.  Pp.1617.

        
        
        
        
        
        (4)MGM is concerned that evidence needed or useful to defend against liability will be lost during a copyright owners inaction.  But Congress must have been aware that the passage of time and the authors death could cause evidentiary issues when it provided for reversionary renewal rights that an authors heirs can exercise long after a work was written and copyrighted.  Moreover, because a copyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement, any hindrance caused by evidence unavailability is as likely to affect plaintiffs as defendants.  The need for extrinsic evidence is also reduced by the registration mechanism, under which both the certificate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office before a copyright owner can sue for infringement.  Pp.1718.

        
        
        
        
        
        (5)Finally, when a copyright owner engages in intentionally misleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and the alleged infringer detrimentally relies on such deception, the doctrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owners claims completely, eliminating all potential remedies.  The gravamen of estoppel, a defense long recognized as available in actions at law, is wrongdoing, overt misleading, and consequent loss.  Estoppel does not undermine the statute of limitations, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged in early on, or later in time.  P.19.

        
        2.While laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the Acts three-year window, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the litigation, curtail the relief equitably awarded.  For example, where owners of a copyrighted architectural design, although aware of an allegedly infringing housing project, delayed suit until the project was substantially constructed and partially occupied, an order mandating destruction of the project would not be tolerable.  See Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F.3d 227, 236.  Nor, in the face of an unexplained delay in commencing suit, would it be equitable to order total destruction of a book already printed, packed, and shipped.  See New Era Publications Intl v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F.2d 576, 584585.  No such extraordinary circumstance is present here.  Petrella notified MGM of her copyright claims before MGM invested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull, and the equitable relief she seekse.g., disgorgement of unjust gains and an injunction against future infringementwould not result in anything like total destruction of the film.  Allowing Petrellas suit to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has earned during the more than three decades Raging Bull has been marketed and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties.  Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the District Court, in determining appropriate injunctive relief and assessing profits, may take account of Petrellas delay in commencing suit.  In doing so, however, the court must closely examine MGMs alleged reliance on Petrellas delay, taking account of MGMs early knowledge of her claims, the protection MGM might have achieved through a declaratory judgment action, the extent to which MGMs investment was protected by the separate-accrual rule, the courts authority to order injunctive relief on such terms as it may deem reasonable, 502(a), and any other relevant considerations.  Pp.1922.
695 F.3d 946, reversed and remanded.

        
        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J., joined.

			The Copyright Act protects works published before 1978 for 28 years, renewable for up to 67 years, 17 U.S.C. 304(a). An authors heirs inherit renewal rights. If an author who has assigned rights dies before the renewal period the assignee may continue to use the work only if the authors successor transfers renewal rights to the assignee. The Act provides for injunctive relief and damages. Civil actions must be commenced within three years after the claim accrued-ordinarily when an infringing act occurred. Under the separate-accrual rule, each successive violation starts a new limitations period, but is actionable only within three years of its occurrence. The movie, Raging Bull, is based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta, who, with Petrella, told his story in a screenplay copyrighted in 1963. In 1976 they assigned their rights and renewal rights to MGM. In 1980 MGM released, and registered a copyright in, Raging Bull. Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights reverted to his daughter, who renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991. Seven years later, she advised MGM that it was violating her copyright. Nine years later she filed suit, seeking damages and injunctive relief for violations occurring after January 5, 2006. The district court dismissed, citing laches. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed.  Laches cannot bar a claim for damages brought within the three-year window. By permitting retrospective relief only three years back, the limitations period takes account of delay.  Noting the essentially gap-filling, not legislation-overriding, nature of laches, the Court stated that it has never applied laches to entirely bar claims for discrete wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period. It is not incumbent on copyright owners to challenge every actionable infringement; there is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether a violation undercuts the value of the copyrighted work, has no effect, or even complements the work. The limitations period, with the separate-accrual rule, allows an owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the effort.  Because a plaintiff bears the burden of proof, evidence unavailability is as likely to affect plaintiffs as defendants.  The Court noted that in some circumstances, the equitable defense of estoppel might limit remedies. Allowing this suit to proceed will put at risk only a fraction of what MGM has earned from Raging Bull and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties. Should Petrella prevail on the merits, the court may fashion a remedy taking account of the delay and MGMs alleged reliance on that delay.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
TOWN OF GREECE, NEW YORK v. GALLOWAY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 12696.Argued November 6, 2013Decided May 5, 2014
Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York, have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in a local directory.  While the prayer program is open to all creeds, nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of the participating prayer givers have been too.  Respondents, citizens who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that the town violated the
 
First Amendments Establishment Clause by preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers.  They sought to limit the town to inclusive and ecumenical prayers that referred only to a generic God.  The District Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Christian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly Christian character of the towns congregations, not an official policy or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the
 
First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and rejecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.  
Held:The judgment is reversed.
681 F.3d 20, reversed.

        
        Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIB, concluding that the towns prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.618.

        
        (a)Legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause.  Marsh v. Chambers,

463 U.S. 783
.  In Marsh, the Court concluded that it was not necessary to define the Establishment Clauses precise boundary in order to uphold Nebraskas practice of employing a legislative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the specific practice was permitted.  The First Congress voted to appoint and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the
 
First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since then.  See id., at 787789, and n.10.  A majority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative prayer.  Id., at 788790, and n.11.  There is historical precedent for the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.  Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings.  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,

492 U.S. 573
 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Thus, any test must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.  The Courts inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.  Pp.69.

        
        (b)Respondents insistence on nonsectarian prayer is not consistent with this tradition.  The prayers in Marsh were consistent with the
 
First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic theism but because the Nations history and tradition have shown that prayer in this limited context could coexis[t] with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom.  463 U.S., at 786.  Dictum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only prayer with no overtly Christian references is irreconcilable with the facts, holding, and reasoning of Marsh, which instructed that the content of the prayer is not of concern to judges, provided there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.  463 U.S., at 794795.  To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, thus involving government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the towns current practice of neither editing nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.  Respondents contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  It is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies as a generic or nonsectarian prayer.  It would also be unwise to conclude that only those religious words acceptable to the majority are permis-sible, for the
 
First Amendment is not a majority rule and government may not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech.  In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content.  The relevant constraint derives from the prayers place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nations heritage.  From the Nations earliest days, invocations have been addressed to assemblies comprising many different creeds, striving for the idea that people of many faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion, even if they disagree as to religious doctrine.  The prayers delivered in Greece do not fall outside this tradition.  They may have invoked, e.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g., by calling for a spirit of cooperation.  Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.  See 463 U.S., at 794795.  Finally, so long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.  Pp.918.

        
        Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IIB that a fact-sensitive inquiry that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed shows that the town is not coercing its citizens to engage in a religious observance.  The prayer opportunity is evaluated against the backdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has become part of the Nations heritage and tradition.  It is presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and understands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many private citizens.  Furthermore, the principal audience for these invocations is not the public, but the lawmakers themselves.  And those lawmakers did not direct the public to participate, single out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicate that their decisions might be influenced by a persons acquiescence in the prayer opportunity.  Respondents claim that the prayers gave them offense and made them feel excluded and disrespected, but offense does not equate to coercion.  In contrast to Lee v. Weisman,

505 U.S. 577
, where the Court found coercive a religious invocation at a high school graduation, id., at 592594, the record here does not suggest that citizens are dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the prayer, arriving late, or making a later protest.  That the prayer in Greece is delivered during the opening ceremonial portion of the towns meeting, not the policymaking portion, also suggests that its purpose and effect are to acknowledge religious leaders and their institutions, not to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.  Pp.1823.

        
        Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia as to Part II, agreed that the towns prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause, but concluded that, even if the Establishment Clause were properly incorporated against the States through the
 
Fourteenth Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the kind of subtle pressures respondents allegedly suffered, which do not amount to actual legal coercion.  The municipal prayers in this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding, which exercised government power in order to exact financial support of the church, compel religious observance, or control religious doctrine.

Syllabus
TOWN OF GREECE, NEW YORK v. GALLOWAY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 12696.Argued November 6, 2013Decided May 5, 2014
Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York, have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in a local directory.  While the prayer program is open to all creeds, nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of the participating prayer givers have been too.  Respondents, citizens who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that the town violated the
 
First Amendments Establishment Clause by preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers.  They sought to limit the town to inclusive and ecumenical prayers that referred only to a generic God.  The District Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Christian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly Christian character of the towns congregations, not an official policy or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the
 
First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and rejecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.  
Held:The judgment is reversed.
681 F.3d 20, reversed.

        
        Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIB, concluding that the towns prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.618.

        
        (a)Legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause.  Marsh v. Chambers,

463 U.S. 783
.  In Marsh, the Court concluded that it was not necessary to define the Establishment Clauses precise boundary in order to uphold Nebraskas practice of employing a legislative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the specific practice was permitted.  The First Congress voted to appoint and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the
 
First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since then.  See id., at 787789, and n.10.  A majority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative prayer.  Id., at 788790, and n.11.  There is historical precedent for the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.  Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings.  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,

492 U.S. 573
 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Thus, any test must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.  The Courts inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.  Pp.69.

First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic theism but because the Nations history and tradition have shown that prayer in this limited context could coexis[t] with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom.  463 U.S., at 786.

ROBERS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 129012.Argued February 25, 2014Decided May 5, 2014
Petitioner Robers was convicted of a federal crime for submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks.  On appeal, he argued that the District Court had miscalculated his restitution obligation under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. 3663A3664, a provision of which requires property crime offenders to pay an amount equal to ... the value of the property less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned, 3663A(b)(1)(B).  The District Court had ordered Robers to pay the difference between the amount lent to him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that had served as collateral for the loans.  Robers claimed that the District Court should have instead reduced the restitution amount by the value of the houses on the date the banks took title to them since that was when part of the property was returned.  The Seventh Circuit rejected Robers argument.
Held:The phrase any part of the property ... returned refers to the property the banks lost, namely, the money they lent to Robers, and not to the collateral the banks received, namely, the houses.  Read naturally, the words the property, which appear seven times in 3663A(b)(1), refer to the property that was lost as a result of the crime, here, the money.  Because [g]enerally, identical words used in different parts of the same statute are ... presumed to have the same meaning, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit,

547 U. S. 71
 (quoting IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,

546 U. S. 21
), the property ... returned must also be the property lost as a result of the crime.  Any awkwardness or redundancy that comes from substituting an amount of money for the words the property is the linguistic price paid for having a single statutory provision that covers different kinds of property.  Since valuing money is easier than valuing other types of property, the natural reading also facilitates the statutes administration.

        
        
        
        Robers contrary arguments are unconvincing.  First, other provisions of the statute, see, e.g., 3664(f)(2), (3)(A), (4), seem to give courts adequate authority to avoid Robers false dichotomy of having to choose between refusing to award restitution and requiring the offender to pay the full amount lent where a victim has not sold the collateral by the time of sentencing.  Second, for purposes of the statutes proximate-cause requirement, see 3663A(a)(2), 3664(e), normal market fluctuations do not break the causal chain between the offenders fraud and the losses incurred by the victim.  Third, even assuming that the return of collateral compensates lenders for their losses under state mortgage law, the issue here is whether the statutory provision, which does not purport to track state mortgage law, requires that collateral received be valued at the time the victim received it.  Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here.  See Muscarello v. United States,

524 U.S. 125
.  Pp.37.
698 F.3d 937, affirmed.

13-551|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ROBERT R. TOLAN v. JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 13551.Decided May 5, 2014


        
        Per Curiam.

        
        During the early morning hours of New Years Eve, 2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolans right lung.  At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from Cotton.  Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right.  713 F. 3d 299 (2013).  In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, [t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,

477 U.S. 242,
255 (1986)
.  For that reason, we vacate its decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
I
A

        
        The following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below.  At around 2:00 on the morning of December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential street.  The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house.  Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.

        
        Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car.  But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK.  That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make.  This match caused the squad cars computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.

        
        Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground.  He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car.  Cooper responded, Thats not true.  Record 1295.  And Tolan explained, Thats my car.  Ibid.  Tolan then complied with the officers demand to lie face-down on the homes front porch.

        
        As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents.  Hearing the commotion, Tolans parents exited the front door in their paja-mas.  In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolans father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing.  Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.

        
        Edwards told Tolans parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle.  In response, Tolans father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolans mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed.  Tolans father explained, with his hands in the air, [T]his is my nephew.  This is my son.  We live here.  This is my house.  Id., at 2059.  Tolans mother similarly offered, [S]ir this is a big mistake.  This car is not stolen. ... Thats our car.  Id., at 2075.

        
        While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance.  Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol.  Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle.  Tolans mother reiter-ated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding.  Cotton then ordered her to stand against the familys garage door.  In response to Cottons order, Tolans mother asked, [A]re you kidding me?  Weve lived her[e] 15 years.  Weve never had anything like this happen before.  Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.

        
        The parties disagree as to what happened next.  Tolans mother and Cooper testified during Cottons criminal trial[1] that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground.  Id., at 2035, 20782080.  Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door.  Id., at 2479.  In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days.  Id., at 20782079, 20892091.  By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her.  Id., at 1043.  He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.  Id., at 1044.

        
        The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded.  Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.  Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.  Id., at 10511052, 1121.

        
        Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F.3d, at 303, [G]et your fucking hands off my mom.  Record 1928.  The parties also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan.  Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning.  Id., at 2019, 2080.  One of the bullets entered Tolans chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver.  While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.
B

        
        In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolans parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev. Stat. 1979,

42 U.S.C. 1983.  Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment.[2]  After discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.  That doctrine immunizes government officials from damages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly established right.

        
        The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton.  854 F.Supp. 2d 444 (SD Tex. 2012).  It reasoned that Cottons use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 477478.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis.  713 F.3d 299.  It declined to decide whether Cottons actions violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Instead, it held that even if Cottons conduct did violate the
 
Fourth Amendment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate a clearly established right.  Id., at 306.

        
        In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, it was ... clearly established that an officer had the right to use deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an immediate threat to [his] safety.  Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v. Marcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)).  The Courtof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the qualified-immunity bar because an objectively-reasonable officer in Sergeant Cottons position could have ... believed that Tolan presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.  713 F.3d, at 307.[3]  In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been dimly-lit; Tolans mother had refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm; and Tolans words had amounted to a verba[l] threa[t].  Ibid.  Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was moving to intervene in Cottons handling of his mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307.  Accord-ingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan.

        
        The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  538 Fed. Appx. 374 (2013).  Three judges voted to grant rehearing.  Judge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel opinion fail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine issues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in Cottons position could have reasonably and objectively believed that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant threat of substantial injury to him.  Id., at 377.

A

        
        In resolving questions of qualified immunity at summary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.  The first asks whether the facts, [t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, ... show the officers conduct violated a [federal] right[.]  Saucier v. Katz,

533 U.S. 194,
201 (2001)
.  When a plaintiff alleges excessive force during an investigation or arrest, the federal right at issue is the
 
Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures.  Graham v. Connor,

490 U.S. 386,
394 (1989)
.  The inquiry into whether this right was violated requires a balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individuals
 
Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.  Tennessee v. Garner,

471 U.S. 1,
8 (1985)
; see Graham, supra, at 396.

        
        The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis asks whether the right in question was clearly established at the time of the violation.  Hope v. Pelzer,

536 U.S. 730,
739 (2002)
.  Governmental actors are shielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Ibid.  [T]he salient question ... is whether the state of the law at the time of an incident provided fair warning to the defendants that their alleged [conduct] was unconstitutional.  Id., at 741.

        
         Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage these two prongs.  Pearson v. Callahan,

555 U.S. 223,
236 (2009)
.  But under either prong, courts may not resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment.  See Brosseau v. Haugen,

543 U.S. 194,
195, n.
2 (2004)
 (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at 201; Hope, supra, at 733, n.1.  This is not a rule specific to qualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more general rule that a judges function at summary judgment is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.  Anderson, 477 U.S., at 249.  Summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  In making that determination, a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party.  Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co.,

398 U.S. 144,
157 (1970)
; see also Anderson, supra, at 255.

        
        Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance of drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even when, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established prong of the standard.  In cases alleging unreasonable searches or seizures, we have instructed that courts should define the clearly established right at issue on the basis of the specific context of the case.  Saucier, supra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton,

483 U.S. 635
641 (1987).  Accordingly, courts must take care not to define a cases context in a manner that imports genuinely disputed factual propositions.  See Brosseau, supra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated clearly established law in light of the specific contextof the case and construing facts ... in a light most favorable to the nonmovant).
B

        
        In holding that Cottons actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case.  By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly weigh[ed] the evidence and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party, Anderson, 477 U.S., at 249.

        
        First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans front porch was dimly-lit.  713 F.3d, at 307.  The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cottons statements in a deposition that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was fairly dark, and lit by a gas lamp that was decorative.  Id., at 302.  In his own deposition, however, Tolans father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact more decorative than illuminating.  Record 1552.  He said that it was not.  Ibid.  Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,at 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house.  Id., at 1034.  And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was not in darkness.  Id., at 24982499.

        
        Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolans mother refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm, thereby compound[ing] Cottons belief that Tolan presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.  713 F.3d, at 307 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence.  Al-though the parties agree that Tolans mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information.  Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolans mother was very agitated when she spoke to the officers.  Record 10321033.  By contrast, Tolans mother testified at Cottons criminal trial that she was neither aggravated nor agitated.  Id., at 2075, 2077.

        
        Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was shouting, 713 F.3d, at 306, 308, and verbally threatening the officer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.  The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, [G]et your fucking hands off my mom.  Record 1928.  But Tolan testified that he was not screaming.  Id., at 2544.  And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm.  Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5 2001) (A threat imports [a] communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm (quoting Blacks Law Dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F.3d 1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words Why was you talking to Mama that way did not constitute an overt threa[t]).  Tolans mother testified in Cottons criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.  Record 20782079.  A jury could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolans words not as a threat, but as a sons plea not to continue any assault of his mother.

        
        Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was moving to intervene in Sergeant Cottons interaction with his mother.  713 F.3d, at305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolans behavioras abruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton, thereby inflam[ing] an already tense situation).  The court appears to have credited Edwards account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet [i]n a crouch or a charging position looking as if he was going to move forward.  Record 11211122.  Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at 2081.  Tolan also testified in his deposition that he wasnt going anywhere, id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did not jump up, id., at 2544.

        
        Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion.  And while this Court is not equipped to correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal courts, Boag v. MacDougall

454 U.S. 364,
366 (1982)
 (OConnor, J., concurring),  we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents.  Cf. Brosseau, 543 U.S., at 197198 (summarily reversing decision in a
 
Fourth Amendment excessive force case to correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity standard); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn.,

450 U.S. 147,
150 (1981)
 (per curiam) (summarily reversing an opinion that could not be reconciled with the principles set out in this Courts sovereign immunity jurisprudence).

        
        The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.  It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system.  By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolans competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.

        
        Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolans evidence with regardto the lighting, his mothers demeanor, whether he shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioningduring the shooting.  This is not to say, of course, that these are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officers actions as a matter of law.  Nor do we express a view as to whether Cottons actions vio-lated clearly established law.  We instead vacate the Fifth Circuits judgment so that the court can determine whether, when Tolans evidence is properly credited and factual inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cottons actions violated clearly established law.

        The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Funds motion to file an amicus curiae brief are granted.

			At 2:00 a.m., December 31, 2008, Officer Edwards was patrolling Bellaire, Texas. He saw a black Nissan SUV park in front of a house; Tolan and Cooper emerged. Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number into his squad car computer, but entered an incorrect character that matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make, which triggered an automatic alert to other police units. Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his gun and ordered the men to the ground. Accused of having stolen the car, Cooper responded, Thats not true and Tolan stated, Thats my car. Tolan laid down on the porch of the home where he lived with his parents, who came outside.  Tolans father told Cooper to lie down, then identified Tolan and Cooper (his nephew). Tolans mother stated that the vehicle belonged to the family. Sergeant Cotton arrived and drew his pistol. Tolans mother reiterated that they owned the car. Cotton ordered her to stand against the garage. She responded, [A]re you kidding me? Weve lived her[e] 15 years.  Tolan, his mother, and Cooper later testified that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage with such force that she fell to the ground. There was photographic evidence of bruises on her arms and back. Cotton testified that he was escorting her to the garage, when she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her. Tolan testified that, seeing his mother being pushed, he rose to his knees.  Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.  All agree that Tolan exclaimed, [G]et your fucking hands off my mom.  Cotton drew his pistol and fired at Tolan, hitting Tolans chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. He survived, but suffered an injury that disrupted his budding baseball career and causes him pain on a daily basis.  Dismissing a suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the district court found that Cottons use of force was not unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court vacated. In holding that Cottons actions did not violate clearly-established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Tolan as required on summary judgment; it failed to credit evidence that contradicted key factual conclusions, concerning whether the porch was dimly-lit, whether Tolans mother refused to remain calm, whether Tolan was verbally threatening, and whether Tolan was moving to intervene.

			The Patent Act provides: The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party, 35 U.S.C. 285. The Federal Circuit has interpreted section 285 as authorizing fee awards only when there has been some material inappropriate conduct, or when it is both brought in subjective bad faith and objectively baseless. A health insurance company obtained a declaratory judgment that a patent was invalid and not infringed. The district court found the case exceptional and awarded attorney fees of $4,694,727.40, $209,626.56 in expenses, and $375,400.05 in expert fees. The court found a pattern of vexatious and deceitful conduct by the defendant in attempting to force other companies to purchase licenses, even after its own experts determined that its claims lacked merit. The Federal Circuit reviewed the determination de novo and reversed in part. A unanimous Supreme Court vacated. All aspects of a district courts exceptional-case determination should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. That determination is based on statutory text that emphasizes that the district court is better positioned to make the multifarious and novel determination, which is not susceptible to useful generalization of the sort that de novo review provides, and is likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of discretion rule will permit to develop. The word exceptional should be given its ordinary meaning: one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a partys litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated, considering the totality of the circumstances.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal. v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 121182.Argued December 10, 2013Decided April 29, 2014[1]
Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) have, over the course of several decades, made many efforts to deal with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in upwind States, but causing harm in other, downwind States.  As relevant here, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health.  42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  Once EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Agency must designate nonattainment areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated pollutant exceeds the NAAQS.  7407(d).  Each State must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS.  7410(a)(1).  From the date EPA determines that a State SIP is inadequate, the Agency has two years to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP.  7410(c)(1).  Among other components, the CAA mandates SIP compliance with the Good Neighbor Provision, which requires SIPs to contain adequate provisions ... prohibiting ... any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will ... contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any ... [NAAQS].  7410(a)(2)(D)(i).  

        
        
        
        Several times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provisions scope by identifying when upwind States contribute significantly to nonattainment downwind.  The D.C. Circuit found fault with the Agencys 2005 attempt, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which regulated both nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the gasses at issue here.  The D.C. Circuit nevertheless left CAIR temporarily in place, while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in dealing with problems the court had identified.  
        
        

        
        
        
        EPAs response to that decision is the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (Transport Rule), which curbs NOX and SO2 emissions in 27 upwind States to achieve downwind attainment of three NAAQS.  Under the Transport Rule, an upwind State contribute[d] significantly to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined by EPA.  Upwind States are obliged to eliminate only emissions meeting both of these criteria.  Through complex modeling, EPA created an annual emissions budget for each regulated State upwind, representing the total quantity of pollution an upwind State could produce in a given year under the Transport Rule.  Having earlier determined each regulated States SIP to be inadequate, EPA, contemporaneous with the Transport Rule, promulgated FIPs allocating each States emissions budgets among its in-state pollution sources.  

        
        
        
        A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in the D.C. Circuit.  The court vacated the rule in its entirety, holding that EPAs actions exceeded the Agencys statutory authority in two respects.  Acknowledging that EPAs FIP authority is generally triggered when the Agency disapproves a SIP, the court was nevertheless concerned that States would be incapable of fulfilling the Good Neighbor Provision without prior EPA guidance.  The court thus concluded that EPA must give States a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets before issuing FIPs.  The court also found the Agencys two-part interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision unreasonable, concluding that EPA must disregard costs and consider exclusively each upwind States physically proportionate responsibility for air quality problems downwind.
Held: 

        
        1.The CAA does not command that States be given a second opportunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified the States interstate pollution obligations.  Pp.1318.

        
        
        
        (a)The State respondents do not challenge EPAs disapproval of any particular SIP.  Instead, they argue that, notwithstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was still obliged to grant upwind States anadditional opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs after EPA had set the States emission budget.  This claim does not turn on the validity of the prior SIP disapprovals, but on whether the CAA requires EPA do more than disapprove a SIP to trigger the Agencys authority to issue a FIP.  Pp.1314.

        
        
        
        (b)The CAAs plain text supports the Agency: Disapproval of a SIP, without more, triggers EPAs obligation to issue a FIP.  The statute sets precise deadlines for the States and EPA.  Once EPA issues any new or revised NAAQS, a State shall propose a SIP within three years,

42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(1), and that SIP shall include, inter alia, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, 7410(a)(2).  If the EPA finds a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a statutory duty to issue a FIP at any time within two years.  7410(c)(1).  However sensible the D.C. Circuits exception to this strict time prescription may be, a reviewing courts task is to apply the text [of the statute], not to improve upon it.  Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp.,

493 U.S. 120
.  Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several other matters a State must address in its SIP.  Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on EPAs having first quantified an upwind States good neighbor obligations.  By altering Congress SIP and FIP schedule, the D.C. Circuit allowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an information submission obligation on EPA Congress did not impose.  Pp.1417.

        
        
        
        (c)The fact that EPA had previously accorded upwind States a chance to allocate emission budgets among their in-state sources does not show that the Agency acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so here.  EPA retained discretion to alter its course provided it gave a reasonable explanation for doing so.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,

        EPAs chosen allocation method is a permissible construction of the statute.  Chevron, 467 U.S., at 843.  The Agency, tasked with choosing which among equal amounts to eliminate, has chosen sensibly to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to eradicate.  The Industry respondents argue that the final calculation cannot rely on costs, but nothing in the Good Neighbor Provisions text precludes that choice.  And using costs in the Transport Rule calculus is an efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good Neighbor Provision compels the Agency to address.  Efficient because EPA can achieve the same levels of attainment, i.e., of emission reductions, the proportional approach aims to achieve, but at a much lower overall cost.  Equitable because, by imposing uniform cost thresholds on regulated States, EPAs rule subjects to stricter regulation those States that have done less in the past to control their pollution.  Pp.2028.

        
        
        
        (c)Wholesale invalidation of the Transport Rule is not justified by either of the D.C. Circuits remaining objections: that the Transport Rule leaves open the possibility that a State might be compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every affected downwind State is in attainment, so-called over-control; and that EPAs use of costs does not foreclose the possibility that an upwind State would be required to reduce its emissions by so muchthat the State would be placed below the one-percent mark EPA set as the initial threshold of significan[ce].  First, instances of over-control in particular downwind locations may be incidental to reductions necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere.  As the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in every downwind State, however, exceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as over-control unless unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind State.  Second, the EPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate to balance the possibilities of over-control and under-control, i.e., to maximize achievement of attainment downwind.  Finally, in a voluminous record, involving thousands of upwind-to-downwind linkages, respondents point to only a few instances of unnecessary emission reductions, and even those are contested by EPA.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal. v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 121182.Argued December 10, 2013Decided April 29, 2014[1]
Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) have, over the course of several decades, made many efforts to deal with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in upwind States, but causing harm in other, downwind States.  As relevant here, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health.  42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  Once EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Agency must designate nonattainment areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated pollutant exceeds the NAAQS.  7407(d).  Each State must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS.  7410(a)(1).  From the date EPA determines that a State SIP is inadequate, the Agency has two years to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP.  7410(c)(1).  Among other components, the CAA mandates SIP compliance with the Good Neighbor Provision, which requires SIPs to contain adequate provisions ... prohibiting ... any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will ... contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any ... [NAAQS].  7410(a)(2)(D)(i).  

        
        
        
        Several times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provisions scope by identifying when upwind States contribute significantly to nonattainment downwind.  The D.C. Circuit found fault with the Agencys 2005 attempt, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which regulated both nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the gasses at issue here.  The D.C. Circuit nevertheless left CAIR temporarily in place, while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in dealing with problems the court had identified.  
        
        

        
        
        
        EPAs response to that decision is the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (Transport Rule), which curbs NOX and SO2 emissions in 27 upwind States to achieve downwind attainment of three NAAQS.  Under the Transport Rule, an upwind State contribute[d] significantly to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined by EPA.  Upwind States are obliged to eliminate only emissions meeting both of these criteria.  Through complex modeling, EPA created an annual emissions budget for each regulated State upwind, representing the total quantity of pollution an upwind State could produce in a given year under the Transport Rule.  Having earlier determined each regulated States SIP to be inadequate, EPA, contemporaneous with the Transport Rule, promulgated FIPs allocating each States emissions budgets among its in-state pollution sources.  

        
        
        
        A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in the D.C. Circuit.  The court vacated the rule in its entirety, holding that EPAs actions exceeded the Agencys statutory authority in two respects.  Acknowledging that EPAs FIP authority is generally triggered when the Agency disapproves a SIP, the court was nevertheless concerned that States would be incapable of fulfilling the Good Neighbor Provision without prior EPA guidance.  The court thus concluded that EPA must give States a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets before issuing FIPs.  The court also found the Agencys two-part interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision unreasonable, concluding that EPA must disregard costs and consider exclusively each upwind States physically proportionate responsibility for air quality problems downwind.
Held: 

        
        1.The CAA does not command that States be given a second opportunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified the States interstate pollution obligations.  Pp.1318.

        
        
        
        (a)The State respondents do not challenge EPAs disapproval of any particular SIP.  Instead, they argue that, notwithstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was still obliged to grant upwind States anadditional opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs after EPA had set the States emission budget.  This claim does not turn on the validity of the prior SIP disapprovals, but on whether the CAA requires EPA do more than disapprove a SIP to trigger the Agencys authority to issue a FIP.  Pp.1314.

        
        
        
        (b)The CAAs plain text supports the Agency: Disapproval of a SIP, without more, triggers EPAs obligation to issue a FIP.  The statute sets precise deadlines for the States and EPA.  Once EPA issues any new or revised NAAQS, a State shall propose a SIP within three years,

42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(1), and that SIP shall include, inter alia, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, 7410(a)(2).  If the EPA finds a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a statutory duty to issue a FIP at any time within two years.  7410(c)(1).  However sensible the D.C. Circuits exception to this strict time prescription may be, a reviewing courts task is to apply the text [of the statute], not to improve upon it.  Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp.,

493 U.S. 120
.  Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several other matters a State must address in its SIP.  Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on EPAs having first quantified an upwind States good neighbor obligations.  By altering Congress SIP and FIP schedule, the D.C. Circuit allowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an information submission obligation on EPA Congress did not impose.  Pp.1417.

        
        
        
        (c)The fact that EPA had previously accorded upwind States a chance to allocate emission budgets among their in-state sources does not show that the Agency acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so here.  EPA retained discretion to alter its course provided it gave a reasonable explanation for doing so.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,

463 U.S. 29
.  Here, the Agency had been admonished by the D.C. Circuit to act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR.  Endeavoring to satisfy that directive, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs and the Transport Rule contemporaneously.  Pp.1718.

        
        2.EPAs cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among upwind States is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision.  Pp.1831. 

        
        
        
        (a)Respondents attack on EPAs interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision is not foreclosed by 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides that [o]nly an objection to a rule ... raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment ... may be raised during judicial review.  Even assuming that respondents failed to object to the Transport Rule with reasonable specificity, that lapse is not jurisdictional.  Section 7607(d)(7)(B) is a mandatory, but notjurisdictional, rule, see Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,

546 U.S. 500
, which speaks to a partys procedural obligations, not a courts authority, see Kontrick v. Ryan,

540 U.S. 443
.  Because EPA did not press this argument unequivocally before the D.C. Circuit, it does not pose an impassable hindrance to this Courts review.  Pp.1819.

        
        
        
        (b)This Court routinely accords dispositive effect to an agencys reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language.

			The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health, 42 U.S.C. 7408.

EPA created an annual emissions budget for each upwind state and contemporaneously promulgated FIPs allocating each states budget among its pollution sources. The D.C.

The CAA does not require that states be given another opportunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified interstate pollution obligations. Disapproval of a SIP, without more, triggers EPAs obligation to issue a FIP within precise deadlines. That EPA had previously accorded upwind states a chance to allocate emission budgets among their sources does not show that it acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so in this instance.  The Good Neighbor Provision does not dictate a method of apportionment, so EPA had authority to select from among reasonable options; nothing precludes the final calculation from relying on costs. By imposing uniform cost thresholds on regulated states, the rule is efficient and is stricter on states that have done less pollution control in the past and does not amount to over-control.

OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 121184.Argued February 26, 2014Decided April 29, 2014
The Patent Acts fee-shifting provision authorizes district courts to award attorneys fees to prevailing parties in exceptional cases.

35 U.S.C. 285.  In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Intl, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an exceptional case as one which either involves material inappropriate conduct or is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.  Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the exceptional nature of a case by clear and convincing evidence.  Id., at 1382.

        
        
        
        Respondent ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Octane.  Octane then moved for attorneys fees under 285.  The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks Furniture framework, finding ICONs claim to be neither objectively baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.
Held:The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.  Pp.712.

        
        (a)Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district courts discretion to award attorneys fees: The power is reserved for exceptional cases.  Because the Patent Act does not define exceptional, the term is construed in accordance with [its] ordinary meaning.  Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. ___, ___.  In 1952, when Congress used the word in 285 (and today, for that matter), [e]xceptional meant uncommon, rare, or not ordinary.  Websters New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934).  An exceptional case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-spect to the substantive strength of a partys litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.  District courts may determine whether a case is exceptional in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.  Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,

510 U.S. 517
.  Pp.78.

        
        (b)The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.  Pp.811.

        
        
        
        (1)Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two categories of cases in which fee awards are allowed.  The first categorycases involving litigation or certain other misconductappears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct.  But that is not the appropriate benchmark.  A district court may award fees in the rare case in which a partys unreasonable, though not independently sanctionable, conduct is so exceptional as to justify an award.  For litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must determine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.  But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to be exceptional.  The Federal Circuit imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,

508 U.S. 49
, but that cases standard finds no roots in 285s text and makes little sense in the context of the exceptional-case determination.  Pp.810.

        
        
        
        (2)Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to render 285 largely superfluous.  Because courts already possess the inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,

421 U.S. 240
259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provisions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous.  See, e.g., Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC,

			The Patent Act authorizes district courts to award attorneys fees to prevailing parties in exceptional cases, 35 U.S.C. 285. In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit defined an exceptional case as one which either involves material inappropriate conduct or is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith as shown by clear and convincing evidence. ICON sued Octane for patent infringement. The district court granted summary judgment to Octane, but denied attorneys fees under section 285. The Federal Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, finding the Brooks Furniture framework unduly rigid  in light of the statutory grant of discretion to district courts. Section 285 imposes only one constraint on the award of attorneys fees, limiting it to exceptional cases. Because the Patent Act does not define exceptional, the term should be given it ordinary meaning: uncommon, rare, or not ordinary. An exceptional case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a partys litigating position (considering both governing law and the facts) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts may determine whether a case is exceptional in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances. The Brooks Furniture standard was so demanding that it appeared to render section 285 superfluous of the courts inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad faith. Section 285 imposes no specific evidentiary burden.

WHITE, WARDEN v. WOODALL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 12794.Argued December 11, 2013Decided April 23, 2014
Respondent pleaded guilty to capital murder, capital kidnaping, and first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the murder.  He was sentenced to death after the trial court denied defense counsels request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse inference from respondents decision not to testify at the penalty phase.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the
 
Fifth Amendments requirement of a no-adverse-inference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky,

450 U.S. 288
, is not required at the penalty phase.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief, holding that the trial courts refusal to give the requested instruction violated respondents privilege against self-incrimination.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Because the Kentucky Supreme Courts rejection of respondents
 
Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting the writ.  Pp.312.

        
        (a)The difficult-to-meet standard of

28 U.S.C. 2254(d) permits a court to grant federal habeas relief on a claim already adjudicated on the merits in State court only if that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court.

Nor was the Kentucky Supreme Courts conclusion an unreasonable application of the holdings in those cases.  This Court need not decide whether a no-adverse-inference instruction is required in these circumstances, for the issue before the Kentucky Supreme Court was, at a minimum, not beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement, Harrington, supra, at ___.  Mitchell in particular leaves open the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from a defendants penalty-phase silence.  Thus, it cannot be read to require the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested and denied here.  Moreover, because respondents own admissions of guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the burden of proof, Mitchells narrow holding, which implied that it was limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not apply.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
PAROLINE v. UNITED STATES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 128561.Argued January 22, 2014Decided April 23, 2014
The respondent victim in this case was sexually abused as a young girl in order to produce child pornography.  When she was 17, she learned that images of her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet, in effect repeating the original wrongs, for she knew that her humiliation and hurt would be renewed well into the future as thousands of additional wrongdoers witnessed those crimes.  Petitioner Paroline pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing images of child pornography, which included two of the victim, in violation of

18 U.S.C. 2252.  The victim then sought restitution under 2259, requesting nearly $3 million in lost income and about $500,000 in future treatment and counseling costs.  The District Court declined to award restitution, concluding that the Government had not met its burden of proving what losses, if any, were proximately caused by Parolines offense.  The victim sought a writ of mandamus, asking the Fifth Circuit to direct the District Court to order Paroline to pay restitution.  Granting the writ on rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit held, inter alia, that 2259 did not limit restitution to losses proximately caused by the defendant, and that each defendant who possessed the victims images should be made liable for the victims entire losses from the trade in her images. 
Held: 

        
        1.Restitution is proper under 2259 only to the extent the defendants offense proximately caused a victims losses.  This provision has a broad restitutionary purpose, stating that a district court shall order restitution for any offense under Chapter 110 of Title 18, such as Parolines possession offense; requiring district courts to order defendants to pay the victim ... the full amount of the victims losses as determined by the court, 2259(b)(1); and expressly making issuance of a restitution order ... mandatory, 2259(b)(4)(A).  The Government has the burden of demonstrating the amount of the [victims] loss.  3664(e).  

        
        To say one event proximately caused another means, first, that the former event caused the latter, i.e., actual cause or cause in fact; and second, that it is a proximate cause, i.e., it has a sufficient connection to the result.  The concept of proximate causation is applicable in both criminal and tort law, and the analysis is parallel in many instances.  Section 2259(c) defines a victim as the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter.  The words as a result of plainly suggest causation, and the referent of a crime is the offense of conviction.  The full amount of the victims losses, 2259(b)(1), includes any costs incurred by the victim for six enumerated categories of expense, 2259(b)(3).  The reference to costs incurred by the victim is most naturally understood as costs arising as a result of the offense of conviction, i.e., the defendants conduct.  And the last of the six enumerated categoriesfor other losses suffered ... as a proximate result of the offense, 2259(b)(3)(F)clearly states that the causal requirement is one of proximate cause.  This reading is supported by the canon of construction that, [w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.  Porto Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor,

253 U.S. 345
.  The reading also presents a commonsense way to impose sensible limitations on claims for attenuated costs.  Pp.511.

        
        2.Applying the statutes causation requirements in this case, victims should be compensated and defendants should be held to account for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but defendants should only be made liable for the consequences and gravity of their own conduct, not the conduct of others.  Pp.1125.  

        
        
        
        (a)A somewhat atypical causal process underlies the losses here.  It may be simple to prove aggregate losses, i.e., general losses, stemming from the ongoing traffic in the victims images, but the question for 2259 purposes is how much of these general losses were the proximate result of an individual defendants offense.  Here, the victims costs of treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma of knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over and over are direct and foreseeable results of child-pornography crimes, provided the prerequisite of factual causation is satisfied.  The primary problem, then, is the proper standard of causation in fact.  Pp.1112.

        
        
        
        (b)A showing of but-for causation is not the proper standard here, for it is not possible to prove that the victims losses would be less but for one possessors individual role in the large, loosely connected network through which her images circulate.  The victim and the Government urge the Court to read 2259 to require a less restrictive causation standard in child-pornography cases like this.  They endorse the theory of aggregate causation, one formulation of which finds factual causation satisfied where a wrongdoers conduct, though alone insufficient ... to cause the plaintiffs harm, is, when combined with conduct by other persons, more than sufficient to cause the harm.  1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physicaland Emotional Harm 27, Comment f.  Tort law teaches that such alternative causal tests, though a kind of legal fiction, may be necessary to vindicate the laws purposes, for it would be anomalous to turn away a person harmed by the combined acts of many wrongdoers simply because none of those wrongdoers alone caused the harm, and nonsensical to adopt a rule whereby individuals hurt by the combined wrongful acts of many would have no redress, while those hurt by the acts of one person alone would.  These are sound principles.  Taken too far, however, such alternative causal standards would treat each possessor as the cause in fact of all the trauma and attendant losses incurred as a result of all the ongoing traffic in the victims images.  Aggregate causation logic should not be adopted in an incautious manner in the context of criminal restitution, which differs from tort law in numerous respects.  Parolines contribution to the causal process underlying the victims losses was very minor, both compared to the combined acts of all other relevant offenders and compared to the contributions of other individual offenders, particularly distributors and the initial producer of the child pornography.  Congress gave no indication that it intended the statute to be applied in an expansive manner so starkly contrary to the principle that restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendants own conduct.  The victim claims that holding each possessor liable for her entire losses would be fair and practical in part because offenders can seek contribution from one another, but there is no general federal right to contribution and no specific statutory authorization for contribution here.  Her severe approach could also raise questions under the Excessive Fines Clause of the
 
Eighth Amendment.  Pp.1219.

        
        
        
        (c)While the victims expansive reading must be rejected, that does not mean the broader principles underlying aggregate causation theories are irrelevant to determining the proper outcome in cases like this.  The cause of the victims general losses is the trade in her images, and Paroline is a part of that cause.  Just as it undermines the purposes of tort law to turn away plaintiffs harmed by several wrongdoers, it would undermine 2259s purposes to turn away victims in cases like this.  With respect to the statutes remedial purpose, there is no question that it would produce anomalous results to say that no restitution is appropriate in these circumstances, for harms of the kind the victim endured here are a major reason why child pornography is outlawed.  The unlawful conduct of everyone who reproduces, distributes, or possesses images of the victims abuseincluding Parolineplays a part in sustaining and aggravating this tragedy.  And there is no doubt Congress wanted restitution for such victims.  Denying restitution would also be at odds with 2259s penological purposes, which include the need to impress upon offenders that their conduct produces concrete and devastating harms for real, identifiable victims.  Thus, where it can be shown both that a defendant possessed a victims images and that a victim has outstanding losses caused by the continuing traffic in her images but where it is impossible to trace a particular amount of those losses to the individual defendant utilizing a more traditional causal inquiry, a court should order restitution in an amount that comports with the defendants relative role in the causal process underlying the victims general losses.

        
        District courts should use discretion and sound judgment in determining the proper amount of restitution.  A variety of factors may serve as guideposts.  Courts might, as a start, determine the amount of the victims losses caused by the continuing traffic in the victims images, and then base an award on factors bearing on the relative causal significance of the defendants conduct in producing those losses.  The victim finds this approach untenable because her losses are indivisible, but the Court is required to define a causal standard that effects the statutes purposes, not to apply tort-law concepts in a mechanical way in the criminal restitution context.  She also argues she will be consigned to piecemeal restitution that may never lead to full recovery, but Congress has not promised victims full and swift restitution at the cost of holding a defendant liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to his individual causal relation to those losses.  Furthermore, this approach better effects the need to impress upon defendants that their acts are not irrelevant or victimless.  Pp.1925.

        
        
        
        (d)Though this approach is not without difficulties, courts can only do their best to apply the statute as written in a workable manner, faithful to the competing principles at stake: that victims should be compensated and that defendants should be held to account for the impact of their own conduct, not the conduct of others.  District courts, which routinely exercise wide discretion both in sentencing generally and in fashioning restitution orders, should be able to apply the causal standard defined here without further detailed guidance.  P.25.

District courts, which routinely exercise wide discretion both in sentencing generally and in fashioning restitution orders, should be able to apply the causal standard defined here without further detailed guidance.  P.25.

        Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Roberts, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion."|"
			The victim was sexually abused as a young girl during production of child pornography. When she was 17, she learned that images of her abuse were being trafficked on the Internet. Paroline pleaded guilty to possessing images of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. 2252, including two of the victim, who sought restitution under section 2259--about $3 million in lost income and $500,000 for future treatment and counseling. The district court declined to award restitution, citing failure to prove proximate cause. The Fifth Circuit held that each defendant who possessed the victims images should be held liable for the victims entire losses. The Supreme Court reversed. Section 2259 restitution is proper only to the extent the defendants offense proximately caused a victims losses. The prosecution has the burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss and proximate cause. Victims should be compensated and defendants should be held liable for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but not for the conduct of others. In this case, it is simple to prove aggregate losses: the victims costs of treatment and lost income resulting from the trauma of knowing that images of her abuse are being viewed over and over are direct and foreseeable results of child-pornography crimes. It is not possible, however, to prove that the victims losses would be less but for one possessors individual role in the large, loosely connected network through which her images circulate. While it would be anomalous to deny redress to a person harmed by the combined acts of many wrongdoers simply because no wrongdoer alone caused the harm, aggregate causation logic should not be adopted incautiously for criminal restitution. The victims proposed theory would pose problems because there is no general federal right to contribution and no specific statutory authorization in this case; her approach could also raise questions under the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause.  A court should order restitution that comports with the defendants relative role in the causal process underlying the victims general losses. A variety of factors may serve as guideposts in arriving at the relative causal significance of the defendants conduct.  Congress has not promised victims full and swift restitution at the cost of holding a defendant liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to his individual causal relation to those losses.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
SCHUETTE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHIGAN v. COALITION TO DEFEND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, INTEGRATION AND IMMIGRATION RIGHTS AND FIGHT FOR EQUALITY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY (BAMN) etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 12682.Argued October 15, 2013
        
        Decided April 22, 2014
After this Court decided that the University of Michigans undergraduate admissions plans use of race-based preferences violated the Equal Protection Clause, Gratz v. Bollinger,

539 U.S. 244
, but that the law school admission plans more limited use did not, Grutter v. Bollinger,

539 U.S. 306
, Michigan voters adopted Proposal 2, now Art.I, 26, of the State Constitution, which, as relevant here, prohibits the use of race-based preferences as part of the admissions process for state universities.  In consolidated challenges, the District Court granted summary judgment to Michigan, thus upholding Proposal 2, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the proposal violated the principles of Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,

458 U.S. 457
. 
Held:The judgment is reversed.
701 F.3d 466, reversed.

        
        Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Courts precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.  Pp.418.

        
        (a)This case is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education.  Here, the principle that the consideration of race in admissions is permissible when certain conditions are met is not being challenged.  Rather, the question concerns whether, and in what manner, voters in the States may choose to prohibit the consideration of such racial preferences.  Where States have prohibited race-conscious admissions policies, universities have responded by experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.  Grutter, supra, at 342.  The decision by Michigan voters reflects the ongoing national dialogue about such practices.  Pp.45.

        
        (b)The Sixth Circuits determination that Seattle controlled here extends Seattles holding in a case presenting quite different issues to reach a mistaken conclusion.  Pp.518.

        
        
        
        (1)It is necessary to consider first the relevant cases preceding Seattle and the background against which Seattle arose.  Both Reitman v. Mulkey,

387 U.S. 369
, and Hunter v. Erickson,

393 U.S. 385
, involved demonstrated injuries on the basis of race that, by reasons of state encouragement or participation, became more aggravated.  In Mulkey, a voter-enacted amendment to the California Constitution prohibiting state legislative interference with an owners prerogative to decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis barred the challenging parties, on account of race, from invoking the protection of Californias statutes, thus preventing them from leasing residential property.  In Hunter, voters overturned an Akron ordinance that was enacted to address widespread racial discrimination in housing sales and rentals had forced many to live in unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded segregated housing, 393 U.S., at 391.  In Seattle, after the school board adopted a mandatory busing program to alleviate racial isolation of minority students in local schools, voters passed a state initiative that barred busing to desegregate.  This Court found that the state initiative had the practical effect of removing the authority to address a racial problem ... from the existing decisionmaking body, in such a way as to burden minority interests of busing advocates who must now seek relief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate.  458 U.S., at 474.  Pp.58.

        
        
        
        (2)Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state action had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account of race as had been the case in Mulkey and Hunter.  While there had been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect to Seattles school district, a finding that would be required today, see Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,

551 U.S. 701
721, Seattle must be understood as Seattle understood itself, as a case in which neither the State nor the United States challenge[d] the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a finding of prior dejure segregation.  458 U.S. at 472, n.15.

        
        Seattles broad language, however, went well beyond the analysis needed to resolve the case.  Seizing upon the statement in Justice Harlans concurrence in Hunter that the procedural change in that case had the clear purpose of making it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest, 385 U.S., at 395, the Seattle Court established a new and far-reaching rationale: Where a government policy inures primarily to the benefit of the minority and minorities ... consider the policy to be in their interest, then any state action that place[s] effective decisionmaking authority over that policy at a different level of government is subject to strict scrutiny.  458 U.S., at 472, 474.  Pp.811.

        
        
        
        (3)To the extent Seattle is read to require the Court to determine and declare which political policies serve the interest of a group defined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision in Seattle; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious equal protection concerns.  In cautioning against impermissible racial stereotypes, this Court has rejected the assumption that all individuals of the same race think alike, see Shaw v. Reno,

509 U.S. 630
, but that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the Seattle formulation to control.  And if it were deemed necessary to probe how some races define their own interest in political matters, still another beginning point would be to define individuals according to race.  Such a venture would be undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision.  It would also result in, or impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable constitutionality on their own terms.  Assuming these steps could be taken, the court would next be required to determine the policy realms in which groups defined by race had a political interest.  That undertaking, again without guidance from accepted legal standards, would risk the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose certain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage.  Adoption of the Seattle formulation could affect any number of laws or decisions, involving, e.g., tax policy or housing subsidies.  And racial division would be validated, not discouraged.  

        
        It can be argued that objections to the larger consequences of the Seattle formulation need not be confronted here, for race was an undoubted subject of the ballot issue.  But other problems raised by Seattle, such as racial definitions, still apply.  And the principal flaw in the Sixth Circuits decision remains: Here there was no infliction of a specific injury of the kind at issue in Mulkey and Hunter and in the history of the Seattle schools, and there is no precedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that race-based preferences granted by state entities should be ended.  The Sixth Circuits judgment also calls into question other States long-settled rulings on policies similar to Michigans. 

        
        Unlike the injuries in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle, the question here is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based preferences should be continued.  By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding 26 to their State Constitution, Michigan voters exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power, bypassing public officials they deemed not responsive to their concerns about a policy of granting race-based preferences.  The mandate for segregated schools, Brown v. Board of Education,

347 U.S. 483
, and scores of other examples teach that individual liberty has constitutional protection.  But this Nations constitutional system also embraces the right of citizens to speak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral process, as Michigan voters have done here.  These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or command of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress by the courts.  Such circumstances were present in Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle, but they are not present here.  Pp.1118.

        
        Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that 26 rightly stands, though not because it passes muster under the political-process doctrine.  It likely does not, but the cases establishing that doctrine should be overruled.  They are patently atextual, unadministrable, and contrary to this Courts traditional equal protection jurisprudence.  The question here, as in every case in which neutral state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory purpose.  It plainly does not.  Pp.118.

        
        (a)The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held 26 unconstitutional under the so-called political-process doctrine, derived from Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,

458 U.S. 457
, and Hunter v. Erickson,

393 U.S. 385
.  In those cases, one level of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently racial issue until a higher level of government called the loan.  This Court deemed each revocation an equal-protection violation, without regard to whether there was evidence of an invidious purpose to discriminate.  The relentless, radical logic of Hunter and Seattle would point to a similar conclusion here, as in so many other cases.  Pp.37.

        
        (b)The problems with the political-process doctrine begin with its triggering prong, which assigns to a court the task of determining whether a law that reallocates policymaking authority concerns a racial issue, Seattle, 458 U.S., at 473, i.e., whether adopting one position on the question would at bottom inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose, id., at 472.  Such freeform judicial musing into ethnic and racial interests involves judges in the dirty business of dividing the Nation into racial blocs, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC,

497 U.S. 547
 (OConnor, J., dissenting), and promotes racial stereotyping, see Shaw v. Reno,

509 U.S. 630
.  More fundamentally, the analysis misreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect particular groups, a construction that has been repudiated in a long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea,

515 U.S. 200
.  Pp.712.

        
        (c)The second part of the Hunter-Seattle analysis directs a court to determine whether the challenged act place[s] effective decisionmaking authority over [the] racial issue at a different level of government, Seattle, supra, at 474; but, in another line of cases, the Court has emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design its governing structure as it sees fit, see, e.g., Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa,

439 U.S. 60
.  Taken to the limits of its logic, Hunter-Seattle is the gaping exception that nearly swallows the rule of structural state sovereignty, which would seem to permit a State to give certain powers to cities, later assign the same powers to counties, and even reclaim them for itself.  Pp.1215.

        
        (d)Hunter and Seattle also endorse a version of the proposition that a facially neutral law may deny equal protection solely because it has a disparate racial impact.  That equal-protection theory has been squarely and soundly rejected by an unwavering line of cases holding that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires state action motivated by discriminatory intent, Hernandez v. New York,

500 U.S. 352
373 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment), and that official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact, Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,

429 U.S. 252
265.  Respondents cannot prove that the action here reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, for any law expressly requiring state actors to afford all persons equal protection of the laws does notcannotdeny to any person ... equal protection of the laws, U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1.  Pp.1517.

        
        Justice Breyer agreed that the amendment is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, but for different reasons.  First, this case addresses the amendment only as it applies to, and forbids, race-conscious admissions programs that consider race solely in order to obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  Second, the Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of the kind of race-conscious programs now barred by the Michigan Constitution.  It foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument for resolving debates about the merits of these programs.  Third, Hunter v. Erickson,

393 U.S. 385
, and Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,

458 U.S. 457
, which reflect the important principle that an individuals ability to participate meaningfully in the political process should be independent of his race, do not apply here.  Those cases involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters.  Hence, this case does not involve a diminution of the minoritys ability to participate in the political process.  Extending the holding of Hunter and Seattle to situations where decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative body to a political one would also create significant difficulties, given the nature of the administrative process.  Furthermore, the principle underlying Hunter and Seattle runs up against a competing principle favoring decisionmaking through the democratic process.  Pp.16.

        
        Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Alito, J., joined.  Roberts, C.J., filed a concurring opinion.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Thomas, J., joined.  Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.  Kagan, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Second, the Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of the kind of race-conscious programs now barred by the Michigan Constitution.  It foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument for resolving debates about the merits of these programs.  Third, Hunter v. Erickson,

393 U.S. 385
, and Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,

458 U.S. 457
, which reflect the important principle that an individuals ability to participate meaningfully in the political process should be independent of his race, do not apply here.  Those cases involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters.  Hence, this case does not involve a diminution of the minoritys ability to participate in the political process.  Extending the holding of Hunter and Seattle to situations where decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative body to a political one would also create significant difficulties, given the nature of the administrative process.  Furthermore, the principle underlying Hunter and Seattle runs up against a competing principle favoring decisionmaking through the democratic process.  Pp.16.

			After the Supreme Court decided that the University of Michigans undergraduate admissions plans use of race-based preferences violated the Equal Protection Clause, but that its law school admission plans limited use did not, Michigan voters adopted a new section of the state constitution (Proposal 2), prohibiting use of race-based preferences in the admissions process for state universities. The district court upheld Proposal 2, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that it violated Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court reversed.  Justice Kennedy, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, reasoned that the principle that consideration of race in admissions is permissible when certain conditions are met was not challenged; the issue was whether, and how, state voters may choose to prohibit consideration of such racial preferences. The decision by Michigan voters reflects an ongoing national dialogue; there was no infliction of a specific injury of the type at issue in cases cited by the Sixth Circuit. Individual liberty has constitutional protection, but the Constitution also embraces the right of citizens to act through a lawful electoral process, as Michigan voters did.  Justices Scalia and Thomas stated that the question here, as in every case in which neutral state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory purpose. Stating that it did not, the Justices stated that the proposition that a facially neutral law may deny equal protection solely because it has a disparate racial impact has been squarely and soundly rejected. Justice Breyer agreed that the amendment is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, but reasoned that the amendment only applies to, and forbids, race-conscious admissions programs that consider race solely in order to obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body; the Constitution permits, but does not require, the use of that kind of race-conscious program. The ballot box, not the courts, is the instrument for resolving debates about such programs. This case does not involve a diminution of the minoritys ability to participate in the political process.

PRADO NAVARETTE etal. v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district
No. 129490.Argued January 21, 2014Decided April 22, 2014
A California Highway Patrol officer stopped the pickup truck occupied by petitioners because it matched the description of a vehicle that a 911 caller had recently reported as having run her off the road.  As he and a second officer approached the truck, they smelled marijuana.  They searched the trucks bed, found 30 pounds of marijuana, and arrested petitioners.  Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the traffic stop violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Their motion was denied, and they pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding that the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.
Held:The traffic stop complied with the
 
Fourth Amendment because, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had reasonable suspicion that the trucks driver was intoxicated.  Pp.311.

        
        (a)The
 
Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative stops when an officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of ... criminal activity.  United States v. Cortez,

449 U.S. 411
418.  Reasonable suspicion takes into account the totality of the circumstances, id., at 417, and depends upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability, Alabama v. White,

496 U.S. 325
.  An anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates sufficient reliability, White, 496 U.S., at 329, but may do so under appropriate circumstances, id., at 327.  Pp.35.

        
        (b)The 911 call in this case bore adequate indicia of reliability for the officer to credit the callers account.  By reporting that she had been run off the road by a specific vehicle, the caller necessarily claimed an eyewitness basis of knowledge.  The apparently short time between the reported incident and the 911 call suggests that the caller had little time to fabricate the report.  And a reasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using the 911 system, which has several technological and regulatory features that safeguard against making false reports with immunity.  Pp.58.

        
        (c)Not only was the tip here reliable, but it also created reasonable suspicion of drunk driving.  Running another car off the road suggests the sort of impairment that characterizes drunk driving.  While that conduct might be explained by another cause such as driver distraction, reasonable suspicion need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.  United States v. Arvizu,

534 U.S. 266
.  Finally, the officers failure to observe additional suspicious conduct during the short period that he followed the truck did not dispel the reasonable suspicion of drunk driving, and the officer was not required to surveil the truck for a longer period.  Pp.810.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
NORTHWEST, INC., etal. v. GINSBERG
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 12462.Argued December 3, 2013Decided April 2, 2014
Petitioner Northwest, Inc., terminated respondents membership in its frequent flyer program, apparently based on a provision in the frequent flyer agreement that gave Northwest sole discretion to determine whether a participant had abused the program.  Respondent filed suit, asserting, as relevant here, that Northwest had breached its contract by revoking his membership status without valid cause and had violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable expectations.  The District Court found that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim and dismissed the breach of contract claim without prejudice.  Respondent appealed only the dismissal of his breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that claim too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger ADA pre-emption.  
Held:

        
        1.The ADA pre-empts a state-law claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge the contractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopt.  Pp.410.

        
        
        
        (a)Before the ADA was enacted, air carriers routes, rates, and services were regulated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.  And because that Act contained a saving provision preserving pre-existing statutory and common-law remedies, air carriers were also regulated by the States.  The ADA did not repeal that saving provision, but it did include a pre-emption provision to prohibit States from enact[ing] or enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to [an air carriers] price, route, or service,

49 U.S.C. 41713(b)(1), thus ensuring that States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own, Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,

504 U.S. 374
.  In Morales, the Court recognized that the key phrase related to expresses a broad pre-emptive purpose, id., at 383, and held that the ADA pre-empted the use of state consumer protection laws to regulate airline advertising, concluding that relat[es] to means ha[s] a connection with, or reference to, airline rates, routes, or services, id., at 384.  And in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens,

513 U.S. 219
, the Court found that the ADA pre-empted the use of an Illinois consumer law to challenge an airlines devaluation of frequent flyer earned miles.  But it did not pre-empt breach of contract claims because terms and conditions airlines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations not a States enact[ment] or enforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law within the [pre-emption provisions] meaning.  Id., at 228229.  Pp.46.

        
        
        
        (b)The phrase other provision having the force and effect of law includes state common-law rules like the implied covenant at issue.  Common-law rules are routinely called provisions, see, e.g., Madsen v. Womens Health Center, Inc.,

512 U.S. 753
, n.3, and they clearly have the force and effect of law.  The pre-emption provisions original language confirms this understanding.  As first enacted, the provision also applied to rule[s] and standard[s], a formulation encompassing common-law rules.  See CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood,

507 U.S. 658
.  And Congress made clear that the deletion of those terms as part of Title 49s wholesale recodification effected no substantive change.  1(a),

108Stat.
745.

        
        Respondents reliance on Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,

537 U.S. 51
, is misplaced.  There, the Court held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but that Acts pre-emption provision is more narrowly worded than the ADA provision.  The Boat Safety Acts saving and pre-emption provisions were also enacted at the same time, while the Federal Aviation Acts general remedies saving clause is a relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption regime, Morales, 504 U.S., at 385, that cannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision, ibid.

        
        Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the ADAs central purpose, which was to eliminate federal regulation of rates, routes, and services so they could be set by market forces.  Finally, if all state common-law rules fell outside the pre-emption provisions ambit, Wolens would not have singled out a subcategory, for common-law claims based on the parties voluntary undertaking, as falling outside that provisions coverage.  Pp.69.

        
        
        
        (c)Respondents claim relates to rates, routes, or services.  It clearly has a connection with or reference to airline prices, routes, or services, Morales, 504 U.S., at 384.  As in Wolens, Northwests program connects to the airlines rates by awarding mileage credits redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing ticket prices.  It also connects to services, i.e., access to flights and higher service categories.  Respondents counterarguments are unpersuasive.  His claim that he is contesting his termination, not access to flights or upgrades, ignores his reason for seeking reinstatement: to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services.  Although respondent and amici claim there have been fundamental changes in the way that frequent flyer miles are earned since Wolens was decided, that does not matter here where respondent did not assert that he earned miles from any activity but taking flights or that he attempted to redeem miles for anything but tickets and upgrades.  Pp.910.

        
        2.Because respondents implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge his contractual agreement with petitioners, it is pre-empted by 41713(b)(1).  Under Minnesota law, which controls here, the implied covenant must be regarded as a state-imposed obligation.  Minnesota law does not permit parties to contract out of the covenant.  And when a States law does not authorize parties to free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under Wolens.  As an independent basis for this conclusion, if, as Minnesota law provides, the implied covenant applies to every contract except employment contracts  for policy reasons, then the decision not to exempt other types of contracts must likewise be based on a policy determination, namely, that the policy reason for the employment contract rule does not apply in other contexts.  

        
        Petitioners claim that the refusal to pre-empt all implied covenant claims, regardless of state law, will lead to a patchwork of rules that will frustrate the ADAs deregulatory aim.  But airlines can avoid such a result if they contract out of covenants where permitted by state law.  Nor are participants in frequent flyer programs left without protection.  They can avoid an airline with a poor reputation and possibly enroll in a more favorable rival program.  Moreover, the Department of Transportation has the authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs.  Finally, respondent might have been able to vindicate his claim of ill treatment by Northwest had he appealed his breach of contract claim.  Pp.1014.
695 F. 3d 873, reversed and remanded.

        
        Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

			Northwest terminated plaintiffs membership in its frequent flyer program. A provision in the frequent flyer agreement gave Northwest sole discretion to determine whether a participant had abused the program. Plaintiff claimed that Northwest breached its contract by revoking his membership without valid cause and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable expectations. The district court dismissed, holding that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that claim too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger ADA pre-emption.  A unanimous Supreme Court reversed. The Act pre-empts a state-law claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge contractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopted.  The Act prohibits states from enact[ing] or enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to [an air carriers] price, route, or service, 49 U.S.C. 41713(b)(1).  The phrase other provision having the force and effect of law includes state common-law rules like the claimed implied covenant. Exempting common-law claims would disserve the Acts central purpose: to eliminate federal regulation of rates, routes, and services so they could be set by market forces. Northwests program connects to rates by awarding credits redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing ticket prices. It also connects to services, i.e., access to flights and higher service categories.  Because the implied covenant claim sought to enlarge contractual agreement, it is pre-empted. Under controlling Minnesota law, parties may not contract out of the implied covenant; when state law does not authorize parties to free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted. Participants in frequent flyer programs can protect themselves by avoiding airlines with poor reputations and enrolling in more favorable rival programs; the Department of Transportation has authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs. The Court also noted that the plaintiff did not appeal his breach of contract claim.

				The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions.  Base limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee while aggregate limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees.  

2 U.S.C. 441a.
			

				
				
				
				
				In the 20112012 election cycle, appellant McCutcheon contributed to 16 different federal candidates, complying with the base limits applicable to each.  He alleges that the aggregate limits prevented him from contributing to 12 additional candidates and to a number of noncandidate political committees.  He also alleges that he wishes to make similar contributions in the future, all within the base limits.  McCutcheon and appellant Republican National Committee filed a complaint before a three-judge District Court, asserting that the aggregate limits were unconstitutional under the 
 
First Amendment.  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the Governments motion to dismiss.  Assuming that the base limits appropriately served the Governments anticorruption interest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate limits survived 
 
First Amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.  
			

				Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
			

				893 F.Supp. 2d 133, reversed and remanded.
			

				
				
				Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded that the aggregate limits are invalid under the 
 
First Amendment.  Pp.740.
			

				
				
				(a)Appellants substantial 
 
First Amendment challenge to the current system of aggregate limits merits plenary consideration.  Pp.714.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)In Buckley, this Court evaluated the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits in FECA.  Buckley distinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected 
 
First Amendment interests.  It subjected expenditure limits to the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core 
 
First Amendment rights of political expression.  424 U.S., at 4445.  But it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still rigorous standard of review, id., at 29, under which such limits may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms, id., at 25.  Because the Court found that the primary purpose of FECApreventing quid pro quo corruption and its appearancewas a sufficiently important governmental interest, id., at 2627, it upheld the base limit under the closely drawn test, id., at 29.  After doing so, the Court devoted only one paragraph of its 139-page opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under FECA, noting that the provision ha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties.  Id., at 38.  It concluded that the aggregate limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was no more than a corollary of that limit.  Id., at 38.  Pp.79.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)There is no need in this case to revisit Buckleys distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corresponding distinction in standards of review.  Regardless whether strict scrutiny or the closely drawn test applies, the analysis turns on the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.  Here, given the substantial mismatch between the Governments stated objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the closely drawn test.  
			

				
				
				Buckleys ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control here.  Buckley spent just three sentences analyzing that limit, which had not been separately addressed by the parties.  Appellants here, by contrast, have directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under BCRA, a different statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct legal backdrop.  Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since Buckley.  The 1976 FECA Amendments added another layer of base limitscapping contributions from individuals to political committeesand an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.  Since Buckley, the Federal Election Commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme that further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits through unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to a particular candidate.  424 U.S., at 38.  In addition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes, appellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in Buckley, including an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit.  Pp.1014.
			

				
				
				(b)Significant 
 
First Amendment interests are implicated here.  Contributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individuals right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.  A restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a modest restraint on those rights.  The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.  In its simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits.  And it is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less than the base limits permit: To require one person to contribute at lower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to penalize that individual for robustly exercis[ing] his 
 
First Amendment rights.  Davis v. Federal Election Commn, 

554 U.S. 724
. 
			

				
				
				In assessing the 
 
First Amendment interests at stake, the proper focus is on an individuals right to engage in political speech, not a collective conception of the public good.  The whole point of the 
 
First Amendment is to protect individual speech that the majority might prefer to restrict, or that legislators or judges might not view as useful to the democratic process.  Pp.1418.
			

				
				
				(c)The aggregate limits do not further the permissible governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.  Pp.1836.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.  See Davis, supra, at 741.  Moreover, the only type of corruption that Congress may target is quid pro quo corruption.  Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholders official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corruption.  Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner influence over or access to elected officials or political parties.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 

558 U.S. 310
.  The line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence must be respected in order to safeguard basic 
 
First Amendment rights, and the Court must err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.  Federal Election Commn v. Wisconsin Right to Life, 

551 U.S. 449
 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  Pp.1821.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)The Government argues that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.  The difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contributions of any amount, even though Congresss selection of a base limit indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not create a cognizable risk of corruption.  The Government must thus defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits, a function they do not serve in any meaningful way.  Given the statutes and regulations currently in effect, Buckleys fear that an individual might contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through ... unearmarked contributions to entities likely to support the candidate, 424 U.S., at 38, is far too speculative.  Even accepting Buckleys circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive massive amounts of money that could be traced back to a particular donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.  The Governments scenarios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or implausible.  Pp.2130.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)The aggregate limits also violate the 
 
First Amendment because they are not closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.  Buckley, supra, at 25.  The Government argues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation, but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are retained and spent by their recipients.  And the Government has provided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.  The indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is thus disproportionate to the Governments interest in preventing circumvention. 
			

				
				
				Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress that would serve the Governments interest in preventing circumvention while avoiding unnecessary abridgment of 
 
First Amendment rights.  Buckley, supra, at 25.  Such alternatives might include targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees, or tighter earmarking rules.  Transfers, after all, are the key to the Governments concern about circumvention, but they can be addressed without such a direct and broad interference with 
 
First Amendment rights.  Pp.3035.
			

				
				
				
				
				(4)Disclosure of contributions also reduces the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system.  Disclosure requirements, which are justified by a governmental interest in provid[ing] the electorate with information about the sources of election-related spending, Citizens United, supra, at 367, may deter corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity, Buckley, supra at 67.  Disclosure requirements may burden speech, but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.  Particularly with modern technology, disclosure now offers more robust protections against corruption than it did when Buckley was decided.  Pp.3536.
			

				
				
				(d)The Government offers an additional rationale for the aggregate limits, arguing that the opportunity for corruption exists whenever a legislator is given a large check, even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be divided among numerous candidates or committees.  That rationale dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior cases.  Buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that massive amounts of money could be funneled to a particular candidate in excess of the base limits.  424 U.S., at 38.  Recasting as corruption a donors widely distributed support for a political party would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.  And though the Government suggests that solicitation of large contributions poses the corruption danger, the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.  Pp.3639.
			

				
				
				Justice Thomas agreed that the aggregate limits are invalid under the 
 
First Amendment, but would overrule Buckley v. Valeo, 

424 U.S. 1
, and subject BCRAs aggregate limits to strict scrutiny, which they would surely fail.  Buckleys analytic foundation ... was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the intervening years.  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 

528 U.S. 377
 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Contributions and expenditures are simply two sides of the same 
 
First Amendment coin, and this Courts efforts to distinguish the two have produced mere word games rather than any cognizable constitutional law principle.  Buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (Burger, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Pp.15.

Syllabus
UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 121371.Argued January 15, 2014Decided March 26, 2014
Respondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under

18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  He argued that his previous conviction for intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to the mother of his child, App. 27, did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it did not involve the use or attempted use of physical force,

18 U.S.C. 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  The District Court agreed, reasoning that physical force must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on a different rationale.  It held that the degree of physical force required for a conviction to constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is the same as that required for a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 924(e)(2)(B)(i)namely, violent forceand that Castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.  
Held:Castlemans conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  Pp.416.

        
        (a)Section 922(g)(9)s physical force requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery convictionnamely, offensive touching.  Congress presumably intends to incorporate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing suggests Congress intended otherwise here.  The Sixth Circuit relied upon Johnson v. United States,

559 U.S. 133
, in which the common-law meaning of force was found to be a comical misfit, id., at 145, when read into ACCAs violent felony definition.  But Johnson resolves this case in the Governments favor: The very reasons for rejecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace it here.  First, whereas it was unlikely that Congress meant to incorporate in ACCAs violent felony definition a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor, id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate the misdemeanor-specific meaning of force in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  Second, whereas the word violent or violence standing alone connotes a substantial degree of force, id., at 140, that is not true of domestic violence, which is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as violent in a nondomestic context.  Third, whereas this Court has hesitated to apply ACCA to crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels armed career criminals, Begay v. United States,

553 U.S. 137
, there is no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with others whom 922(g) disqualifies from gun ownership.  In addition, a contrary reading would have made 922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.  Pp.410.

        
        (b)Under this definition of physical force, Castlemans conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  The application of the modified categorical approachconsulting Castlemans state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offenseis straightforward.  Castleman pleaded guilty to intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to the mother of his child, and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.  First, a bodily injury must result from physical force.  The common-law concept of force encompasses even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense.  Second, the knowing or intentional application of force is a use of force.  Leocal v. Ashcroft,

543 U.S. 1
, distinguished.  Pp.1013.

        
        (c)Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Courts interpretation of 922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.1415.  
695 F.3d 582, reversed and remanded.

UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 121371.Argued January 15, 2014Decided March 26, 2014
Respondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under

18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  He argued that his previous conviction for intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to the mother of his child, App. 27, did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it did not involve the use or attempted use of physical force,

18 U.S.C. 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  The District Court agreed, reasoning that physical force must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on a different rationale.  It held that the degree of physical force required for a conviction to constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is the same as that required for a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 924(e)(2)(B)(i)namely, violent forceand that Castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.  
Held:Castlemans conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  Pp.416.

        
        (a)Section 922(g)(9)s physical force requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery convictionnamely, offensive touching.  Congress presumably intends to incorporate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing suggests Congress intended otherwise here.  The Sixth Circuit relied upon Johnson v. United States,

559 U.S. 133
, in which the common-law meaning of force was found to be a comical misfit, id., at 145, when read into ACCAs violent felony definition.  But Johnson resolves this case in the Governments favor: The very reasons for rejecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace it here.  First, whereas it was unlikely that Congress meant to incorporate in ACCAs violent felony definition a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor, id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate the misdemeanor-specific meaning of force in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  Second, whereas the word violent or violence standing alone connotes a substantial degree of force, id., at 140, that is not true of domestic violence, which is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as violent in a nondomestic context.  Third, whereas this Court has hesitated to apply ACCA to crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels armed career criminals, Begay v. United States,

553 U.S. 137
, there is no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with others whom 922(g) disqualifies from gun ownership.  In addition, a contrary reading would have made 922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.  Pp.410.

        
        (b)Under this definition of physical force, Castlemans conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  The application of the modified categorical approachconsulting Castlemans state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offenseis straightforward.  Castleman pleaded guilty to intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to the mother of his child, and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.  First, a bodily injury must result from physical force.  The common-law concept of force encompasses even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense.  Second, the knowing or intentional application of force is a use of force.  Leocal v. Ashcroft,

543 U.S. 1
, distinguished.  Pp.1013.

        
        (c)Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Courts interpretation of 922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.1415.  
695 F.3d 582, reversed and remanded.

        
        Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Thomas, J., joined."|"
			Castleman was indicted under 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9), for possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. He argued that his Tennessee conviction for intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to the mother of his child did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it did not involve use or attempted use of physical force. The district court dismissed, reasoning that physical force must entail violent contact and that bodily injury can be caused without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on different reasoning: that the degree of physical force required for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is the same as that required for a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, violent force, and that Castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that section 922(g)(9)s physical force requirement is satisfied by the offensive touching degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction. Congress presumably intends to incorporate the common-law meaning of terms and nothing suggests a different intention here. While the word violent or violence standing alone connotes a substantial degree of force, domestic violence, is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as violent in a nondomestic context. There is no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses with others disqualified by section 922(g) from gun ownership. Application of the modified categorical approachconsulting the indictment to determine whether Castlemans conviction entailed the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offenseis straightforward. The knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involved use of physical force. The common-law concept of force encompasses even its indirect application; the knowing or intentional application of force is a use of force.

UNITED STATES v. QUALITY STORES, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 121408.Argued January 14, 2014Decided March 25, 2014
Respondent Quality Stores, Inc., and its affiliates (collectively Quality Stores) made severance payments to employees who were involuntarily terminated as part of Quality Stores Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Paymentswhich were made pursuant to plans that did not tie payments to the receipt of state unemployment insurancevaried based on job seniority and time served.  Quality Stores paid and withheld, inter alia, taxes required under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA),

26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.  Later believing that the payments should not have been taxed as wages under FICA, Quality Stores sought a refund on behalf of itself and about 1,850 former employees.  When the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not allow or deny the refund, Quality Stores initiated proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court, which granted summary judgment in its favor.  The District Court and Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that severance payments are not wages under FICA.
Held:The severance payments at issue are taxable wages for FICA purposes.  Pp.415.

        
        (a)FICA defines wages broadly as all remuneration for employment.  3121(a).  As a matter of plain meaning, severance payments fit this definition: They are a form of remuneration made only to employees in consideration for employment.  Employment is any service ... performed ... by an employee for an employer.  3121(b).  By varying according to a terminated employees function and seniority, the severance payments at issue confirm the principle that service mea[ns] not only work actually done but the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid.  Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko,

327 U.S. 358
366.  This broad definition is reinforced by the specificity of FICAs lengthy list of exemptions.  The exemption for severance payments made because of ... retirement for disability, 3121(a)(13)(A), would be unnecessary were severance payments generally not considered wages.  FICAs statutory history sheds further light on the definition.  FICA originally contained definitions of wages and employment identical in substance to the current ones, but in 1939, Congress excepted from wages [d]ismissal payments not legally required by the employer,

53Stat.
1384.  Since that exception was repealed in 1950, FICA has contained no general exception for severance payments.  Pp.47.

        
        (b)The Internal Revenue Code chapter governing income-tax withholding does not limit the meaning of wages for FICA purposes.  Like FICAs definitional section, 3401(a) has a broad definition of wages and contains a series of specific exemptions.  Section 3402(o) instructs that supplemental unemployment compensation benefits or SUBs, which include severance payments, be treated as if they were wages.  Contrary to Quality Stores reading, this as if instruction does not mean that severance payments fall outside the definition of wages for income-tax withholding purposes and, in turn, are not covered by FICAs definition.  Nor can Quality Stores rely on 3402(o)s heading, which refers to certain payments other than wages.  To the extent statutory headings are useful in resolving ambiguity, see FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,

359 U.S. 385
389, 3402(o)s heading falls short of declaring that all the payments listed in 3402(o) are other than wages.  Instead, 3402(o) must be understood in terms of the regulatory background against which it was enacted.  In the 1950s and 1960s, because some States provided unemployment benefits only to terminated employees not earning wages, IRS Rulings took the position that severance payments tied to the receipt of state benefits were not wages.  To address the problem that severance payments were still considered taxable income, which could lead to large year-end tax liability for terminated workers, Congress enacted 3402(o), which treats both SUBs and severance payments the IRS considered wages as if they were wages subject to withholding.  By extending this treatment to all SUBs, Congress avoided the practical problems that might arise if the IRS later determined that SUBs besides severance payments linked to state benefits should be exempt from withholding.  Considering this regulatory background, the assumption that Congress meant to exclude all SUBs from the definition of wages is unsustainable.  That 3402(o) does not narrow FICAs wages definition is also consistent with the major principle of Rowan Cos. v. United States,

452 U.S. 247
: that simplicity of administration and consistency of statutory interpretation instruct that the meaning of wages should be in general the same for income-tax withholding and for FICA calculations.  Pp.714.
693 F.3d 605, reversed and remanded.

        
        Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Kagan, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

				LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL COMPONENTS, INC.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
			

				No. 12873.Argued December 3, 2013Decided March 25, 2014
			

				Petitioner Lexmark sells the only style of toner cartridges that work with the companys laser printers, but remanufacturers acquire and refurbish used Lexmark cartridges to sell in competition with Lexmarks own new and refurbished ones.  Lexmarks Prebate program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to return empty cartridges to the company.  Each Prebate cartridge has a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark replaces the chip.  Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed a microchip that mimicked Lexmarks.  Lexmark sued for copyright infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 

15 U.S.C. 1125(a), and that its misrepresentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its business reputation.  The District Court held that Static Control lacked prudential standing to bring the Lanham Act claim, applying a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 

459 U.S. 519
.  In reversing, the Sixth Circuit relied on the Second Circuits reasonable interest test.
			

				Held:Static Control has adequately pleaded the elements of a Lanham Act cause of action for false advertising.  Pp.622.
			

				
				
				(a)The question here is whether Static Control falls within the class of plaintiffs that Congress authorized to sue under 1125(a).  To decide that question, this Court must determine the provisions meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation.  It is misleading to label this a prudential standing question.  Lexmark bases its prudential standing arguments on Associated General Contractors, but that case rested on statutory considerations: The Court sought to ascertain, as a statutory-interpretation matter, the scope of the private remedy created by Congress in 4 of the Clayton Act, and the class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under that legislatively conferred cause of action, 459 U.S., at 529, 532.  And while this Court may have placed the zone of interests test that Static Control relies on under the prudential rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 

542 U.S. 1
, it does not belong there any more than Associated General Contractors does.  Rather, whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests requires the Court to determine, using traditional statutory-interpretation tools, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiffs claim.  See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 

523 U.S. 83
, and n.2.  Pp.69.
			

				
				
				(b)The 1125(a) cause of action extends to plaintiffs who fall within the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury was proximately caused by a violation of that statute.  Pp.1018.
			

				
				
				
				
				(1)A statutory cause of action is presumed to extend only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.  Allen v. Wright, 

468 U.S. 737
.  [T]he breadth of [that] zone ... varies according to the provisions of law at issue.  Bennett v. Spear, 

520 U.S. 154
.  The Lanham Act includes a detailed statement of its purposes, including, as relevant here, protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control of Congress] against unfair competition,  

15 U.S.C. 1127; and unfair competition was understood at common law to be concerned with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.  Thus, to come within the zone of interests in a 1125(a) false-advertising suit, a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.  Pp.1013.
			

				
				
				
				
				(2)A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.  See, e.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 

503 U.S. 258
270.  This requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is too remote from the defendants unlawful conduct, such as when the harm is purely derivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendants acts.  Id., at 268269.  In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising.  But since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries, the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proximate-cause showing the statute requires.  Cf. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 

553 U.S. 639
.  Thus, a plaintiff suing under 1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendants advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.  Pp.1315.
			

				
				
				
				
				(3)Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under 1125(a).  These principles provide better guidance than the multifactor balancing test urged by Lexmark, the direct-competitor test, or the reasonable-interest test applied by the Sixth Circuit.  Pp.1518.
			

				
				
				(c)Under these principles, Static Control comes within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under 1125(a).  Its alleged injurieslost sales and damage to its business reputationfall within the zone of interests protected by the Act, and Static Control sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmarks misrepresentations.  Pp.1822.
			

				697 F.3d 387, affirmed.

Lexmarks Prebate program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to return empty cartridges to the company. Every Prebate cartridge has a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark replaces the chip. Static Control makes and sells components for cartridge remanufacture and developed a microchip that mimicked Lexmarks. Lexmark sued for copyright infringement. Static Control counterclaimed that Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a), and caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its business reputation. The district court held that Static Control lacked prudential standing, applying a multifactor balancing test. The Sixth Circuit reversed, applying a reasonable interest test.  A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed. The Court stated that the issue was not prudential standing.  Whether a plaintiff comes within a statutes zone of interests requires traditional statutory interpretation. The Lanham Act includes in its statement of purposes, protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control of Congress] against unfair competition.  Unfair competition is concerned with injuries to business reputation and sales. A section 1125(a) plaintiff must show that its injury flows directly from the deception caused by the defendants advertising; that occurs when deception causes consumers to withhold trade from the plaintiff.  The zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement identify who may sue under section 1125(a) and provide better guidance than the multi-factor balancing test, the direct-competitor test, or the reasonable-interest test.  Static Control comes within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under section 1125(a). Its alleged injuries fall within the zone of interests protected by the Act, and it sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmarks misrepresentations.

MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST etal. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 121173.Argued January 14, 2014Decided March 10, 2014
Congress passed the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 to provide railroad companies right[s] of way through the public lands of the United States,

43 U.S.C. 934.  One such right of way, obtained by a railroad in 1908, crosses land that the United States conveyed to the Brandt family in a 1976 land patent.  That patent stated, as relevant here, that the land was granted subject to the railroads rights in the 1875 Act right of way, but it did not specify what would occur if the railroad later relinquished those rights.  Years later, a successor railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval.  The Government then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an order quieting title in the United States to the abandoned right of way, including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the Brandt patent.  Petitioners contested the claim, asserting that the right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the railroad abandoned it, so that Brandt now enjoys full title to his land without the burden of the easement.  The Government countered that the 1875 Act granted the railroad something more than a mere easement, and that the United States retained a reversionary interest in that land once the railroad abandoned it.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Government and quieted title in the United States to the right of way.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The right of way was an easement that was terminated by the railroads abandonment, leaving Brandts land unburdened.  Pp.817.

        
        (a)The Government loses this case in large part because it won when it argued the opposite in Great Northern R. Co. v. United States,

315 U.S. 262
.  There, the Government contended that the 1875 Act (unlike pre-1871 statutes granting rights of way) granted nothing more than an easement, and that the railroad in that case therefore had no interest in the resources beneath the surface of its right of way.  This Court adopted the Governments position in full.  It found the 1875 Acts text wholly inconsistent with the grant of a fee interest, id., at 271; agreed with the Government that cases describing the nature of rights of way granted prior to 1871 were not controlling because of a major shift in congressional policy concerning land grants to railroads after that year, id., at 278; and held that the 1875 Act clearly grants only an easement, id., at 271.  Under well-established common law property principles, an easement disappears when abandoned by its beneficiary, leaving the owner of the underlying land to resume a full and unencumbered interest in the land.  See Smith v. Townsend,

148 U.S. 490
.  Pp.812.

        
        (b)The Government asks this Court to limit Great Northerns characterization of 1875 Act rights of way as easements to the question of who owns the oil and minerals beneath a right of way.  But nothing in the 1875 Acts text supports that reading, and the Governments reliance on the similarity of the language in the 1875 Act and pre-1871 statutes directly contravenes the very premise of Great Northern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamentally different interest than did its predecessor statutes.  Nor do this Courts decisions in Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co.,

225 U.S. 142
, and Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke,

261 U.S. 119
, support the Governments position.  The dispute in each of those cases was framed in terms of competing claims to acquire and develop a particular tract of land, and it does not appear that the Court consideredmuch less rejectedan argument that the railroad had only an easement in the contested land.  But to the extent that those cases could be read to imply that the interest was something more, any such implication would not have survived this Courts unequivocal statement to the contrary in Great Northern.  Finally, later enacted statutes, see 43 U.S.C. 912, 940;

16 U.S.C. 1248(c), do not define or shed light on the nature of the interest Congress granted to railroads in their rights of way in 1875.  They instead purport only to dispose of interests (if any) the United States already possesses.  Pp.1217.

BG GROUP plc v. REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 12138.Argued December 2, 2013Decided March 5, 2014
An investment treaty (Treaty) between the United Kingdom and Argentina authorizes a party to submit a dispute to the decision of the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, i.e., a local court, Art. 8(1); and permits arbitration, as relevant here, where, after a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to [that] tribunal ..., the said tribunal has not given its final decision, Art. 8(2)(a)(i). 

        
        
        
        Petitioner BG Group plc, a British firm, belonged to a consortium with a majority interest in MetroGAS, an Argentine entity awarded an exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires.  At the time of BG Groups investment, Argentine law provided that gas tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars and would be set at levels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return.  But Argentina later amended the law, changing (among other things) the calculation basis to pesos.  MetroGAS profits soon became losses.  Invoking Article 8, BG Group sought arbitration, which the parties sited in Washington, D.C.  BG Group claimed that Argentinas new laws and practices violated the Treaty, which forbids the expropriation of investments and requires each nation to give fair and equitable treatment to investors from the other.  Argentina denied those claims, but also argued that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute because, as relevant here, BG Group had not complied with Article 8s local litigation requirement.  The arbitration panel concluded that it had jurisdiction, finding, among other things, that Argentinas conduct (such as also enacting new laws that hindered recourse to its judiciary by firms in BG Groups situation) had excused BG Groups failure to comply with Article 8s requirement.  On the merits, the panel found that Argentina had not expropriated BG Groups investment but had denied BG Group fair and equitable treatment.  It awarded damages to BG Group.  Both sides sought review in federal district court: BG Group to confirm the award under the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and Argentina to vacate the award, in part on the ground that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction under the FAA.  The District Court confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated.  It found that the interpretation and application of Article 8s requirement were matters for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference to the arbitrators views; that the circumstances did not excuse BG Groups failure to comply with the requirement; and that BG Group had to commence a lawsuit in Argentinas courts and wait 18 months before seeking arbitration.  Thus, the court held, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.
Held:

        
        1.A court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply threshold provisions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for interpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts.  Under that framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply.  Courts should review their interpretation with deference.  Pp.617.

        
        
        
        (a)Were the Treaty an ordinary contract, it would call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provision.  In an ordinary contract, the parties determine whether a particular matter is primarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide.  See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co.,

363 U.S. 574
.  If the contract is silent on the matter of who is to decide a threshold question about arbitration, courts determine the parties intent using presumptions.  That is, courts presume that the parties intended courts to decide disputes about arbitrability, e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,

537 U.S. 79
, and arbitrators to decide disputes about the meaning and application of procedural preconditions for the use of arbitration, see id., at 86, including, e.g., claims of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,

460 U.S. 1
, and the satisfaction of, e.g., time limits, notice, laches, [or] estoppel, Howsam, 537 U.S., at 85.  The provision at issue is of the procedural variety.  As its text and structure make clear, it determines when the contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to arbitrate at all.  Neither its language nor other language in Article 8 gives substantive weight to the local courts determinations on the matters at issue between the parties.  The litigation provision is thus a claims-processing rule.  It is analogous to other procedural provisions found to be for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply, see, e.g., ibid., and there is nothing in Article 8 or the Treaty to overcome the ordinary assumption.  Pp.79.

        
        
        
        (b)The fact that the document at issue is a treaty does not make a critical difference to this analysis.  A treaty is a contract between nations, and its interpretation normally is a matter of determining the parties intent.  Air France v. Saks,

470 U.S. 392
.  Where, as here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a motion to vacate or confirm an award made under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by American law.  The presence of a condition of consent to arbitration in a treaty likely does not warrant abandoning, or increasing the complexity of, the ordinary intent-determining framework.  See, e.g., Howsam, supra, at 8385.  But because this Treaty does not state that the local litigation requirement is a condition of consent, the Court need not resolve what the effect of any such language would be.  The Court need not go beyond holding that in the absence of language in a treaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different delegation of authority, the ordinary interpretive framework applies.  Pp.1013.

        
        
        
        (c)The Treaty contains no evidence showing that the parties had an intent contrary to the ordinary presumptions about who should decide threshold arbitration issues.  The text and structure of Article 8s litigation requirement make clear that it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration.  Because the ordinary presumption applies and is not overcome, the interpretation and application of the provision are primarily for the arbitrators, and courts must review their decision with considerable deference.  Pp.1317.

        
        2.While Argentina is entitled to court review (under a properly deferential standard) of the arbitrators decision to excuse BG Groups noncompliance with the litigation requirement, that review shows that the arbitrators determinations were lawful.  Their conclusion that the litigation provision cannot be construed as an absolute impediment to arbitration, in all cases, lies well within their interpretative authority.  Their factual findings that Argentina passed laws hindering recourse to the local judiciary by firms similar to BG Group are undisputed by Argentina and are accepted as valid.  And their conclusion that Argentinas actions made it absurd and unreasonable to read Article 8 to require an investor in BG Groups position to bring its grievance in a domestic court, before arbitrating, is not barred by the Treaty.  Pp.1719. 
665 F.3d 1363, reversed.

			An investment treaty between the U.K. and Argentina authorizes a party to submit a dispute to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, and permits arbitration if, 18 months after such submission, the tribunal has not made a final decision. BG, a British firm, had an interest in MetroGAS, an Argentine entity licensed to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires. At the time of BGs investment, Argentine law provided that gas tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars and would be set at levels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return. Argentina later changed the calculation basis to pesos. Profits became losses. BG sought arbitration, which was conducted in Washington, D. C. BG claimed that Argentina had violated the Treaty, which forbids expropriation of investments and requires each nation to give investors fair and equitable treatment. Argentina denied the claims and argued that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because BG had not complied with the local litigation requirement. The arbitration panel concluded that Argentinas enactment of laws that hindered recourse to its judiciary excused compliance and that Argentina had not expropriated BGs investment but had denied fair and equitable treatment. The district court confirmed the award. The District of Columbia Circuit vacated, holding that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court reversed.

When one parent abducts a child and flees to another country, the other parent may file a petition in that country for the return of the child pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention or Convention).  If the parent files a petition within one year of the childs removal, a court shall order the return of the child forthwith.  But when the petition is filed after the 1-year period expires, the court shall ... order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.

        
        
        
        Respondent Montoya Alvarez and petitioner Lozano resided with their daughter in London until November 2008, when Montoya Alvarez left with the child for a womens shelter.  In July 2009, Montoya Alvarez and the child left the United Kingdom and ultimately settled in New York.  Lozano did not locate Montoya Alvarez and the child until November 2010, more than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez and the child had left the United Kingdom.  At that point, Lozano filed a Petition for Return of Child pursuant to the Hague Convention in the Southern District of New York.  Finding that the petition was filed more than one year after removal, the court denied the petition on the basis that the child was now settled in New York.  It also held that the 1-year period could not be extended by equitable tolling.  The Second Circuit affirmed.
Held:Article 12s 1-year period is not subject to equitable tolling.  Pp.716.

        
        (a)The doctrine of equitable tolling, as applied to federal statutes of limitations, extends an otherwise discrete limitations period set by Congress.  Thus, whether tolling is available is fundamentally a question of statutory intent.  Because Congress legislate[s] against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles, Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,

501 U.S. 104
, including equitable tolling, see Holmberg v. Armbrecht,

327 U.S. 392
, equitable tolling is presumed to apply if the period in question is a statute of limitations and if tolling is consistent with the statute, Young v. United States,

535 U.S. 43
50.  Pp.78.  

        
        (b)In assessing whether equitable tolling applies to treaties, which are compact[s] between independent nations, Medelln v. Texas,

552 U.S. 491
, this Courts duty [i]s to ascertain the intent of the parties by looking to the documents text and context, United States v. Choctaw Nation,

179 U.S. 494
.  The parties to the Hague Convention did not intend equitable tolling to apply to Article 12s 1-year period.  Pp.816.

        
        
        
        (1)There is no general presumption that equitable tolling applies to treaties.  Though part of the established backdrop of American law, equitable tolling has no proper role in the interpretation of treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to the agreement among sovereign powers, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co.,

516 U.S. 217
.  Lozano has identified no such shared principle among the Convention signatories, and the courts of several signatories have explicitly rejected equitable tolling of the Convention.  Thus, the American presumption does not apply to this multilateral treaty.  The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. 1160111610, which Congress enacted to implement the Convention, neither addresses the availability of equitable tolling nor purports to alter the Convention, and therefore does not affect this conclusion.  Pp.911.

        
        
        
        (2)Even if the Convention were subject to a presumption that statutes of limitations may be tolled, Article 12s 1-year period is not a statute of limitations.  Statutes of limitations embody a policy of repose, designed to protect defendants, Burnett v. New York Central R. Co.,

380 U.S. 424
, and foster the elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiffs opportunity for recovery and a defendants potential liabilities, Rotella v. Wood,

528 U.S. 549
.  Here, the remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parentreturn of the childcontinues to be available after one year, thus preserving the possibility of relief for that parent and preventing repose for the abducting parent.  The periods expiration also does not establish certainty about the parties respective rights.  Instead, it opens the door to consideration of a third partys interests, i.e., the childs interest in settlement.  Because that is not the sort of interest addressed by a statute of limitations, the 1-year period should not be treated as a statute of limitations.  Young, supra, at 47, distinguished.  Pp.1113.

        
        
        
        (3)Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Convention does not support extending the 1-year period during concealment.  Article 12 explicitly provides for the period to commence on the date of the wrongful removal or retention and makes no provision for an extension.  Because the drafters did not choose to delay the periods commencement until discovery of the childs locationthe obvious alternative to the date of wrongful removalthe natural implication is that they did not intend to commence the period on that later date.  Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nonetheless consistent with the Conventions goal of deterring child abductions, but the Convention does not pursue that goal at any cost, having recognized that the return remedy may be overcome by, e.g., the childs interest in settlement.  And the abducting parent does not necessarily profit by running out the clock, since both American courts and other Convention signatories have considered concealment as a factor in determining whether a child is settled.  Equitable tolling is therefore neither required by the Convention nor the only available means to advance its objectives.  Pp.1315.

        
        
        
        (4)Lozano contends that there is room for United States courts to apply equitable tolling because the Convention recognizes that other sources of law may permit signatory states to return abducted children even when return is not available or required by the Convention.  But this contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling, which may be applied to the Hague Convention only if the treaty drafters so intended.  For the foregoing reason, they did not.  Pp.1516.
697 F.3d 41, affirmed.

        
        Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

When the petition is filed after that period, the court is to order return, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment. Because it was filed more than one year after removal, the district court denied the petition, finding that the child was now settled. The Second Circuit and Supreme Court affirmed. There is no presumption that equitable tolling applies to treaties and the parties to the Convention did not intend that it apply to the one-year period. The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U. S. C. 1160111610, enacted to implement the Convention, neither addresses equitable tolling nor purports to alter the Convention and, therefore, does not affect this conclusion. Even if the Convention were subject to a presumption that statutes of limitations may be tolled, the one-year period is not a statute of limitations. The remedy available to the left-behind parent continues to be available after one year; expiration of one year simply mandates consideration of a third partys interests. The drafters did not choose to delay the periods commencement until discovery of the childs location.

ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 12895.Argued November 12, 2013Decided March 5, 2014
Petitioner Justus Rosemond took part in a drug deal in which either he or one of his confederates fired a gun.  Because the shooters identity was disputed, the Government charged Rosemond with violating

18 U.S.C. 924(c) by using or carrying a gun in connection with a drug trafficking crime, or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting that offense under

18 U.S.C. 2.  The trial judge instructed the jury that Rosemond was guilty of aiding and abetting the 924(c) offense if he (1) knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime and (2) knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking crime.  This deviated from Rosemonds proposed instruction that the jury must find that he acted intentionally to facilitate or encourage the firearms use, as opposed to merely the predicate drug offense.  Rosemond was convicted, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting his argument that the District Courts aiding and abetting instructions were erroneous.
Held:

        
        1.The Government establishes that a defendant aided and abetted a 924(c) violation by proving that the defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crimes commission.  Pp.516.

        
        
        
        (a)The federal aiding and abetting statute, which derives from common-law standards for accomplice liability, has two components.  A person is liable under 2 only if he (1) takes an affirmative act in furtherance of the underlying offense (2) with the intent to facilitate that offenses commission.  Pp.56.

        
        
        
        (b)The first question is whether Rosemonds conduct was sufficient to satisfy the affirmative act requirement of aiding and abetting.  Section 924(c) has two elements: a drug deal or violent crime, and using or carrying a firearm in connection with that crime.  The instructions permitted the jury to convict Rosemond of aiding and abetting even if he facilitated only the drug element, and not the gun element, of the 924(c) offense.  Those instructions were correct.  The common law imposed aiding and abetting liability on a person who facilitated any element of a criminal offense, even if he did not facilitate all elements.  That principle continues to govern 2.  See, e.g., United States v. Johnson,

319 U.S. 503
.  Pp.611.

        
        
        
        (c)In addition to conduct extending to some part of the crime, aiding and abetting requires intent extending to the whole crime.  The defendant must not just associate himself with the venture, but also participate in it as something that he wishes to bring about and seek by his actions to make it succeed.  Nye & Nissen v. United States,

336 U.S. 613
.  That requirement is satisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense.  See Pereira v. United States,

347 U.S. 1
.  An active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a 924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun.  This must be advance knowledgemeaning, knowledge at a time when the accomplice has a reasonable opportunity to walk away.  Pp.1116.

        
        2.The trial courts jury instructions were erroneous because they failed to require that Rosemond knew in advance that one of his cohorts would be armed.  In telling the jury to consider merely whether Rosemond knew his cohort used a firearm, the court did not direct the jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requisite knowledgei.e., to decide whether Rosemond knew about the gun in sufficient time to withdraw from the crime.  The case is remanded to permit the Tenth Circuit to address whether this objection was properly preserved and whether any error was harmless.  Pp.1619.
695 F.3d 1151, vacated and remanded.

        
        Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined in all but footnotes 7 and 8.

LAWSON etal. v. FMR LLC etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 123.Argued November 12, 2013Decided March 4, 2014
To safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  One of the Acts provisions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provision instructed: No [public] company ..., or any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activity].

18 U.S.C. 1514A(a).    

        
        
        
        Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respondents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or manage mutual funds.  As is common in the industry, the mutual funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees.  Both plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by FMR.  Each commenced suit in federal court.  Moving to dismiss the suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under 1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public companies, and not employees of private companies that contract with public companies.  On interlocutory appeal from the District Courts denial of FMRs motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the term an employee in 1514A(a) refers only to employees of public companies.  
Held:The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  
670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.

        
        Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that 1514As whistleblower protection includes employees of a public companys private contractors and subcontractors.  Pp.929.

        
        (a)This reading of 1514A is supported by the provisions text.  Pp.916.

        
        
        
        (1)The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provisions language.  See Moskal v. United States,

498 U.S. 103
.  As relevant here, 1514A(a) provides that no ... contractor ... may discharge ... an employee.  The ordinary meaning of an employee in this proscription is the contractors own employee.  FMRs narrower construction requires inserting of a public company after an employee, but where Congress meant an employee of a public company, it said so.  

        
        The provision as a whole supports this reading.  The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in 1514A(a)discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment terms and conditionsare actions an employer takes against its own employees.  Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.  FMRs interpretation of 1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provisions ban on retaliation by contractors.  The protected activity covered by 1514A, and the provisions enforcement procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblowing employee.

LAWSON etal. v. FMR LLC etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 123.Argued November 12, 2013Decided March 4, 2014
To safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  One of the Acts provisions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provision instructed: No [public] company ..., or any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activity].

18 U.S.C. 1514A(a).    

        
        
        
        Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respondents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or manage mutual funds.  As is common in the industry, the mutual funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees.  Both plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by FMR.  Each commenced suit in federal court.  Moving to dismiss the suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under 1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public companies, and not employees of private companies that contract with public companies.  On interlocutory appeal from the District Courts denial of FMRs motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the term an employee in 1514A(a) refers only to employees of public companies.  
Held:The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  
670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.

        
        Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that 1514As whistleblower protection includes employees of a public companys private contractors and subcontractors.  Pp.929.

        
        (a)This reading of 1514A is supported by the provisions text.  Pp.916.

        
        
        
        (1)The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provisions language.  See Moskal v. United States,

498 U.S. 103
.  As relevant here, 1514A(a) provides that no ... contractor ... may discharge ... an employee.  The ordinary meaning of an employee in this proscription is the contractors own employee.  FMRs narrower construction requires inserting of a public company after an employee, but where Congress meant an employee of a public company, it said so.  

        
        The provision as a whole supports this reading.  The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in 1514A(a)discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment terms and conditionsare actions an employer takes against its own employees.  Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.  FMRs interpretation of 1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provisions ban on retaliation by contractors.  The protected activity covered by 1514A, and the provisions enforcement procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblowing employee.  Pp.914.

        
        
        
        (2)FMRs textual arguments are unpersuasive.  It urges that an employee must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their housekeepers or gardeners.  This concern appears more theoretical than real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments opposing FMRs reading of 1514A.

LAW v. SIEGEL, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 125196.Argued January 13, 2014Decided March 4, 2014
Petitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He valued his California home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was covered by Californias homestead exemption and thus was exempt from the bankruptcy estate.  See

11 U.S.C. 522(b)(3)(A).  He also claimed that the sum of two voluntary liensone of which was in favor of Lins Mortgage & Associatesexceeded the homes nonexempt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors.  Respondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the Lin lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litigation ensued when a supposed Lili Lin in China claimed to be the beneficiary of Laws deed of trust.  Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his equity in the house.  It thus granted Siegels motion to surcharge Laws $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to defray attorneys fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Laws fraudulent misrepresentations.  The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
Held:The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Laws homestead exemption be made available to pay Siegels attorneys fees.  Pp.512.

        
        (a)A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to carry out the provisions of the Code,

11 U.S.C. 105(a), or its inherent power ... to sanction abusive litigation practices, Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass.,

549 U.S. 365
376, by taking action prohibited elsewhere in the Code.  Here, the Bankruptcy Courts surcharge contravened 522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate, 522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 not liable for payment of any administrative expense, 522(k), including attorneys fees, see 503(b)(2).  The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the courts authority under 105(a) and its inherent powers.  Pp.57.

        
        (b)Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by surcharging exempt property in response to a debtors misconduct can coexist with 522.  But insofar as that argument equates the surcharge with an outright denial of Laws homestead exemption, it founders on this cases procedural history.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the homestead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.  And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge an exemption.  Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz,

503 U.S. 638
644.  Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Laws entitlement to the exemption, 522 specifies the criteria that render property exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtors invocation of an exemption without a valid statutory basis.  Federal courts may apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code.  Pp.710.

        
        (c)Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum points toward a different result.  There, the debtors bad faith kept him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by 706(a).  But that was because his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13, and thus he could not satisfy 706(d), which expressly conditions conversion on the debtors ability to qualify under Chapter 13.  Pp.1011.

        
        (d)This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden due to Laws egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable results for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter the balance that Congress struck in crafting 522.  Cf. Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund,

493 U.S. 365
377.  P.11.

        
        (e)Ample authority remains to address debtor misconduct, including denial of discharge, see 727(a)(2)(6); sanctions for bad-faith litigation conduct under the Bankruptcy Rules, 105(a), or a bankruptcy courts inherent powers; enforcement of monetary sanctions through the normal procedures for collecting money judgments, see 727(b); or possible prosecution under

18 U.S.C. 152.  Pp.1112.
435 Fed. Appx. 697, reversed and remanded.

        
        Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

UNITED STATES v. APEL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 121038.Argued December 4, 2013Decided February 26, 2014
Vandenberg Air Force Base has been designated a closed base, meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission.  The Air Force has granted an easement over two areas of the Base, with the result that two public highways traverse the Base.  Adjacent to one of those highways is an area that the Government has designated for peaceful protests.  The Base commander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stating that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may be barred from entering the Base.

        
        
        
        Petitioner Apel was barred from the Base for trespassing and vandalism, but continued to enter the protest area.  A Magistrate Judge convicted him of violating

18 U.S.C. 1382, which makes it a crime to reenter a military... installation after having been ordered not to do so by any officer or person in command.  On appeal, the Federal District Court rejected Apels defense that 1382 does not apply to the designated protest area.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession, 1382 did not cover the portion of the Base where Apels protest occurred. 
Held:A military... installation for purposes of 1382 encompasses the commanding officers area of responsibility, and it includes Vandenbergs highways and protest area.  Pp.614.

        
        (a)Contrary to Apels argument, 1382 does not require exclusive possession and control.  The statute is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the Governments possessory interest.  See United States v. Albertini,

472 U.S. 675
.  Nor have military places been defined historically as land withdrawn from public use.  The common feature of the places described in 1382 is that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.  This conclusion is confirmed by United States v. Phisterer,

94 U.S. 219
, which defined the term military station as a place where military duty is performed or military protection afforded.  And while some Executive Branch documents have said that 1382 requires exclusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has never held that the Governments reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.  Pp.710.

        
        (b)Section 1382 applies to any place with a defined boundary that is under the command of a military officer.  Apel contends that the highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie outside fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclusion.  The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force.  The Air Forces choice to secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries or diminish its commanders jurisdiction.  Apels further contention that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.  In any event, 1382 does not require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals.  Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise difficult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for public convenience.  Pp.1013.

UNITED STATES v. APEL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 121038.Argued December 4, 2013Decided February 26, 2014
Vandenberg Air Force Base has been designated a closed base, meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission.  The Air Force has granted an easement over two areas of the Base, with the result that two public highways traverse the Base.  Adjacent to one of those highways is an area that the Government has designated for peaceful protests.  The Base commander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stating that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may be barred from entering the Base.

        
        
        
        Petitioner Apel was barred from the Base for trespassing and vandalism, but continued to enter the protest area.  A Magistrate Judge convicted him of violating

18 U.S.C. 1382, which makes it a crime to reenter a military... installation after having been ordered not to do so by any officer or person in command.  On appeal, the Federal District Court rejected Apels defense that 1382 does not apply to the designated protest area.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession, 1382 did not cover the portion of the Base where Apels protest occurred. 
Held:A military... installation for purposes of 1382 encompasses the commanding officers area of responsibility, and it includes Vandenbergs highways and protest area.  Pp.614.

        
        (a)Contrary to Apels argument, 1382 does not require exclusive possession and control.  The statute is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the Governments possessory interest.  See United States v. Albertini,

472 U.S. 675
.  Nor have military places been defined historically as land withdrawn from public use.  The common feature of the places described in 1382 is that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.  This conclusion is confirmed by United States v. Phisterer,

94 U.S. 219
, which defined the term military station as a place where military duty is performed or military protection afforded.  And while some Executive Branch documents have said that 1382 requires exclusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has never held that the Governments reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.  Pp.710.

        
        (b)Section 1382 applies to any place with a defined boundary that is under the command of a military officer.  Apel contends that the highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie outside fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclusion.  The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force.  The Air Forces choice to secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries or diminish its commanders jurisdiction.  Apels further contention that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.  In any event, 1382 does not require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals.  Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise difficult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for public convenience.  Pp.1013.

        
        (c)Apels argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied was not reached by the Ninth Circuit and, thus, is not addressed here.  P.13.
676 F.3d 1202, vacated and remanded.

        
        Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Sotomayor, J., joined.  Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion."|"
			Vandenberg Air Force Base is a designated a closed base. Civilians may not enter without express permission.

The Base commander enacted rules to control the protest area and issued an advisory that anyone who fails to adhere to those policies may be barred from entering the Base.

A military ... installation encompasses the commanding officers area of responsibility, including Vandenbergs highways and protest area. Section1382 does not require exclusive possession and control.  Although the highways and protest area are outside fenced areas on the Base, the entire Vandenberg property is under the administration of the Air Force.  Although the Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch, section 1382 does not require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals.

Syllabus
CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 1279.Argued October 7, 2013Decided February 26, 2014[1]
The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (Litigation Act or Act) forbids the bringing of large securities class actions based upon the statutory or common law of any State in which the plaintiffs allege a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,

15 U.S.C. 78bb(f)(1).  The Act defines covered security to include, as relevant here, only securities traded on a national exchange.  78bb(f)(5)(E), 77r(b)(1).

        
        
        
        Four sets of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed civil class actions under state law, contending that the defendants, petitioners here, helped Allen Stanford and his companies perpetrate a Ponzi scheme by falsely representing that uncovered securities (certificates of deposit in Stanford International Bank) that plaintiffs were purchasing were backed by covered securities.  The District Court dismissed each case under the Litigation Act.  Although the certificates of deposit were not covered securities, the court concluded, the Banks misrepresentation that its holdings in covered securities made investments in its uncovered securities more secure provided the requisite connection (under the Litigation Act) between the plaintiffs state-law actions and transactions in covered securities.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that the falsehoods about the Banks holdings in covered securities were too tangentially related to the fraud to trigger the Litigation Act. 
Held:The Litigation Act does not preclude the plaintiffs state-law class actions.  Pp.819. 

        
        (a)Several factors support the conclusion that the scope of 78bb(f)(1)(A)s phrase misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security does not extend further than misrepresentations that are material to the decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to purchase or sell a covered security.  First, this interpretation is consistent with the Acts basic focus on transactions in covered, not uncovered, securities.  Second, the interpretation is supported by the Acts language.  The phrase material fact in connection with the purchase or sale suggests a connection that matters.  And a connection matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant difference to someones decision to purchase or to sell a covered security, not an uncovered one, something about which the Act expresses no concern.  See Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. ___, ___.  Further, for the connection to matter, the someone making the decision to purchase or sell a covered security must be a party other than the fraudster.  Third, the securities cases in which this Court has found a fraud to be in connection with a purchase or sale of a security, under both the Litigation Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (which also uses the in connection with phrase), have involved victims who took, who tried to take, who divested themselves of, who tried to divest themselves of, or who maintained an ownership interest in financial instruments that fall within the relevant statutory definition.  See, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit,

547 U.S. 71
.  Fourth, this Court reads the Litigation Act in light of and consistent with the language and purpose of the underlying regulatory statutes, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, which refer to persons engaged in securities transactions that lead to the taking or dissolving of ownership positions, and which make it illegal to deceive a person when he or she is doing so.  The basic purpose of the 1934 and 1933 regulatory statutes is to protect investor confidence in the securities markets.  Nothing in those statutes, or in the Litigation Act, suggests their object is to protect persons whose connection with the statutorily defined securities is more remote than buying or selling.  Fifth, a broader interpretation of the necessary statutory connection would interfere with state efforts to provide remedies for victims of ordinary state-law frauds, despite the fact that the Litigation Act purposefully seeks to avoid such results by maintaining States legal authority over matters that are primarily of state concern, see, e.g., 78bb(f)(4).  Pp.914.

        
        (b)Respondents and the Government make two important, but unavailing, counterarguments.  First, they point to this Courts suggestions that the phrase in connection with should be given a broad interpretation.  But every case in which this Court interpreted the phrase to cover a fraud involved a false statement (or the like) that was material to another individuals decision to purchase or s[ell] a statutorily defined security or covered security, e.g., Dabit, supra, at 7577, and where the transaction was by or on behalf of someone other than the fraudster.  Second, the Government warns that a narrow interpretation would curtail the Securities and Exchange Commissions enforcement powers under 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, which uses the same in connection with the purchase or sale phrase.  To the contrary, this Courts interpretation is perfectly consistent with past SEC practice.  The authority of the SEC and the Department of Justice extends to all securities under 10(b), not just to those traded on national exchanges.

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10).  The SEC has accordingly brought successful enforcement actions against Stanford and his associates, based on the Banks fraudulent sales of certificates of depositproducts that are securities even if not covered securities.  Neither the Government nor the dissent has pointed to an example of any prior SEC enforcement action that the instant holding would have prevented the SEC from bringing.  Pp.1417.

        
        (c)Respondents complaints do not allege, for Litigation Act purposes, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.  At most, they allege misrepresentations about the Banks ownership of covered securities.  But the Bank is the fraudster, not the fraudsters victim; nor is it some other person transacting in covered securities.  Thus, there is not the necessary connection between the materiality of the misstatements and the statutorily required purchase or sale of a covered security.  In addition, while the District Court found that one plaintiff acquired Bank certificates with proceeds from the sale of covered securities, the plaintiffs did not allege that the sale of these covered securities constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme or that Stanford or his associates were interested in how the plaintiffs obtained the funds to purchase the certificates.  Thus, those sales were only incidental to the fraud.  Pp.1719.
675 F.3d 503, affirmed.

No. 12464.Argued October 16, 2013
        
        Decided February 25, 2014
Title

21 U.S.C. 853(e)(1) empowers courts to enter pre-trial restraining orders to preserve the availability of [forfeitable] property while criminal proceedings are pending.  Such pre-trial asset restraints are constitutionally permissible whenever probable cause exists to think that a defendant has committed an offense permitting forfeiture and that the assets in dispute are traceable or otherwise sufficiently related to the crime charged.  United States v. Monsanto,

491 U.S. 600
.

        
        
        
        After a grand jury indicted petitioners, Kerri and Brian Kaley, for reselling stolen medical devices and laundering the proceeds, the Government obtained a 853(e)(1) restraining order against their assets.  The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, intending to use a portion of the disputed assets for their legal fees.  The District Court allowed them to challenge the assets traceability to the offenses in question but not the facts supporting the underlying indictment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:When challenging the legality of a 853(e)(1) pre-trial asset seizure, a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitutionally entitled to contest a grand jurys determination of probable cause to believe the defendant committed the crimes charged.  Pp.521.

        
        (a)In Monsanto, this Court held that the Government may seize assets before trial that a defendant intends to use to pay an attorney, so long as probable cause exists to believe that the property will ultimately be proved forfeitable.  491 U.S., at 615.  The question whether indicted defendants like the Kaleys are constitutionally entitled to a judicial re-determination of the grand jurys probable cause conclusion in a hearing to lift an asset restraint has a ready answer in the fundamental and historic commitment of the criminal justice system to entrust probable cause findings to a grand jury.  A probable cause finding sufficient to initiate a prosecution for a serious crime is conclusive[e], Gerstein v. Pugh,

420 U.S. 103
, and, as a general matter, a challenge to the reliability or competence of the evidence supporting that finding will not be heard, United States v. Williams,

504 U.S. 36
.  A grand jurys probable cause finding may, on its own, effect a pre-trial restraint on a persons liberty.  Gerstein, 420 U.S., at 117, n.19.  The same result follows when it works to restrain a defendants property.

        
        The Kaleys alternative rule would have strange and destructive consequences.  Allowing a judge to decide anew what the grand jury has already determined could result in two inconsistent findings governing different aspects of one criminal proceeding, with the same judge who found probable cause lacking presiding over a trial premised on its existence.  That legal dissonance could not but undermine the criminal justice systems integrity, especially the grand jurys constitutional role.  Pp.512.

        
        (b)The balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge,

424 U.S. 319
which requires a court to weigh (1) the burdens that a requested procedure would impose on the government against (2) the private interest at stake, as viewed alongside (3) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest without the procedure and the probable value, if any, of [the] additional ... procedural safeguar[d], id., at 335if applicable here, tips against the Kaleys.  Because the Governments interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal charges and the Kaleys interest in retaining counsel of their own choosing are both substantial, the tests third prong is critical.  It boils down to the probable value, if any, of a judicial hearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings.  But when the legal standard is merely probable cause and the grand jury has already made that finding, a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit.  See Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  A finding of probable cause to think that a person committed a crime can be [made] reliably without an adversary hearing, Gerstein, 420 U.S., at 120, and the value of requiring additional formalities and safeguards would [i]n most cases ... be too slight, id., at 121122.  The experience of several Circuits corroborates this view.  Neither the Kaleys nor their amici point to a single case in two decades where courts, holding hearings of the kind they seek, have found the absence of probable cause to believe that an indicted defendant committed the crime charged.  Pp.1220.
677 F. 3d 1316, affirmed and remanded.

which requires a court to weigh (1) the burdens that a requested procedure would impose on the government against (2) the private interest at stake, as viewed alongside (3) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest without the procedure and the probable value, if any, of [the] additional ... procedural safeguar[d], id., at 335if applicable here, tips against the Kaleys.  Because the Governments interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal charges and the Kaleys interest in retaining counsel of their own choosing are both substantial, the tests third prong is critical.  It boils down to the probable value, if any, of a judicial hearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings.  But when the legal standard is merely probable cause and the grand jury has already made that finding, a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit.  See Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  A finding of probable cause to think that a person committed a crime can be [made] reliably without an adversary hearing, Gerstein, 420 U.S., at 120, and the value of requiring additional formalities and safeguards would [i]n most cases ... be too slight, id., at 121122.  The experience of several Circuits corroborates this view.  Neither the Kaleys nor their amici point to a single case in two decades where courts, holding hearings of the kind they seek, have found the absence of probable cause to believe that an indicted defendant committed the crime charged.  Pp.1220.
677 F. 3d 1316, affirmed and remanded.

        
        Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Roberts, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined."|"
			After a grand jury indicted the Kaleys for reselling stolen medical devices and laundering the proceeds, the government obtained a restraining order against their assets under 21 U.S.C. 853(e)(1), to preserve the availability of [forfeitable] property while criminal proceedings are pending. An order is available if probable cause exists to think that a defendant has committed an offense permitting forfeiture and the disputed assets are traceable or sufficiently related to the crime.  The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, to use disputed assets for their legal fees. The district court allowed them to challenge traceability to the crimes but not the facts supporting the underlying indictment. The Eleventh Circuit and Supreme Court affirmed. In challenging a section 853(e)(1) pre-trial seizure, an indicted defendant is not entitled to contest the grand jury determination of probable cause to believe the defendant committed the crimes. A probable cause finding sufficient to initiate prosecution for a serious crime is conclusive and, generally, a challenge to the reliability or competence of evidence supporting that finding will not be heard.  A grand jurys probable cause finding may effect a pre-trial restraint on a persons liberty or property. Because the governments interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal charges and the Kaleys interest in retaining counsel of their own choosing are both substantial, the issue boils down to the probable value, if any, of a judicial hearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings. The legal standard is merely probable cause, however, and the grand jury has already made that finding; a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit.

WALDEN v. FIORE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 12574.Argued November 4, 2013Decided February 25, 2014
Petitioner Walden, a Georgia police officer working as a deputized Drug Enforcement Administration agent at a Georgia airport, searched respondents and seized a large amount of cash.  Respondents allege that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds forfeiture and forwarded it to a United States Attorneys Office in Georgia.  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents funds were returned.  Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in Federal District Court in Nevada.  The District Court dismissed the suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise jurisdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with significant Nevada connections.

FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district
No. 127822.Argued November 13, 2013Decided February 25, 2014
Police officers observed a suspect in a violent robbery run into an apartment building, and heard screams coming from one of the apartments.  They knocked on the apartment door, which was answered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding.  When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and objected.  Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest.  He was then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to the police station.  An officer later returned to the apartment and, after obtaining Rojas oral and written consent, searched the premises, where he found several items linking petitioner to the robbery.  The trial court denied petitioners motion to suppress that evidence, and he was convicted.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  It held that because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented to the search, the exception to permissible warrantless consent searches of jointly occupied premises that arises when one of the occupants present objects to the search, Georgia v. Randolph,

547 U.S. 103
, did not apply, and therefore, petitioners suppression motion had been properly denied.
Held:Randolph does not extend to this situation, where Rojas consent was provided well after petitioner had been removed from their apartment.  Pp.515.

        
        (a)Consent searches are permissible warrantless searches, Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,

412 U.S. 218
232, and are clearly reasonable when the consent comes from the sole occupant of the premises.  When multiple occupants are involved, the rule extends to the search of the premises or effects of an absent, nonconsenting occupant so long as the consent of one who possesses common authority over [the] premises or effects is obtained.  United States v. Matlock,

415 U.S. 164
.  However, when a physically present inhabitan[t] refuses to consent, that refusal is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.  Randolph, 547 U.S., at 122123.  A controlling factor in Randolph was the objecting occupants physical presence.  See, e.g., id., at 106, 108, 109, 114.  Pp.59.

        
        (b)Petitioner contends that, though he was not present when Rojas consented, Randolph nevertheless controls, but neither of his arguments is sound.  Pp.914.

        
        
        
        (1)He first argues that his absence should not matter since it occurred only because the police had taken him away.  Dictum in Randolph suggesting that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient if there is evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection, 547 U.S., at 121, is best understood to refer to situations in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively reasonable.  Petitioner does not contest the fact that the police had reasonable grounds for his removal or the existence of probable cause for his arrest.  He was thus in the same position as an occupant absent for any other reason.  Pp.910.

        
        
        
        (2)Petitioner also argues that the objection he made while at the threshold remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew it.  This is inconsistent with Randolph in at least two important ways.  It cannot be squared with the widely shared social expectations or customary social usage upon which Randolphs holding was based.  547 U.S., at 111, 121.  It also creates the sort of practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid by adopting a formalis[tic] rule, id., at 121, e.g., requiring that the scope of an objections duration and the procedures necessary to register a continuing objection be defined.  Pp.1014.

        
        (c)Petitioner claims that his expansive interpretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where officers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they also have probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the premises that the objector does not want them to enter.  But he misunderstands the constitutional status of consent searches, which are permissible irrespective of the availability of a warrant.  Requiring officers to obtain a warrant when a warrantless search is justified may interfere with law enforcement strategies and impose an unmerited burden on the person willing to consent to an immediate search.  Pp.1415.

ANTHONY RAY HINTON v. ALABAMA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of alabama
No. 136440Decided February 24, 2014


        
        Per Curiam.

        
        In Strickland v. Washington,

466 U.S. 668 (1984)
, we held that a criminal defendants
 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated if his trial attorneys performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different absent the deficient act or omission.  Id., at 687688, 694.  Anthony Ray Hinton, an inmate on Alabamas death row, asks us to decide whether the Alabama courts correctly applied Strickland to his case.  We conclude that they did not and hold that Hintons trial attorney rendered constitutionally deficient performance.  We vacate the lower courts judgment and remand the case for reconsideration of whether the attorneys deficient performance was prejudicial.
I
A

        
        In February 1985, a restaurant manager in Birming-ham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours rob-bery of his restaurant.  A second manager was murderedduraing a very similar robbery of another restaurant inJuly.  Then, later in July, a restaurant manager named Smotherman survived another similar robbery-shooting.  During each crime, the robber fired two .38 caliber bullets; all six bullets were recovered by police investigators.  Smotherman described his assailant to the police, and when the police showed him a photographic array, he picked out Hintons picture.

        
        The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house a .38 caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared the house with him.  After analyzing the six bullets fired during the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, examiners at the States Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that the six bullets had all been fired fromthe same gun: the revolver found at Hintons house.  Hinton was charged with two counts of capital murder forthe killings during the first two robberies.  He was not charged in connection with the third robbery (that is, the Smotherman robbery).

        
        At trial, the States strategy was to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery through eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman and then to persuade the jury that, in light of the similar-ity of the three crimes and forensic analysis of the bullets and the Hinton revolver, Hinton must also have committed the two murders.  Smotherman identified Hinton as the man who robbed his restaurant and tried to kill him, and two other witnesses provided testimony that tended to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery.  Hinton maintained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had misidentified him.  In support of that defense, Hinton presented witnesses who testified in support of his alibi that he was at work at a warehouse at the time of the Smotherman robbery.  See 548 So.2d 562, 568569 (Ala. 1989) (summarizing the evidence on each side of the case).

        
        The six bullets and the revolver were the only physical evidence.  Besides those items, the police found no evidence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify the perpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminating evidence at Hintons home or in his car.  The States case turned on whether its expert witnesses could convince the jury that the six recovered bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver.  According to the Alabama Supreme Court, the only evidence linking Hinton to the two murders were forensic comparisons of the bullets recovered from those crime scenes to the Hinton revolver.  2008 WL 4603723, *2 (Oct. 17, 2008).

        
        The category of forensic evidence at issue in this case is firearms and toolmark evidence.  Toolmark examiners attempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a crime scene was fired from a particular gun by comparing microscopic markings (toolmarks) on the recovered bullet to the markings on a bullet known to have been fired from that gun.  The theory is that minor differences even between guns of the same model will leave discernible traces on bullets that are unique enough for an examiner to conclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired from a given weapon.  See generally National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 150155 (2009).

        
        Recognizing that Hintons defense called for an effective rebuttal of the States expert witnesses, Hintons attorney filed a motion for funding to hire an expert witness of his own.  In response, the trial judge granted $1,000 with this statement:
I dont know as to what my limitations are as for how much I can grant, but I can grant up to $500.00 in each case [that is, for each of the two murder charges, which were tried together] as far as I know right now and Im granting up to $500.00 in each of these two cases for this.  So if you need additional experts I would go ahead and file on a separate form and Ill have to see if I can grant additional experts, but I am granting up to $500.00, which is the statutory maximum as far as I know on this and if its necessary that we go beyond that then I may check to see if we can, but this ones granted. 2006 WL 1125605, *59 (Ala. Crim. App., Apr. 28, 2006) (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. 10).
Hintons attorney did not take the judge up on his invitation to file a request for more funding.

        
        In fact, $500 per case ($1,000 total) was not the statu-tory maximum at the time of Hintons trial.  An earlier version of the statute had limited state reimbursement of expenses to one half of the $1,000 statutory cap on attorneys fees, which explains why the judge believed that Hinton was entitled to up to $500 for each of the two murder charges.  See Smelley v. State, 564 So.2d 74, 88 (Ala. Crim. App. 1990).  But the relevant statute had been amended to provide: Counsel shall also be entitled to be reimbursed for any expenses reasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in advance by the trial court.  See Dubose v. State, 662 So.2d 1156, 1177, n.5 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993) (quoting Ala. Code 151221(d) (1984)), affd 662 So.2d 1189 (Ala. 1995).  That amendment went into effect on June 13, 1984, Dubose, supra, at 1177, n. 5, which was over a year before Hinton was arrested, so Hintons trial attorney could have corrected the trial judges mistaken belief that a $1,000 limit applied and accepted his invitation to file a motion for additional funds.

        
        The attorney failed to do so because he was himself unaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific limit and instead allowed reimbursement for any expenses reasonably incurred.  At an evidentiary hearing held on Hintons postconviction petition, the following conversation occurred between a state attorney and Hintons trial attorney:
Q.  You did an awful lot of work to try and find what you believed to be a qualified expert in this case, didnt you?
A.  Yes, sir, I did.
Q.  Would you characterize it that you did everything that you knew to do?
A.  Yes, sir, I think so.
Q.  And this case, did it come down to an unwillingness of experts to work for the price that you were able to pay?
A.  Yes, sir, I think it did.
Q.  So your failure to get an expert that you would have been lets say a hundred percent satisfied with was not a failure on your part to go out and do some act, it was a failure of the court to approve what you believed would have been sufficient funds?
A.  Well, putting it a little differently, yes, sir, it was a failureit was my failure, my inability under the statute to obtain any more funding for the purpose of hiring qualified experts.  Reporters Official Tr. 206207 (emphasis added).

        
        Operating under the mistaken belief that he could pay no more than $1,000, Hintons attorney went looking for an expert witness.  According to his postconviction testimony, he made an extensive search for a well-regarded expert, but found only one person who was willing to take the case for the pay he could offer: Andrew Payne.  Hintons attorney testified that Payne did not have the expertise he thought he needed and that he did not consider Paynes testimony to be effective.  2006 WL 1125605, *27.  As he told the trial judge during a pretrial hearing:
I made an effort to get somebody that I thought would be useable.  And Ill have to tell you what I did [about] Payne.  I called a couple of other lawyers in town ... to ask if they knew of anybody.  One of them knew him; one of them knew him.  The reason I didnt contact him was because he wasnt recommended by the lawyer.  So now Im stuck that hes the only guy I could possibly produce.  Id., at *30 (internal quotation marks omitted).

        
        At trial, Payne testified that the toolmarks in the barrel of the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it would be impossible to say with certainty whether a particular bullet had been fired from that gun.  He also testified that the bullets from the three crime scenes did not match one another.  The States two experts, by contrast, maintained that all six bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver.

        
        On cross-examination, the prosecutor badly discredited Payne.  Payne admitted that hed testified as an expert on firearms and toolmark identification just twice in the preceding eight years and that one of the two cases involved a shotgun rather than a handgun.  Payne also conceded that he had had difficulty operating the microscope at the state forensic laboratory and had asked for help from one of the state experts.  The prosecutor ended the cross-examination with this colloquy:
Q.  Mr. Payne, do you have some problem with your vision?
A.  Why, yes.
Q.  How many eyes do you have?
A.  One.  Tr. 1667.

        
        The prosecutors closing argument highlighted the fact that Paynes expertise was in military ordnance, not firearms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had graduated in 1933 (more than half a century before the trial) with a degree in civil engineering, whereas the States experts had years of training and experience in the field of firearms and toolmark examination.  The prosecutor said:
I ask you to reject [Paynes] testimony and you have that option because you are the judges of the facts and whose testimony, Mr. Yates or Mr. Paynes, you will give credence to, and I submit to you that as between these two men there is no match between them.  There is no comparison.  One man just doesnt have it and the other does it day in and day out, month in and month out, year in and year out, and is recognized across the state as an expert.  2006 WL 1125605, *64 (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. 17331734).

        
        The jury convicted Hinton and recommended by a 10-to-2 vote that he be sentenced to death.  The trialjudge accepted that recommendation and imposed a death sentence.
B

        
        In his state postconviction petition, Hinton contended that his trial attorney was ineffective to not seek additional funds when it became obvious that the individual willing to examine the evidence in the case for the $1,000 allotted by the court was incompetent and unqualified.  Indeed, this failure to seek additional, sufficient funds is rendered all the more inexplicable by the trial courts express invitation to counsel to seek more funds if such funds were necessary.  2006 WL 1125605, *28.

        
        To show that he had been prejudiced by Paynes ineffective testimony, Hinton produced three new experts on toolmark evidence.  One of the three, a forensic consultant named John Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification at the Federal Bureau of Investigations forensics laboratory and, from 1988 until he retired in 1994, had served as chief of the firearms and toolmark unit at the FBIs headquarters.  The other two postconviction experts had worked for many years as firearms and toolmark examiners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had each testified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases.

        
        All three experts examined the physical evidence and testified that they could not conclude that any of the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver.  The State did not submit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction hearing, and one of Hintons experts testified that, pursuant to the ethics code of his trade organization, the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, he had asked the States expert, Yates, to show him how he had determined that the recovered bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver.  Yates refused to cooperate.
C

        
        The circuit court denied Hintons postconviction petition on the ground that Hinton had not been prejudiced by Paynes allegedly poor performance because Paynes testimony did not depart from what Hintons postconviction experts had said: The bullets could not be affirmatively matched either to one another or to the Hinton revolver.

        
        The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed by a 3-to-2 vote.  2006 WL 1125605.  The court agreed with the circuit court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because Paynes testimony, if believed by the jury, strongly supported the inference that Hinton was innocent.  Id., at *31.  Then-Judge Cobb (who later became chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court) dissented.  In her view, Hintons attorney had been ineffective in failing to seek additional funds to hire a better expert and Hinton had been prejudiced by that failure, meaning that he was entitled to a new trial.  Then-Judge Shaw (who is now a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court) also dissented.  He would have remanded the case to the circuit court to make a finding as to whether or not Payne was qualified to act as an expert on toolmark evidence.  He stated that [i]t goes without saying that, with knowledge that sufficient funds were available to have a qualified firearms and toolmarks expert, no reasonable criminal defense lawyer would seek out and hire an unqualified firearms witness.  Id., at *73.

        
        The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded.  2008 WL 4603723.  After quoting at length from Judge Shaws dissent, the Court stated, We agree with Judge Shaw that the dispositive issue is whether Payne was a qualified firearms and toolmarks expert and that in denying Hintons [postconviction] petition the trial court did not directly rule on the issue whether Payne was qualified to be testifying in the first place.  Id., at *4 (quoting  2006 WL 1125605, *70, *72 (Shaw, J., dissenting)).  The Supreme Court was thus focused on Paynes own qualifications, rather than on whether a better expertone who could have been hired had the attorney learned that there was no funding cap and requested additional fundswould have made a more compelling case for Hinton.

        
        On remand, the circuit court held that Payne was indeed qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert witness under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place at the time of the trial, which required only that Payne have had knowledge of firearms and toolmarks exam-ination beyond that of an average layperson.  2008 WL 5517591, *5 (Ala. Crim. App., Dec. 19, 2008); see also Charles v. State, 350 So. 2d 730, 733 (Ala. Crim. App. 1977) (An expert witness is one who can enlighten a jury more than the average man in the street.... An expert witness, by definition, is any person whose opportunity or means of knowledge in a specialized art or science is to some degree better than that found in the average juror or witness).  The appellate court affirmed the circuit courts ruling that Payne was qualified under the applicable standard.  2013 WL 598122 (Ala. Crim. App., Feb. 15, 2013).  The Alabama Supreme Court denied review by a 4-to-3 vote, with two justices recused.  Hinton then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.
II

        
        This case calls for a straightforward application of our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel precedents, beginning with Strickland v. Washington,

466 U.S. 668
.  Strickland recognized that the
 
Sixth Amendments guarantee that [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence entails that defendants are entitled to be represented by an attorney who meets at least a minimal standard of competence.  Id., at 685687.  Under Strickland, we first determine whether counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Then we ask whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Padilla v. Kentucky,

559 U.S. 356,
366 (2010)
 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688, 694).
A

        
        The first prongconstitutional deficiencyis necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.  Padilla, supra, at 366 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688).  In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsels assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.  Strickland, supra, at 688.  Under that standard, it was unreasonable for Hintons lawyer to fail to seek additional funds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding was capped at $1,000.

        
        Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and available defense strategy requires consultation with experts or introduction of expert evidence.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16).  This was such a case.  As Hintons trial attorney recognized, the core of the prosecutions case was the state experts conclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver, and effectively rebutting that case required a competent expert on the defense side.  Hintons attorney also recognized that Payne was not a good expert, at least with respect to toolmark evidence.  Nonetheless, he felt he was stuck with Payne because he could not find a better expert willing to work for $1,000 and he believed that he was unable to obtain more than $1,000 to cover expert fees.

        
        As discussed above, that belief was wrong: Alabama law in effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was arrested provided for state reimbursement of any expenses reasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in advance by the trial court.  Ala. Code 151221(d).  And the trial judge expressly invited Hintons attorney to file a request for further funds if he felt that more funding was necessary.  Yet the attorney did not seek further funding.

        
        The trial attorneys failure to request additional funding in order to replace an expert he knew to be inadequate because he mistakenly believed that he had received all he could get under Alabama law constituted deficient performance.  Under Strickland, strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.  In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.  466 U.S., at 690691.  Hintons attorney knew that he needed more funding to present an effective defense, yet he failed to make even the cursory investigation of the state statute providing for defense funding for indigent defendants that would have revealed to him that he could receive reimbursement not just for $1,000 but for any expenses reasonably incurred.  An attorneys ignorance of a point of law that is fundamental to his case combined with his failure to perform basic research on that point is a quintessential example of unreasonable performance under Strickland.  See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor,

529 U.S. 362
, 395 (2000) (finding deficient performance where counsel failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records [that could be used for death penalty mitigation purposes], not because of any strategic calcu-lation but because they incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such records); Kimmelman v. Morrison,

477 U.S. 365,
385 (1986)
 (finding deficient performance where counsel failed to conduct pretrial discovery and that failure was not based on strategy, but on counsels mistaken belie[f] that the State was obliged to take the initiative and turn over all of its inculpatory evidence to the defense).

        
        We wish to be clear that the inadequate assistance of counsel we find in this case does not consist of the hiring of an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified enough.  The selection of an expert witness is a paradigmatic example of the type of strategic choic[e] that, when made after thorough investigation of [the] law and facts, is virtually unchallengeable.  Strickland, 466 U.S., at 690.  We do not today launch federal courts into examination of the relative qualifications of experts hired and experts that might have been hired.  The only inadequate assistance of counsel here was the inexcusable mistake of lawthe unreasonable failure to understand the resources that state law made available to himthat caused counsel to employ an expert that he himself deemed inadequate.
B

        
        Having established deficient performance, Hinton must also show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  Id., at 694.  When a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.  Id., at 695.

        
        The Court of Criminal Appeals held, and the State contends in its brief in opposition to certiorari, that Hinton could not have been prejudiced by his attorneys use of Payne rather than a more qualified expert because Payne said all that Hinton could have hoped for from a toolmark expert: that the bullets used in the crimes could nothave been fired from the Hinton revolver.  See 2006 WL 1125605, *31 ([E]ven assuming that counsels apparent ignorance that the cap on expert expenses had been lifted constituted deficient performance ..., the appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by that deficient performance).  It is true that Paynes testimony would have done Hinton a lot of good if the jury had believed it.  But the jury did not believe Payne.  And if there is a reasonable probability that Hintons attorney would have hired an expert who would have instilled in the jury a reasonable doubt as to Hintons guilt had the attorney known that the statutory funding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was prejudiced by his lawyers deficient performance and is entitled to a new trial.

        
        That the State presented testimony from two experienced expert witnesses that tended to inculpate Hinton does not, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is guilty.  Prosecution experts, of course, can sometimes make mistakes.  Indeed, we have recognized the threat to fair criminal trials posed by the potential for incompetent or fraudulent prosecution forensics experts, noting that [s]erious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials.... One study of cases in which exon-erating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases.  Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts,

557 U.S. 305,
319 (2009)
 (citing Garrett & Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.Rev. 1, 14 (2009)).  This threat is minimized when the defense retains a competent expert to counter the testimony of the prosecutions expert witnesses; it is maximized when the defense instead fails to understand the resources available to it by law.

        
        Because no court has yet evaluated the prejudice question by applying the proper inquiry to the facts of this case, we remand the case for reconsideration of whether Hintons attorneys deficient performance was prejudicial under Strickland.
***

        
        The petition for certiorari and Hintons motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

			In 1985, a manager was shot to death during a robbery of his restaurant. In the following months, a second manager was murdered and another survived similar robberies.  In each restaurant, the robber fired two .38 caliber bullets; all six bullets were recovered. The survivor, Smotherman, described his assailant and picked Hintons picture out of a photographic array. The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house a .38 caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared the house. The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that the six bullets had all been fired from the Hinton revolver. Hinton was charged with two counts of murder. He was not charged with the Smotherman robbery. The prosecution strategy was to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery by eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence about the bullets and to persuade the jury that, given the similarity of the crimes, Hinton must have committed the murders. Hinton presented witnesses in support of his alibi that he was at work at the time of the Smotherman robbery. The six bullets and the revolver were the only physical evidence. Hintons attorney obtained a grant of $1,000 to hire an expert to challenge that evidence and did not request more funding, nor correct the judges mistaken belief that a $1,000 limit applied. Under that mistaken belief, Hintons attorney found only one person who was willing to testify: Payne. Hintons attorney believed that Payne did not have the necessary expertise. The prosecutor discredited Payne. The jury convicted Hinton; the court imposed a death sentence.  In state post-conviction proceedings, Hinton alleged ineffective assistance and produced three highly credible experts, who testified that they could not conclude that any of the bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The state did not submit rebuttal evidence. Following a remand by the states highest court, the trial court held that Payne was qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert under the then-applicable standard. The Alabama Supreme Court denied review. The U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding that Hintons attorney rendered ineffective assistance under its Strickland test. It was unreasonable to fail to seek additional funds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding was limited.

AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER
certiorari to the supreme court of colorado
No. 12315.Argued December 9, 2013Decided January 27, 2014
Respondent Hoeper was a pilot for petitioner Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp.  When Air Wisconsin stopped flying from Hoepers home base on aircraft that he was certified to fly, he needed to become certified on a different type of aircraft to keep his job.  After Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to gain certification, Air Wisconsin agreed to give him a fourth and final chance.  But he performed poorly during a required training session in a simulator.  Hoeper responded angrily to this failureraising his voice, tossing his headset, using profanity, and accusing the instructor of railroading the situation.

        
        
        
        The instructor called an Air Wisconsin manager, who booked Hoeper on a flight from the test location to Hoepers home in Denver.  Several hours later, the manager discussed Hoepers behavior with other airline officials.  The officials discussed Hoepers outburst, his impending termination, the history of assaults by disgruntled airline employees, and the chance thatbecause Hoeper was a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation,

49 U.S.C. 44921(f)(1)he might be armed.  At the end of the meeting, an airline executive made the decision to notify the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the situation.  The manager who had received the initial report from Hoepers instructor made the call to the TSA.  During that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that Hoeper was an FFDO who may be armed and that the airline was concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm; and second, that an [u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today.  In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun.  Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air Wisconsin fired him the next day.

        
        
        
        Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court.  Air Wisconsin moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior,

49 U.S.C. 44941(a), except where such disclosure is made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading or made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure, 44941(b).  The trial court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity question to the jury.  The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  It held that the trial court erred in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error was harmless.  Laboring under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly, the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity because its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.
Held: 

        
        1.ATSA immunity may not be denied to materially true statements.  Pp.711.

        
        
        
        (a)The ATSA immunity exception is patterned after the actual malice standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,

376 U.S. 254
, which requires material falsity.  See, e.g., Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,

501 U.S. 496
.  Because the material falsity requirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress presumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSAs immunity exception and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made recklessly.  This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of statutory meaning.  Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and 44941(b)(2) simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones.  Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the purpose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information.  Pp.710.

        
        
        
        (b)Hoepers arguments that the State Supreme Courts judgment should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of ATSAs immunity standard are unpersuasive.  Hoeper claims that Air Wisconsin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immunity, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSAs immunity exception incorporates the New York Times actual malice standard, which requires material falsity.  And the State Supreme Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in finding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict.  A courts deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine falsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity.  Pp.1011.

        
        2.Under the correct material falsity analysis, Air Wisconsin is entitled to immunity as a matter of law.  Pp.1218.

        
        
        
        (a)In the defamation context, a materially false statement is one that would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the ... truth would have produced.  Masson, 501 U.S., at 517.  This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well, so long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.  For purposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.  Pp.1213.

        
        
        
        (b)Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hoeper, the Court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in Air Wisconsins statement to the TSA were not material.  First, the Court rejects Hoepers argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified its statement that Hoeper was an FFDO who may be armed by noting that it had no reason to think he actually was armed.  To the extent that Air Wisconsins statement could have been confusing, any such confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officerhaving been told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his jobwould have wanted to investigate whether he was armed.  To demand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats.  Second, Air Wisconsins statement that Hoeper was terminated today was not materially false.  While Hoeper had not actually been fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that his firing was imminent.  No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.  Finally, although the details of Hoepers behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoepers version of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper blew up during the test.  From a reasonable security officers perspective, there is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had blown up in a professional setting and a statement that he was unstable.  Air Wisconsins related statement that it was concerned about [Hoepers] mental stability is no more troubling.  Many of the officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of mental stability, but it would be inconsistent with the ATSAs text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airlines concern.  A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as the gist of the statement is accurate, Masson, 501 U.S., at 517.  Pp.1318.
Reversed and remanded.

        
        Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, Thomas, and Kagan, JJ., joined as to Parts I, II, and IIIA.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Thomas and Kagan, JJ., joined.

The manager who had received the initial report from Hoepers instructor made the call to the TSA.  During that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that Hoeper was an FFDO who may be armed and that the airline was concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm; and second, that an [u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today.  In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun.  Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air Wisconsin fired him the next day.

        
        
        
        Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court.  Air Wisconsin moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior,

49 U.S.C. 44941(a), except where such disclosure is made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading or made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure, 44941(b).  The trial court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity question to the jury.  The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  It held that the trial court erred in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error was harmless.  Laboring under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly, the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity because its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.
Held: 

        
        1.ATSA immunity may not be denied to materially true statements.  Pp.711.

        
        
        
        (a)The ATSA immunity exception is patterned after the actual malice standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,

376 U.S. 254
, which requires material falsity.  See, e.g., Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,

501 U.S. 496
.  Because the material falsity requirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress presumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSAs immunity exception and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made recklessly.  This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of statutory meaning.  Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and 44941(b)(2) simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones.  Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the purpose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information.  Pp.710.

        
        
        
        (b)Hoepers arguments that the State Supreme Courts judgment should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of ATSAs immunity standard are unpersuasive.  Hoeper claims that Air Wisconsin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immunity, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSAs immunity exception incorporates the New York Times actual malice standard, which requires material falsity.  And the State Supreme Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in finding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict.  A courts deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine falsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity.  Pp.1011.

        
        2.Under the correct material falsity analysis, Air Wisconsin is entitled to immunity as a matter of law.  Pp.1218.

        
        
        
        (a)In the defamation context, a materially false statement is one that would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the ... truth would have produced.  Masson, 501 U.S., at 517.  This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well, so long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.  For purposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.  Pp.1213.

        
        
        
        (b)Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hoeper, the Court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in Air Wisconsins statement to the TSA were not material.  First, the Court rejects Hoepers argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified its statement that Hoeper was an FFDO who may be armed by noting that it had no reason to think he actually was armed.  To the extent that Air Wisconsins statement could have been confusing, any such confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officerhaving been told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his jobwould have wanted to investigate whether he was armed.  To demand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats.  Second, Air Wisconsins statement that Hoeper was terminated today was not materially false.  While Hoeper had not actually been fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that his firing was imminent.  No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.  Finally, although the details of Hoepers behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoepers version of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper blew up during the test.  From a reasonable security officers perspective, there is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had blown up in a professional setting and a statement that he was unstable.  Air Wisconsins related statement that it was concerned about [Hoepers] mental stability is no more troubling.  Many of the officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of mental stability, but it would be inconsistent with the ATSAs text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airlines concern.  A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as the gist of the statement is accurate, Masson, 501 U.S., at 517.  Pp.1318.
Reversed and remanded.

			After Air Wisconsin stopped flying aircraft that Hoeper was certified to fly, Hoeper failed three attempts to gain new certification. Air Wisconsin gave him one final chance. He performed poorly during required training and responded angrily, tossing his headset, using profanity, and making accusations against the instructor. Airline officials discussed the outburst, Hoepers impending termination; the history of assaults by disgruntled employees; and the chance that Hoeper, a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation, 49 U.S.C. 44921(f)(1) might be armed. An airline executive notified the TSA that Hoeper was an FFDO who may be armed, that the airline was concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm, and that an [u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today. The TSA removed Hoeper (returning home from training) from his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun.  Hoeper sued for defamation. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), 49 U.S.C. 44941(a), provides airlines and employees immunity for reporting suspicious behavior except where such disclosure is made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading or made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.  The jury found for Hoeper. The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed. ATSA immunity, patterned after the Times v. Sullivan actual malice standard, may not be denied to materially true statements, even if made recklessly; a falsehood cannot be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response. Any falsehoods in the statement to the TSA were not material. A reasonable TSA officer, knowing that Hoeper was an FFDO, upset about losing his job, would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed. While Hoeper had not actually been fired at that time, everyone knew that termination was imminent.  It would be inconsistent with the ATSAs text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airlines concern.

SANDIFER etal. v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 12417.Argued November 4, 2013Decided January 27, 2014
Petitioner Sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert respondent UnitedStates Steel Corporation requires workers to wear because of hazards at its steel plants.  U.S. Steel contends that this donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collective-bargaining agreement with petitioners union.  That provisions validity depends on

29 U.S.C. 203(o), which allows parties to collectively bargain over whether time spent in changing clothes...at the beginning or end of each workday must be compensated.  The District Court granted U.S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, holding that petitioners donning and doffing constituted changing clothes under 203(o).  It also assumed that any time spent donning and doffing items that were not clothes was de minimis and hence noncompensable.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:The time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective gear is not compensable by operation of 203(o).  Pp.315.

        
        (a)This Court initially construed compensability under the Fair Labor Standards Act expansively.  See, e.g., Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,

328 U.S. 680
.  The Act was amended in 1949, however, to provide that the compensability of time spent changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining, 203(o).  Whether petitioners donning and doffing qualifies as changing clothes depends on the meaning of that statutory phrase.  Pp.36.

        
        (b)The term clothes, which is otherwise undefined, is interpreted as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.  Perrin v. United States,

444 U.S. 37
.  In dictionaries from the era of 203(o)s enactment, clothes denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.  Nothing in 203(o)s text or context suggests anything other than this ordinary meaning.  There is no basis for petitioners proposition that the unmodified term clothes somehow omits protective clothing.  Section 203(o)s exception applies only when the changing of clothes is an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed, Steiner v. Mitchell,

350 U.S. 247
, and thus otherwise compensable under the Act.  See

29 U.S.C. 254(a).  And protective gear is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such as butchers and longshoremen.  Petitioners position is also incompatible with the historical context of 203(o)s passage, contradicting contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in Steiner, see 350 U.S., at 248, 254255.  The interpretation adopted here leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices.  The view of respondent and its amici that clothes encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual foundation.  Pp.610.

        
        (c)While the normal meaning of changing clothes connotes substitution, changing also carried the meaning to alter at the time of 203(o)s enactment.  The broader statutory context makes plain that time spent in changing clothes includes time spent in altering dress.  Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely personal choice, and 203(o) should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another reading is textually permissible.  Pp.1011.

        
        (d)Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning and doffing in this case qualifies as changing clothes under 203(o).  Of the 12 items at issue, only 3safety glasses, earplugs, and a respiratordo not fit within the elaborated interpretation of clothes.  Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of Appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law does not take account of trifles).  But that doctrine does not fit comfortably within this statute, which is all about trifles.  A more appropriate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as time spent in changing clothes or washing.  If an employee devotes the vast majority of that time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the entire period would not qualify as time spent in changing clothes under 203(o), even if some clothes items were also donned and doffed.  But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and doffing clothes as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.  Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Courts conclusion that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs was minimal.  And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District Courts additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Circuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during the normal workday and thus fell beyond 203(o)s scope.  Pp.1215.
678 F.3d 590, affirmed.

BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 127515.Argued November 12, 2013Decided January 27, 2014
Long-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that included using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage.  Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia, that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that death ... resulted from the use of th[at] substancethus subjecting Burrage to a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhancement provision of the Controlled Substances Act,

21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(C).  After medical experts testified at trial that Banka might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Bankas death could only result from heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-for cause of death.  The court denied the motion and, as relevant here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that heroin was a contributing cause of death.  The jury convicted Burrage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years.  In affirming, the Eighth Circuit upheld the District Courts jury instruction.
Held:At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victims death or serious bodily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement under 841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury.  Pp.415.

There is no need to address a special rule developed for cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concurrently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Bankas heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death.

			Long-time drug user Banka died after a binge that included use of heroin purchased from Burrage. Burrage pleaded not guilty to charges that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that death ... resulted from the use of th[at] substance, which carries a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(C). Medical experts testified that Banka might have died even if he had not taken the heroin. The court instructed the jury that the prosecution had to prove only that heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Burrage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The Supreme Court reversed. Where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of death or serious bodily injury, the penalty enhancement does not apply unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury.  The Court declined to address cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concurrently, produce death, because there was no evidence that Bankas heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. Congress could have written the statute to refer to a substantial or contributing factor in producing death, but instead used language that imports but-for causality.

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 121128.Argued November 5, 2013Decided January 22, 2014
Petitioner Medtronic, Inc., designs, makes, and sells medical devices.  Respondent Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators.  They have a licensing agreement that permits Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments, and that specifies procedures to identify products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the parties.  Pursuant to those procedures, Mirowski notified Medtronic of its belief that several of Medtronics products infringed the licensed patents, and Medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringement in a declaratory judgment action, while accumulating disputed royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party.  The District Court concluded that Mirowski, as the party asserting infringement, had the burden of proving infringement and that Mirowski had not met that burden.  The Federal Circuit disagreed.  It acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof, but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant and, like Mirowski, is foreclosed from asserting an infringement counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agreement, the party seeking the declaratory judgment, namely Medtronic, bears the burden of persuasion.
Held:

        
        1.The Federal Circuit did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction in this case.  Title

28 U.S.C. 1338(a) gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, and 1295(a)(1) gives the Federal Circuit appellate jurisdiction over any case where jurisdiction in the district court was based, in whole or in part, on section 1338.  The Declaratory Judgment Act does not extend the federal courts jurisdiction, Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,

339 U.S. 667
; and federal courts determining declaratory judgment jurisdiction often look to the character of the declaratory judgment defendants threatened action, Public Serv. Commn of Utah v. Wycoff Co.,

344 U.S. 237
, i.e., whether the defendants hypothetical coercive action would necessarily present a federal question, Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,

463 U.S. 1
.  Here, if Medtronic had acted consistent with the understanding of its rights that it seeks to establish through the declaratory judgment suit (by ceasing to pay royalties), Mirowski could terminate the license and bring a suit for infringement.  That suit would arise under federal patent law because patent law creates the cause of action.  Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp.,

486 U.S. 800
.  Thus, this declaratory judgment action, which avoids that hypothetical threatened action, also arises under federal patent law.  See, e.g., Security-First Nat. Bank of Los Angeles v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.,

368 U.S. 3
.  Pp.46.

        
        2.When a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee that its products do not infringe the licensed patent, the patentee bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of infringement.  Pp.611. 

        
        
        
        (a)This conclusion is strongly supported by three settled legal propositions:First, a patentee ordinarily bears the burden of proving infringement, see, e.g., Agawam Co. v. Jordan, 7 Wall. 583, 609; second, the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is only procedural, Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,

300 U.S. 227
, leaving substantive rights unchanged, Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover,

359 U.S. 500
; and third, the burden of proof is a substantive aspect of a claim, Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue,

530 U.S. 15
21.  Practical considerations lead to the same conclusion.  Shifting the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about a patents scope.  It may also create unnecessary complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative.  Finally, burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the Declaratory Judgment Acts purpose of ameliorating the dilemma posed by putting one challenging a patents scope to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking suit, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,

549 U.S. 118
.  To the extent that the Federal Circuits burden shifting rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous, that rule recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid.  Pp.69.

        
        
        
        (b)Several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  First, Schaffer v. Weast,

546 U.S. 49
, which noted the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs have the risk of failing to prove their claims, does not support the Federal Circuits conclusion.  Schaffer was not a declaratory judgment case, and it described exceptions to its basic burden of proof rule.  For reasons explained in this case, declaratory judgment suits like this one are an exception to Schaffers default rule.  Second, the fact that the Federal Circuit limited its holding to the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counterclaim by a patentee cannot, by itself, show that the holding is legally justified.  Third, contrary to one amicus concern that this Courts holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into full-blown infringement litigation, such litigation can occur only when there is a genuine and sufficiently immedia[te] dispute about a patents validity or application, MedImmune, supra, at 127.  Here, Mirowski set this dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement, and there is no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor the patentee.  General considerations relating to the public interest in maintaining a well-functioning patent system are, at most, in balance, and do not favor changing the ordinary burden of proof rule.  Pp.911.
695 F.3d 1266, reversed and remanded.

        
        Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. etal. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF INTERNATIONAL UNION OF OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 12992.Argued December 9, 2013Decided January 15, 2014
Respondents, various union-affiliated benefit funds (Funds), sued petitioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) in Federal District Court to collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.  The Funds also sought attorneys fees and costs, which were obligations under both a federal statute and the parties collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  The District Court issued an order on June 17, 2011, on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on July 25 on the Funds motion for fees and costs.  The Funds appealed both decisions on August 15.  Haluch argued that the June 17 order was a final decision pursuant to

28 U.S.C. 1291, and thus, the Funds notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedures 30-day deadline.  The Funds disagreed, arguing that there was no final decision until July 25.  The First Circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorneys fees issue generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final, but held that no final decision was rendered until July 25 since the entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the CBA was an element of damages and thus part of the merits.  Accordingly, the First Circuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contributions and the fees and costs.
Held:The appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely.  Pp.513.

        
        (a)This case has instructive similarities to Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co.,

486 U.S. 196
.  There, this Court held a district court judgment to be a final decision for 1291 purposes despite an unresolved motion for statutory-based attorneys fees, noting that fee awards do not remedy the injury giving rise to the action, are often available to the defending party, and were, at common law, an element of costs awarded to a prevailing party, not a part of the merits judgment.  Id., at 200.  Even if laws authorizing fees might sometimes treat them as part of the merits, considerations of operational consistency and predictability in the overall application of 1291 favored a uniform rule.  Id., at 202.  Pp.57.

        
        (b)The Funds attempts to distinguish Budinich fail.  Pp.713.

        
        
        
        (1)Their claim that contractual attorneys fees provisions are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for such provisions often provide attorneys fees to prevailing defendants.  More basic, Budinichs uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits, 486 U.S., at 201, and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning here.  The operational consistency stressed in Budinich is not promoted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute.  Nor is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory.  The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation, but the Budinich Court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uniform rule, and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbalanced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed, especially given the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorneys fees claims.  Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases.  See, e.g., Rules 54(d)(2), 58(e).  Complex variations in statutory and contractual fee-shifting provisions also counsel against treating attorneys fees claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality purposes.  The Budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.  The Funds suggest that it is unclear whether Budinich applies where, as here, nonattorney professional fees are included in a motion for attorneys fees and costs.  They are mistaken to the extent that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contractual fee claim is involved.  Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees, see West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,

499 U.S. 83
, n.4, and there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell that Budinich remains applicable where such fees are claimed and awarded incidental to attorneys fees.  Pp.711.

        
        
        
        (2)The Funds claim that fees accrued prior to the commencement of litigation fall outside the scope of Budinich is also unpersuasive.  Budinich referred to fees for the litigation in question, 486 U.S., at 202, or attributable to the case, id., at 203, but this Court has observed that some of the services performed before a lawsuit is formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are performed on the litigation, Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of Ed.,

471 U.S. 234
.  Here, the fees for investigation, preliminary legal research, drafting of demand letters, and working on the initial complaint fit the description of standard preliminary steps toward litigation.  Pp.1113.

DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 11965.Argued October 15, 2013Decided January 14, 2014
Plaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state security forces during Argentinas 19761983 Dirty War to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs.  Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California and Argentina law.  Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey.  MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including California.  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.  Opposing that motion, plaintiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA.  The District Court granted Daimlers motion to dismiss.  Reversing the District Courts judgment, the Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the California courts all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimlers agent for jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be answerable to suit in that State.

DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 11965.Argued October 15, 2013Decided January 14, 2014
Plaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state security forces during Argentinas 19761983 Dirty War to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs.  Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California and Argentina law.  Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey.  MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including California.  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.  Opposing that motion, plaintiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA.  The District Court granted Daimlers motion to dismiss.  Reversing the District Courts judgment, the Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the California courts all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimlers agent for jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be answerable to suit in that State.  
Held:Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries allegedly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside the United States.  Pp.624.

Syllabus
MISSISSIPPI exrel. HOOD, ATTORNEY GENERAL  v. AU OPTRONICS CORP. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 121036.Argued November 6, 2013Decided January 14, 2014
Congress enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) to lower diversity jurisdiction requirements in class actions and, as relevant here, in mass actions, i.e., civil actions in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,

28 U.S.C. 1332(d)(11)(B)(i).  Petitioner Mississippi sued respondent liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers in state court, alleging violations of state law and seeking, inter alia, restitution for LCD purchases made by itself and its citizens.  Respondents sought to remove the case to federal court.  The District Court held that the suit qualified as a mass action under 1332(d)(11)(B)(i), but remanded the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within CAFAs general public exception, 1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).  The Fifth Circuit reversed, agreeing with the District Court that the suit was a mass action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.
Held:Because Mississippi is the only named plaintiff, this suit does not constitute a mass action under CAFA.  Pp.514.

        
        (a)Contrary to respondents argument, CAFAs 100 or more persons phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real parties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs.  Congress knew how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning, see, e.g., 1332(d)(5)(B), 1332(d)(1)(D).  That it did not do so in the mass action provision indicates that Congress did not want the provisions numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed individuals who possess an interest in the suit.

        
        Respondents understanding also cannot be reconciled with the fact that the 100 or more persons are not unspecified individuals with no participation in the suit but are the plaintiffs subsequently referred to in the provision, i.e., the very parties proposing to join their claims in a single trial.  This is evident in two key ways.  First, CAFA uses persons and plaintiffs the same way they are used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, which refers to persons as individuals who are proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.  Second, it is difficult to imagine how the claims of 100 or more unnamed individuals could be proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the ... claims of some completely different group of named plaintiffs involve common questions of law or fact.

        
        Construing plaintiffs to include both named and unnamed real parties in interest would stretch the meaning of plaintiff beyond recognition.  A plaintiff is commonly understood to be a party who brings a civil suit in a court of law, not anyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit.  Moreover, respondents definition would also have to apply to the mass action provisions subsequent reference to plaintiffs in the phrase jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000], 1332(d)(11)(B)(i).  See Brown v. Gardner,

513 U.S. 115
.  This would result in an administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have intended, see Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,

458 U.S. 564
, where district courts would have to identify hundreds (or in this case, hundreds of thousands) of unnamed parties whose claims are for less than $75,000 and then decide how to dispose of their claims.  Pp.510.

        
        (b)Statutory context reinforces this Courts reading of the mass action provision.  CAFA provides that once removal occurs, a case shall not be transferred to another court unless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.  1332(d)(11)(C)(i).  If plaintiffs included unnamed parties, it would be surpassingly difficult for a court to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide whether an action may be transferred.  Moreover, respondents position that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFAs relaxed class action jurisdictional rules cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device.  Had Congress wanted CAFA to authorize removal of representative actions brought by States as sole plaintiffs on respondents theory, it would have done so through the class action provision, not the mass action provision.  Pp.1011.

        
        (c)This Court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity jurisdiction, see, e.g., Wecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co.,

204 U.S. 176
186, but Congress did not intend this background inquiry to apply to the mass action provision.  First, it could make sense to incorporate the background inquiry into the mass action provision if the inquiry had previously been applied in a similar manner.  That is not the case here, however, and so any presumption that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists at all, would be comparatively weak.  Second, even if the background principle had previously been applied in this manner, Congress expressly indicated that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision both through the textual indicators described above and by prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, 1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II).  Requiring district courts to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.  Pp.1113.
701 F.3d 796, reversed and remanded.
