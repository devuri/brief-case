14-1372|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
RANDY WHITE, WARDEN v. ROGER L. WHEELER
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 141372.Decided December 14, 2015

Per Curiam.
A death sentence imposed by a Kentucky trial court and affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court has been overturned, on habeas corpus review, by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  During the jury selection process, the state trial court excused a juror after concluding he could not give sufficient assurance of neutrality or impartiality in considering whether the death penalty should be imposed.  The Court of Appeals, despite the substantial deference it must accord to state-court rulings in federal habeas proceedings, determined that excusing the juror in the circumstances of this case violated the Sixth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments.  That ruling contravenes controlling precedents from this Court, and it is now necessary to reverse the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.
Warden Randy White is the petitioner here, and the convicted prisoner, Roger Wheeler, is the respondent.
In October 1997, police in Louisville, Kentucky, found the bodies of Nigel Malone and Nairobi Warfield in the apartment the couple shared.  Malone had been stabbed nine times.  Warfield had been strangled to death and a pair of scissors stuck out from her neck.  She was pregnant.  DNA taken from blood at the crime scene matched respondents.  Respondent was charged with the murders.
During voirdire, Juror 638 gave equivocal and inconsistent answers when questioned about whether he could consider voting to impose the death penalty.  In response to the judges questions about his personal beliefs on the death penalty, Juror 638 said, Im not sure that I have formed an opinion one way or the other.  I believe there are arguments on both sides of theof it.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a.  When asked by the prosecution about his ability to consider all available penalties, Juror 638 noted he had never been confronted with that situation in a, in a real-life sense of having to make that kind of determination.  Id., at 131a.  So its difficult for me, he explained, to judge how I would I guess act, uh.  Ibid.  The prosecution sought to clarify Juror 638s answer, asking if the juror meant he was not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically consider the death penalty.  Id., at 132a.  Juror 638 replied, I think that would be the most accurate way I could answer your question.  Ibid.  During defense counsels examination, Juror 638 described himself as a bit more contemplative on the issue of taking a life and, uh, whether or not we have the right to take that life.  Id., at 133a.  Later, however, he expressed his belief that he could consider all the penalty options.  Id., at 134a.
The prosecution moved to strike Juror 638 for cause based on his inconsistent replies, as illustrated by his statement that he was not absolutely certain he could realistically consider the death penalty.  The defense opposed the motion, arguing that Juror 638s answers indicated his ability to consider all the penalty options, despite having some reservations about the death penalty.  The judge said that when she was done questioning Juror 638, she wrote in her notes that the juror could consider [the] entire range of penalties.  Id., at 138a.  She further stated that she did not see him as problematic at the end of her examination.  Ibid.  But she also noted that she did not hear him say that he couldnt realistically consider the death penalty, and reserved ruling on the motion until she could review Juror 638s testimony.  Ibid.  The next day, after reviewing the relevant testimony, the judge struck Juror 638 for cause.  When she announced her decision to excuse the juror, the trial judge stated, And when I went back and reviewed [the jurors] entire testimony, [the prosecution] concluded with saying, Would it be accurate to say that you couldnt, couldnt consider the entire range?  And his response isI think was, I think that would be pretty accurate.  So, Im going to sustain that one, too.  Id., at 139a140a.
The case proceeded to trial.  Respondent was convicted of both murders and sentenced to death.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentence.  Wheeler v. Commonwealth, 121 S.W. 3d 173, 189 (2003).  In considering respondents challenges to the trial courts excusal of certain jurors for cause, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the trial judge appropriately struck for cause those jurors that could not impose the death pen-alty....  There was no error and the rights of the defendant to a fair trial by a fair and impartial jury ... under both the federal and state constitutions were not violated.  Id., at 179.
After exhausting available state postconviction procedures, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under

28 U.S.C. 2254 from the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  He asserted, inter alia, that the Kentucky trial court erred in striking Juror 638 during voirdire on the ground that the juror could not give assurances that he could consider the death penalty as a sentencing option.  The District Court dismissed the petition; but a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, granting habeas relief as to respondents sentence.  Wheeler v. Simpson, 779 F.3d 366, 379 (2015).  While acknowledging the deferential standard required on federal habeas review of a state conviction, the Court of Appeals held that allowing the exclusion of Juror 638 was an unreasonable application of Witherspoon v. Illinois,

391 U.S. 510 (1968)
, Wainwright v. Witt,

469 U.S. 412 (1985)
, and their progeny.  779 F.3d, at 372374.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), habeas relief is authorized if the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.

28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  This Court, time and again, has instructed that AEDPA, by setting forth necessary predicates before state-court judgments may be set aside, erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court.  Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6).  Under 2254(d)(1), a state prisoner must show that the state courts ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.  White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Harrington v. Richter,

562 U.S. 86,
103 (2011)
).
The Court of Appeals was required to apply this deferential standard to the state courts analysis of respondents juror exclusion claim.  In Witherspoon, this Court set forth the rule for juror disqualification in capital cases.  Witherspoon recognized that the
 
Sixth Amendments guarantee of an impartial jury confers on capital defendants the right to a jury not uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.  391 U.S., at 521.  But the Court with equal clarity has acknowledged the States strong interest in having jurors who are able to apply capital punishment within the framework state law prescribes.  Uttecht v. Brown,

551 U.S. 1,
9 (2007)
.  To ensure the proper balance between these two interests, only a juror who is substantially impaired in his or her ability to impose the death penalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause.  Ibid.  As the Court explained in Witt, a juror may be excused for cause where the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law.  469 U.S., at 425426.
Reviewing courts owe deference to a trial courts ruling on whether to strike a particular juror regardless of whether the trial court engages in explicit analysis regarding substantial impairment; even the granting of a motion to excuse for cause constitutes an implicit finding of bias.  Uttecht, 551 U.S., at 7.  A trial courts finding may be upheld even in the absence of clear statements from the juror that he or she is impaired ....  Ibid.  And where, as here, the federal courts review a state-court ruling under the constraints imposed by AEDPA, the federal court must accord an additional and independent, high standard of deference.  Id., at 10.  As a result, federal habeas reviewof a Witherspoon-Witt claimmuch like federal habeas review of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claimmust be doubly deferential.  Burt, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster,

563 U. S. 170,
190 (2011)
).
The Court of Appeals held that the Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably applied Witherspoon, Witt, and their progeny when it determined that removing Juror 638 for cause was constitutional.  779 F.3d, at 372374.  The Court of Appeals determined Juror 638 understood the decisions he would face and engaged with them in a thoughtful, honest, and conscientious manner.  Id., at 373.  In the Court of Appeals estimation, the trial judge concluded the juror was not qualified only by misapprehending a single question and answer exchange between Juror 638 and the prosecution, id., at 374the exchange in which Juror 638 stated he was not absolutely certain he could realistically consider the death penalty, id., at 372.  According to the Court of Appeals, Juror 638 agreed he did not know to an absolute certainty whether he could realistically consider the death penalty, but the court proceeded as if he knew he could not.  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals further determined that if the trial judge, when reviewing Juror 638s examination, had properly processed that exchange between Juror 638 and the prosecution, Juror 638 would not have been excused.  Id., at 374.
Both the analysis and the conclusion in the decision under review were incorrect.  While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that deference was required under AEDPA, it failed to ask the critical question: Was the Kentucky Supreme Courts decision to affirm the excusal of Juror 638 for cause so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement?  Woodall, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting Harrington, supra, at 103).
The Court of Appeals did not properly apply the deference it was required to accord the state-court ruling.  A fairminded jurist could readily conclude that the trial judges exchange with Juror 638 reflected a diligent and thoughtful voirdire; that she considered with care the jurors testimony; and that she was fair in the exercise of her broad discretion in determining whether the juror was qualified to serve in this capital case.  Uttecht, 551 U.S., at 20.  Juror 638s answers during voirdire were at least ambiguous as to whether he would be able to give appropriate consideration to imposing the death penalty.  And as this Court made clear in Uttecht, when there is ambiguity in the prospective jurors statements, the trial court is entitled to resolve it in favor of the State.  Id., at 7 (quoting Witt, supra, at 434).
The Court of Appeals erred in its assessment of the trial judges reformulation of an important part of Juror 638s questioning.  779 F.3d, at 372.  When excusing the juror the day after the voirdire, the trial judge said that the prosecution had asked whether the juror couldnt con-sider the entire range of penalties.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a.  The prosecution in fact asked if the juror was not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically con-sider the entire range of penalties.  Id., at 132a.  The jurors confirmation that he was not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically consider the death penalty, ibid., was a reasonable basis for the trial judge to conclude that the juror was unable to give that penalty fair consideration.  The trial judges decision to excuse Juror 638 did not violate clearly established federal law by concluding that Juror 638 was not qualified to serve as a member ofthis capital jury.  See Witt, supra, at 424426.  And similarly, the Kentucky Supreme Courts ruling that therewas no error is not beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.
The Court of Appeals noted that the deference toward trial courts recognized in Uttecht was largely premised on the trial judges ability to observe the demeanor of the juror.  779 F.3d, at 373 (quoting 551 U.S., at 17).  It concluded that deference to the trial court here supported habeas relief, because the trial judges initial assessment of [the jurors] answers and demeanor did not lead her to immediately strike Juror 638 for cause.  779 F.3d, at 373374.
The Court of Appeals conclusion conflicts with the meaning and holding of Uttecht and with a common-sense understanding of the jury selection process.  Nothing in Uttecht limits the trial court to evaluating demeanor alone and not the substance of a jurors response.  And the implicit suggestion that a trial judge is entitled to less deference for having deliberated after her initial ruling is wrong.  In the ordinary case the conclusion should be quite the opposite.  It is true that a trial courts contemporaneous assessment of a jurors demeanor, and its bearing on how to interpret or understand the jurors responses, are entitled to substantial deference; but a trial court ruling is likewise entitled to deference when made after a careful review of a formal transcript or recording.  If the trial judge chooses to reflect and deliberate further, as this trial judge did after the proceedings recessed for the day, that is not to be faulted; it is to be commended.
This is not a case where the record discloses no basis for a finding of substantial impairment.  Uttecht, supra, at 20.  The two federal judges in the majority below might have reached a different conclusion had they been presiding over this voirdire.  But simple disagreement does not overcome the two layers of deference owed by a federal habeas court in this context.
***
The Kentucky Supreme Court was not unreasonable in its application of clearly established federal law when it concluded that the exclusion of Juror 638 did not violate the
 
Sixth Amendment.  Given this conclusion, there is no need to consider petitioners further contention that, if there were an error by the trial court in excluding the juror, it should be subject to harmless-error analysis.  And this Court does not review the other rulings of the Court of Appeals that are not addressed in this opinion.
As a final matter, this Court again advises the Court of Appeals that the provisions of AEDPA apply with full force even when reviewing a conviction and sentence imposing the death penalty.  See, e.g., Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. ___ (2012) (per curiam); Bobby v. Dixon, 565 U.S. ___ (2011) (per curiam); Bobby v. Mitts,

563 U.S. 395 (2011)
 (per curiam); Bobby v. Van Hook,

558 U.S. 4 (2009)
 (per curiam).
The petition for certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

DIRECTV, INC. v. IMBURGIA etal.
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district, division one
No. 14462.Argued October 6, 2015Decided December 14, 2015
Petitioner DIRECTV, Inc., and its customers entered into a service agreement that included a binding arbitration provision with a class-arbitration waiver.  It specified that the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable if the law of your state made class-arbitration waivers unenforceable.  The agreement also declared that the arbitration clause was governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.  At the time that respondents, California residents, entered into that agreement with DIRECTV, California law made class-arbitration waivers unenforceable, see Discover Bank v. Superior Court, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.3d 1100.  This Court subsequently held in AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,

563 U.S. 333
, however, that Californias Discover Bank rule was pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act,

9 U.S.C. 2.
When respondents sued petitioner, the trial court deniedDIRECTVs request to order the matter to arbitration, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The court thought that California law would render class-arbitration waivers unenforceable, so it held the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable under the agreement.  The fact that the Federal Arbitration Act pre-empted that California law did not change the result, the court said, because the parties were free to refer in the contract to California law as it would have been absent federal pre-emption.  The court reasoned that the phrase law of your state was both a specific provision that should govern more general provisions and an ambiguous provision that should be construed against the drafter.  Therefore, the court held, the parties had in fact included California law as it would have been without federal pre-emption.
Held:Because the California Court of Appeals interpretation is pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act, that court must enforce the arbitration agreement.  Pp.511.
(a)No one denies that lower courts must follow Concepcion, but that elementary point of law does not resolve the case because the parties are free to choose the law governing an arbitration provision, including California law as it would have been if not pre-empted.  The state court interpreted the contract to mean that the parties did so, and the interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a matter of state law to which this Court defers, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,

.  The issue here is not whether the courts decision is a correct statement of California law but whether it is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.  Pp.56.
(b)The California courts interpretation does not place arbitration contracts on equal footing with all other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,

546 U.S. 440
, because California courts would not interpret contracts other than arbitration contracts the same way.  Several considerations lead to this conclusion.
First, the phrase law of your state is not ambiguous and takes its ordinary meaning: valid state law.  Second, California case lawthat under general contract principles, references to California law incorporate the California Legislatures power to change the law retroactively, Doe v. Harris, 57 Cal. 4th 64, 6970, 302 P.3d 598, 601602clarifies any doubt about how to interpret it.  Third, because the court nowhere suggests that California courts would reach the same interpretation in any other context, its conclusion appears to reflect the subject matter, rather than a general principle that would include state statutes invalidated by other federal law.  Fourth, the language the court uses to frame the issue focuses only on arbitration.  Fifth, the view that state law retains independent force after being authoritatively invalidated is one courts are unlikely to apply in other contexts.  Sixth, none of the principles of contract interpretation relied on by the California court suggests that other California courts would reach the same interpretation elsewhere.  The court applied the canon that contracts are construed against the drafter, but the lack of any similar case interpreting similar language to include invalid laws indicates that the antidrafter canon would not lead California courts to reach a similar conclusion in cases not involving arbitration.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
SHAPIRO etal. v. McMANUS, CHAIRMAN, MARYLAND STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 14990.Argued November 4, 2015Decided December 8, 2015
Since 1976, federal law has mandated that a district court of three judges shall be convened ... when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts ...,

28 U.S.C. 2284(a), and has provided that the judge [presented with a request for a three-judge court] shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges to serve, 2284(b)(1).
Petitioners requested that a three-judge court be convened to consider their claim that Marylands 2011 congressional redistricting plan burdens their
 
First Amendment right of political association.  Concluding that no relief could be granted for this claim, the District Judge dismissed the action instead of notifying the Chief Judge of the Circuit to convene a three-judge court.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Section 2284 entitles petitioners to make their case before a three-judge court.  Pp.38.
(a)Section 2284(a)s prescription could not be clearer.  Because the present suit is indisputably an action ... challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts, the District Judge was required to refer the case to a three-judge court.  Section 2284(a) admits of no exception, and the mandatory shall ... normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.  Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach,

523 U.S. 26
.  The subsequent provision of 2284(b)(1), that the district judge shall commence the process for appointment of a three-judge panel unless he determines that three judges are not required, should be read not as a grant of discretion to the district judge to ignore 2284(a), but as a compatible administrative detail requiring district judges to determin[e] only whether the request for three judges is made in a case covered by 2284(a).  This conclusion is bolstered by 2284(b)(3)s explicit command that [a] single judge shall not ... enter judgment on the merits.  Pp.35.
(b)Respondents alternative argument, that the District Judge should have dismissed petitioners claim as constitutionally insubstantial under Goosby v. Osser,

409 U.S. 512
, is unpersuasive.  This Court has long distinguished between failing to raise a substantial federal question for jurisdictional purposeswhat Goosby addressedand failing to state a claim for relief on the meritswhat the District Judge found here; only wholly insubstantial and frivolous claims implicate the former, Bell v. Hood,

327 U.S. 678
683.  Absent such obvious frivolity, the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.  Id., at 682.  Petitioners plea for relief, which was based on a legal theory put forward in Justice Kennedys concurrence in Vieth v. Jubelirer,

541 U.S. 267
, and uncontradicted in subsequent majority opinions, easily clears Goosbys low bar.  Pp.57.

No. 14990.Argued November 4, 2015Decided December 8, 2015
Since 1976, federal law has mandated that a district court of three judges shall be convened ... when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts ...,

28 U.S.C. 2284(a), and has provided that the judge [presented with a request for a three-judge court] shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges to serve, 2284(b)(1).
Petitioners requested that a three-judge court be convened to consider their claim that Marylands 2011 congressional redistricting plan burdens their
 
First Amendment right of political association.  Concluding that no relief could be granted for this claim, the District Judge dismissed the action instead of notifying the Chief Judge of the Circuit to convene a three-judge court.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Section 2284 entitles petitioners to make their case before a three-judge court.  Pp.38.
(a)Section 2284(a)s prescription could not be clearer.  Because the present suit is indisputably an action ... challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts, the District Judge was required to refer the case to a three-judge court.  Section 2284(a) admits of no exception, and the mandatory shall ... normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.  Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach,

523 U.S. 26
.  The subsequent provision of 2284(b)(1), that the district judge shall commence the process for appointment of a three-judge panel unless he determines that three judges are not required, should be read not as a grant of discretion to the district judge to ignore 2284(a), but as a compatible administrative detail requiring district judges to determin[e] only whether the request for three judges is made in a case covered by 2284(a).  This conclusion is bolstered by 2284(b)(3)s explicit command that [a] single judge shall not ... enter judgment on the merits.  Pp.35.
(b)Respondents alternative argument, that the District Judge should have dismissed petitioners claim as constitutionally insubstantial under Goosby v. Osser,

409 U.S. 512
, is unpersuasive.  This Court has long distinguished between failing to raise a substantial federal question for jurisdictional purposeswhat Goosby addressedand failing to state a claim for relief on the meritswhat the District Judge found here; only wholly insubstantial and frivolous claims implicate the former, Bell v. Hood,

327 U.S. 678
683.  Absent such obvious frivolity, the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.  Id., at 682.  Petitioners plea for relief, which was based on a legal theory put forward in Justice Kennedys concurrence in Vieth v. Jubelirer,

541 U.S. 267
, and uncontradicted in subsequent majority opinions, easily clears Goosbys low bar.  Pp.57.
584 Fed. Appx. 140, reversed and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."|"
			Petitioners, a bipartisan group of citizens, requested that a three-judge court be convened to consider their claim that Marylands 2011 congressional redistricting plan burdens their First Amendment right of political association. The district court dismissed the action, concluding that no relief could be granted. The Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Court held that 28 U.S.C. 2284 entitles petitioners to make their case before a three-judge court because, under section 2284(a), the present suit is indisputably an action challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts. The Court further held that the subsequent provision of section 2284(b)(1), that the district judge shall commence the process for appointment of a three-judge panel unless he determines that three judges are not required, should be read not as a grant of discretion to the district judge to ignore section 2284(a), but as a compatible administrative detail. The Court went on to say that this conclusion is bolstered by section 2284(b)(3)s explicit command that [a] single judge shall not . . . enter judgment on the merits. Finally, the Court held that respondents' alternative argument, that the District Judge should have dismissed petitioners' claim as ""constitutionally insubstantial"" under Goosby v. Osser, is unpersuasive. Accordingly, the Court reversed and remanded.

OBB PERSONENVERKEHR AG v. SACHS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131067.Argued October 5, 2015Decided December 1, 2015
Respondent Carol Sachs, a California resident, purchased a Eurail pass over the Internet from a Massachusetts-based travel agent.  While using that pass to board a train in Austria operated by petitioner OBB Personenverkehr AG (OBB), the Austrian state-owned railway, Sachs fell to the tracks and suffered traumatic personal injuries.  She sued OBB in Federal District Court.  OBB moved to dismiss, claiming that her suit was barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which shields foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities from suit in United States courts, unless a specified exception applies.  Sachs countered that her suit fell within the Acts commercial activity exception, which abrogates sovereign immunity for suits based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by [a] foreign state,

28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2), reasoning that her suit was based upon the Massachusetts-based travel agents sale of the Eurail pass in the United States, and that the travel agents sale of that pass could be attributed to OBB through common law principles of agency.  The District Court held that Sachss suit did not fall within 1605(a)(2) and dismissed the suit, but the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court first concluded that the Eurail pass sale by the travel agent could be attributed to OBB through common law principles of agency, and then determined that Sachss suit was based upon that Eurail pass sale because the sale established a single element necessary to recover under each cause of action brought by Sachs.
Held: Sachss suit falls outside the commercial activity exception and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity.  Pp.511.
(a) Sachss suit is not based upon the sale of the Eurail pass for purposes of 1605(a)(2).  Therefore, the Court has no need to address whether the Act allows the travel agents sale of the Eurail pass to be attributed to OBB through common law principles of agency.  Pp.59.
(1) Although the Act does not elaborate on the phrase based upon, Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,

507 U.S. 349
, provides sufficient guidance to resolve this case.  There, the Court held that the based upon inquiry requires a court to determine the particular conduct on which the action is based, id., at 356, and identified that conduct by looking to the gravamen of the complaint, id., at 357.  Pp.56.
(2) The Ninth Circuit used a flawed approach when it found that the based upon inquiry would be satisfied if the sale of the Eurail pass provided an element of each of Sachss claims.  This Courts approach in Nelson is flatly incompatible with such a one-element approach, which necessarily requires a court to identify all the elements of each claim before finding that the claim falls outside 1605(a)(2).  The Nelson Court did not undertake such an exhaustive claim-by-claim, element-by-element analysis or engage in the choice-of-law analysis necessary to such an undertaking.  See id., at 356358.  P.7.
(3) As opposed to adopting a one-element test, the Nelson Court zeroed in on the core of the plaintiffs suitthe conduct that actually injured the plaintiffsto identify the conduct that the suit was based upon.  See id., at 358.  All of Sachss claims turn on the same tragic episode in Austria, allegedly caused by wrongful conduct and dangerous conditions in Austria, which led to injuries suffered in Austria.  However Sachs frames her suit, the incident in Innsbruck, Austria, remains at its foundation.  Any other approach would allow plaintiffs to evade the Acts restrictions through artful pleading.  See id., at 363.  Pp.79.
(b) Sachs now contends that her claims are based upon OBBs entire railway enterprise.  Because that argument was never presented to any lower court, it is forfeited.  See Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz,

			Respondent, a California resident, filed suit against OBB, an Austrian state-owned railway, after she suffered injuries from falling off the railroad tracks at the Innsbruck, Austria, train station. Respondent had purchased a Eurail pass over the Internet from a Massachusetts-based travel agent.

14-1143|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CHADRIN LEE MULLENIX v. BEATRICE LUNA, individually and as representative of theESTATE OF ISRAEL LEIJA, JR., etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 141143.Decided November 9, 2015
Per Curiam.
On the night of March 23, 2010, Sergeant Randy Baker of the Tulia, Texas Police Department followed Israel Leija, Jr., to a drive-in restaurant, with a warrant for his arrest.  773 F. 3d 712, 715716 (CA5 2014).  When Baker approached Leijas car and informed him that he was under arrest, Leija sped off, headed for Interstate 27.  2013 WL 4017124, *1 (ND Tex., Aug. 7, 2013).  Baker gave chase and was quickly joined by Trooper Gabriel Rodriguez of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).  773 F.3d, at 716.
Leija entered the interstate and led the officers on an 18-minute chase at speeds between 85 and 110 miles per hour.  Ibid.  Twice during the chase, Leija called the Tulia Police dispatcher, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot at police officers if they did not abandon their pursuit.  The dispatcher relayed Leijas threats, together with a report that Leija might be intoxicated, to all concerned officers.
As Baker and Rodriguez maintained their pursuit, other law enforcement officers set up tire spikes at three locations.  Officer Troy Ducheneaux of the Canyon Police Department manned the spike strip at the first location Leija was expected to reach, beneath the overpass at Cemetery Road.  Ducheneaux and the other officers had received training on the deployment of spike strips, including on how to take a defensive position so as to minimize the risk posed by the passing driver.  Ibid.
DPS Trooper Chadrin Mullenix also responded.  He drove to the Cemetery Road overpass, initially intending to set up a spike strip there.  Upon learning of the other spike strip positions, however, Mullenix began to consider another tactic: shooting at Leijas car in order to disable it.  2013 WL 4017124, *1.  Mullenix had not received training in this tactic and had not attempted it before, but he radioed the idea to Rodriguez.  Rodriguez responded 104, gave Mullenix his position, and said that Leija had slowed to 85 miles per hour.  Mullenix then asked the DPS dispatcher to inform his supervisor, Sergeant Byrd, of his plan and ask if Byrd thought it was worth doing.  773 F.3d, at 716717.  Before receiving Byrds response, Mullenix exited his vehicle and, armed with his service rifle, took a shooting position on the overpass, 20 feet above I27.  Respondents allege that from this position, Mullenix still could hear Byrds response to stand by and see if the spikes work first.  Ibid.[1]*
As Mullenix waited for Leija to arrive, he and another officer, Randall County Sheriffs Deputy Tom Shipman, discussed whether Mullenixs plan would work and how and where to shoot the vehicle to best carry it out.  2013 WL 4017124, *2.  Shipman also informed Mullenix that another officer was located beneath the overpass.  773 F.3d, at 717.
Approximately three minutes after Mullenix took up his shooting position, he spotted Leijas vehicle, with Rodriguez in pursuit.  As Leija approached the overpass, Mullenix fired six shots.  Leijas car continued forward beneath the overpass, where it engaged the spike strip, hit the median, and rolled two and a half times.  It was later determined that Leija had been killed by Mullenixs shots, four of which struck his upper body.  There was no evidence that any of Mullenixs shots hit the cars radiator, hood, or engine block.  Id., at 716717; 2013 WL 4017124, *2*3.
Respondents sued Mullenix under Rev. Stat. 1979,

42 U. S. C. 1983, alleging that he had violated the
 
Fourth Amendment by using excessive force against Leija.  Mullenix moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity, but the District Court denied his motion, finding that [t]here are genuine issues of fact as to whether Trooper Mullenix acted recklessly, or acted as a reasonable, trained peace officer would have acted in the same or similar circumstances.  2013 WL 4017124, *6.
Mullenix appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  765 F. 3d 531 (2014).  The court agreed with the District Court that the immediacy of the risk posed by Leija is a disputed fact that a reasonable jury could find either in the plaintiffs favor or in the officers favor, precluding us from concluding that Mullenix acted objectively reasonably as a matter of law.  Id., at 538.
Judge King dissented.  She described the fact issue referenced by the majority as simply a restatement of the objective reasonableness test that applies to
 
Fourth Amendment excessive force claims, which, she noted, the Supreme Court has held is a pure question of law.  Id., at 544545 (quoting Scott v. Harris,

550 U. S. 372,
381, n.
8 (2007)
).  Turning to that legal question, Judge King concluded that Mullenixs actions were objectively reasonable.  When Mullenix fired, she emphasized, he knew not only that Leija had threatened to shoot the officers involved in his pursuit, but also that Leija was seconds away from encountering such an officer beneath the overpass.  Judge King also dismissed the notion that Mullenix should have given the spike strips a chance to work.  She explained that because spike strips are often ineffective, and because officers operating them are vulnerable to gunfire from passing cars, Mullenix reasonably feared that the officers manning them faced a significant risk of harm.  765 F.3d, at 548549.
Mullenix sought rehearing en banc before the Fifth Circuit, but the court denied his petition.  Judge Jolly dissented, joined by six other members of the court.  Judge King, who joined Judge Jollys dissent, also filed a separate dissent of her own.  777 F. 3d 221 (2014) (per curiam).  On the same day, however, the two members forming the original panels majority withdrew their previous opinion and substituted a new one.  773 F.3d 712.  The revised opinion recognized that objective unreasonableness is a question of law that can be resolved on summary judgmentas Judge King had explained in her dissentbut reaffirmed the denial of qualified immunity.  Id., at 715, 718.  The majority concluded that Mullenixs actions were objectively unreasonable because several of the factors that had justified deadly force in previous cases were absent here: There were no innocent bystanders, Leijas driving was relatively controlled, Mullenix had not first given the spike strips a chance to work, and Mullenixs decision was not a split-second judgment.  Id., at 720724.  The court went on to conclude that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity because the law was clearly established such that a reasonable officer would have known that the use of deadly force, absent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 725.
We address only the qualified immunity question, not whether there was a
 
Fourth Amendment violation in the first place, and now reverse.
The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pearson v. Callahan,

555 U.S. 223,
231 (2009)
 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald,

457 U.S. 800,
818 (1982)
).  A clearly established right is one that is sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.  Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,

563 U.S. 731,
741 (2011)
.  Put simply, qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Malley v. Briggs,

475 U.S. 335,
341 (1986)
.
 We have repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.  al-Kidd, supra, at 742.  The dispositive question is whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  This inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.  Brosseau v. Haugen,

543 U. S. 194,
198 (2004)
 (per curiam) (quoting Saucier v. Katz,

533 U. S. 194,
201 (2001)
).  Such specificity is especially important in the
 
Fourth Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that [i]t is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.  533 U.S., at 205.
In this case, the Fifth Circuit held that Mullenix violated the clearly established rule that a police officer may not use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.  773 F.3d, at 725.  Yet this Court has previously consideredand rejectedalmost that exact formulation of the qualified immunity question in the
 
Fourth Amendment context.  In Brosseau, which also involved the shooting of a suspect fleeing by car, the Ninth Circuit denied qualified immu-nity on the ground that the officer had violated the clearly established rule, set forth in Tennessee v. Garner,

471 U.S. 1 (1985)
, that deadly force is only permissible where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.  Haugen v. Brosseau, 339 F. 3d 857, 873 (CA9 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court summarily reversed, holding that use of Gar-ners general test for excessive force was mistaken.  Brosseau, 543 U.S., at 199.  The correct inquiry, the Court explained, was whether it was clearly established that the
 
Fourth Amendment prohibited the officers conduct in the situation [she] confronted: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.  Id., at 199200.  The Court considered three court of appeals cases discussed by the parties, noted that this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case, and concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because [n]one of [the cases] squarely governs the case here.  Id., at 201 (emphasis added).
Anderson v. Creighton,

483 U. S. 635 (1987)
, is also instructive on the required degree of specificity.  There, the lower court had denied qualified immunity based on the clearly established right to be free from warrantless searches of ones home unless the searching officers have probable cause and there are exigent circumstances.  Id., at 640.  This Court faulted that formulation for failing to address the actual question at issue: whether the circumstances with which Anderson was confronted ... constitute[d] probable cause and exigent circumstances.  Id., at 640641.  Without answering that question, the Court explained, the conclusion that Andersons search was objectively unreasonable did not follow immediately fromand thus was not clearly established bythe principle that warrantless searches not supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances violate the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 641.
In this case, Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxi-cated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer at Cemetery Road.  The relevant inquiry is whether existing precedent placed the conclusion that Mullenix acted unreasonably in these circumstances beyond debate.  al-Kidd, supra, at 741.  The general principle that deadly force requires a sufficient threat hardly settles this matter.  See Pasco v. Knoblauch, 566 F.3d 572, 580 (CA5 2009) ([I]t would be unreasonable to expect a police officer to make the numerous legal conclusions necessary to apply Garner to a high-speed car chase ...).
Far from clarifying the issue, excessive force cases involving car chases reveal the hazy legal backdrop against which Mullenix acted.  In Brosseau itself, the Court held that an officer did not violate clearly established law when she shot a fleeing suspect out of fear that he endangered other officers on foot who [she] believed were in the immediate area, the occupied vehicles in [his] path, and any other citizens who might be in the area.  543 U.S., at 197 (first alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  The threat Leija posed was at least as immediate as that presented by a suspect who had just begun to drive off and was headed only in the general direction of officers and bystanders.  Id., at 196197.  By the time Mullenix fired, Leija had led police on a 25-mile chase at extremely high speeds, was reportedly intoxicated, had twice threatened to shoot officers, and was racing towards an officers location.
This Court has considered excessive force claims in connection with high-speed chases on only two occasions since Brosseau.  In Scott v. Harris,

550 U.S. 372
, the Court held that an officer did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment by ramming the car of a fugitive whose reckless driving posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the chase.  Id., at 384.  And in Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), the Court reaffirmed Scott by holding that an officer acted reasonably when he fatally shot a fugitive who was intent on resuming a chase that pose[d] a deadly threat for others on the road.  572 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Court has thus never found the use of deadly force in connection with a dangerous car chase to violate the
 
Fourth Amendment, let alone to be a basis for denying qualified immunity.  Leija in his flight did not pass as many cars as the drivers in Scott or Plumhoff; traffic was light on I27.  At the same time, the fleeing fugitives in Scott and Plumhoff had not verbally threatened to kill any officers in their path, nor were they about to come upon such officers.  In any event, none of our precedents squarely governs the facts here.  Given Leijas conduct, we cannot say that only someone plainly incompetent or who knowingly violate[s] the law would have perceived a sufficient threat and acted as Mullenix did.  Malley, 475 U.S., at 341.
The dissent focuses on the availability of spike strips as an alternative means of terminating the chase.  It argues that even if Leija posed a threat sufficient to justify deadly force in some circumstances, Mullenix nevertheless contravened clearly established law because he did not wait to see if the spike strips would work before taking action.  Spike strips, however, present dangers of their own, not only to drivers who encounter them at speeds between 85 and 110 miles per hour, but also to officers manning them.  See, e.g., Thompson v. Mercer, 762 F.3d 433, 440 (CA5 2014); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 1516.  Nor are spike strips always successful in ending the chase.  See, e.g., Cordova v. Aragon, 569 F.3d 1183, 1186 (CA10 2009); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 16 (citing examples).  The dissent can cite no case from this Court denying qualified immunity because officers entitled to terminate a high-speed chase selected one dangerous alternative over another.
Even so, the dissent argues, there was no governmental interest that justified acting before Leijas car hit the spikes.  Mullenix explained, however, that he feared Leija might attempt to shoot at or run over the officers manning the spike strips.  Mullenix also feared that even if Leija hit the spike strips, he might still be able to continue driving in the direction of other officers.  The dissent ignores these interests by suggesting that there was no possible marginal gain in shooting at the car over using the spike strips already in place.  Post, at 4 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  In fact, Mullenix hoped his actions would stop the car in a manner that avoided the risks to other officers and other drivers that relying on spike strips would entail.  The dissent disputes the merits of the options available to Mullenix, post, at 34, but others with more experience analyze the issues differently.  See, e.g., Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 1516. Ultimately, whatever can be said of the wisdom of Mullenixs choice, this Courts precedents do not place the conclusion that he acted unreasonably in these circumstances beyond debate.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at 741.
More fundamentally, the dissent repeats the Fifth Circuits error.  It defines the qualified immunity inquiry at a high level of generalitywhether any governmental interest justified choosing one tactic over anotherand then fails to consider that question in the specific context of the case.  Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S., at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As in Anderson, the conclusion that Mullenixs reasons were insufficient to justify his actions simply does not follow immediately from the general proposition that force must be justified.  483 U.S., at 641.
Cases decided by the lower courts since Brosseau likewise have not clearly established that deadly force is inappropriate in response to conduct like Leijas.  The Fifth Circuit here principally relied on its own decision in Lytle v. Bexar County, 560 F. 3d 404 (2009), denying qualified immunity to a police officer who had fired at a fleeing car and killed one of its passengers.  That holding turned on the courts assumption, for purposes of summary judgment, that the car was moving away from the officer and had already traveled some distance at the moment the officer fired.  See id., at 409.  The court held that a reasonable jury could conclude that a receding car did not pose a sufficient threat of harm such that the use of deadly force was reasonable.  Id., at 416.  But, crucially, the court also recognized that if the facts were as the officer alleged, and he fired as the car was coming towards him, he would likely be entitled to qualified immunity based on the threat of immediate and severe physical harm.  Id., at 412.  Without implying that Lytle was either correct or incorrect, it suffices to say that Lytle does not clearly dictate the conclusion that Mullenix was unjustified in perceiving grave danger and responding accordingly, given that Leija was speeding towards a confrontation with officers he had threatened to kill.
Cases that the Fifth Circuit ignored also suggest that Mullenixs assessment of the threat Leija posed was reasonable.  In Long v. Slaton, 508 F. 3d 576 (2007), for example, the Eleventh Circuit held that a sheriffs deputy did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment by fatally shooting a mentally unstable individual who was attempting to flee in the deputys car, even though at the time of the shooting the individual had not yet operated the cruiser dangerously.  The court explained that the law does not require officers in a tense and dangerous situation to wait until the moment a suspect uses a deadly weapon to act to stop the suspect and concluded that the deputy had reason to believe Long was dangerous based on his unstable state of mind, theft of the cruiser, and failure to heed the deputys warning to stop.  Id., at 581582.  The court also rejected the notion that the deputy should have first tried less lethal methods, such as spike strips.  [C]onsidering the unpredictability of Longs behavior and his fleeing in a marked police cruiser, the court held, we think the police need not have taken that chance and hoped for the best.  Id., at 583 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  But see Smith v. Cupp, 430 F.3d 766, 774777 (CA6 2005) (denying qualified immunity to an officer who shot an intoxicated suspect who had stolen the officers cruiser where a reasonable jury could have concluded that the suspects flight did not immediately threaten the officer or any other bystander).
Other cases cited by the Fifth Circuit and respondents are simply too factually distinct to speak clearly to the specific circumstances here.  Several involve suspects who may have done little more than flee at relatively low speeds.  See, e.g., Walker v. Davis, 649 F. 3d 502, 503 (CA6 2011); Kirby v. Duva, 530 F. 3d 475, 479480 (CA6 2008); Adams v. Speers, 473 F. 3d 989, 991 (CA9 2007); Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323, 13301331, and n. 7 (CA11 2003).  These cases shed little light on whether the far greater danger of a speeding fugitive threatening to kill police officers waiting in his path could warrant deadly force.  The court below noted that no weapon was ever seen, 773 F.3d, at 723, but surely in these circumstances the police were justified in taking Leija at his word when he twice told the dispatcher he had a gun and was prepared to use it.
Finally, respondents argue that the danger Leija represented was less substantial than the threats that courts have found sufficient to justify deadly force.  But the mere fact that courts have approved deadly force in more extreme circumstances says little, if anything, about whether such force was reasonable in the circumstances here.  The fact is that when Mullenix fired, he reasonably understood Leija to be a fugitive fleeing arrest, at speeds over 100 miles per hour, who was armed and possibly intoxicated, who had threatened to kill any officer he saw if the police did not abandon their pursuit, and who was racing towards Officer Ducheneauxs position.  Even accepting that these circumstances fall somewhere between the two sets of cases respondents discuss, qualified immunity protects actions in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.  Brosseau, supra, at 201 (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S., at 206; some internal quotation marks omitted).
Because the constitutional rule applied by the Fifth Circuit was not beyond debate, Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8), we grant Mullenixs petition for certiorari and reverse the Fifth Circuits determination that Mullenix is not entitled to qualified immunity.
It is so ordered.

			"|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CHADRIN LEE MULLENIX v. BEATRICE LUNA, individually and as representative of theESTATE OF ISRAEL LEIJA, JR., etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 141143.Decided November 9, 2015
Per Curiam.
On the night of March 23, 2010, Sergeant Randy Baker of the Tulia, Texas Police Department followed Israel Leija, Jr., to a drive-in restaurant, with a warrant for his arrest.  773 F. 3d 712, 715716 (CA5 2014).  When Baker approached Leijas car and informed him that he was under arrest, Leija sped off, headed for Interstate 27.  2013 WL 4017124, *1 (ND Tex., Aug. 7, 2013).  Baker gave chase and was quickly joined by Trooper Gabriel Rodriguez of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).  773 F.3d, at 716.
Leija entered the interstate and led the officers on an 18-minute chase at speeds between 85 and 110 miles per hour.  Ibid.  Twice during the chase, Leija called the Tulia Police dispatcher, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot at police officers if they did not abandon their pursuit.  The dispatcher relayed Leijas threats, together with a report that Leija might be intoxicated, to all concerned officers.
As Baker and Rodriguez maintained their pursuit, other law enforcement officers set up tire spikes at three locations.  Officer Troy Ducheneaux of the Canyon Police Department manned the spike strip at the first location Leija was expected to reach, beneath the overpass at Cemetery Road.  Ducheneaux and the other officers had received training on the deployment of spike strips, including on how to take a defensive position so as to minimize the risk posed by the passing driver.  Ibid.
DPS Trooper Chadrin Mullenix also responded.  He drove to the Cemetery Road overpass, initially intending to set up a spike strip there.  Upon learning of the other spike strip positions, however, Mullenix began to consider another tactic: shooting at Leijas car in order to disable it.  2013 WL 4017124, *1.  Mullenix had not received training in this tactic and had not attempted it before, but he radioed the idea to Rodriguez.  Rodriguez responded 104, gave Mullenix his position, and said that Leija had slowed to 85 miles per hour.  Mullenix then asked the DPS dispatcher to inform his supervisor, Sergeant Byrd, of his plan and ask if Byrd thought it was worth doing.  773 F.3d, at 716717.  Before receiving Byrds response, Mullenix exited his vehicle and, armed with his service rifle, took a shooting position on the overpass, 20 feet above I27.  Respondents allege that from this position, Mullenix still could hear Byrds response to stand by and see if the spikes work first.  Ibid.[1]*
As Mullenix waited for Leija to arrive, he and another officer, Randall County Sheriffs Deputy Tom Shipman, discussed whether Mullenixs plan would work and how and where to shoot the vehicle to best carry it out.  2013 WL 4017124, *2.  Shipman also informed Mullenix that another officer was located beneath the overpass.  773 F.3d, at 717.
Approximately three minutes after Mullenix took up his shooting position, he spotted Leijas vehicle, with Rodriguez in pursuit.  As Leija approached the overpass, Mullenix fired six shots.  Leijas car continued forward beneath the overpass, where it engaged the spike strip, hit the median, and rolled two and a half times.  It was later determined that Leija had been killed by Mullenixs shots, four of which struck his upper body.  There was no evidence that any of Mullenixs shots hit the cars radiator, hood, or engine block.  Id., at 716717; 2013 WL 4017124, *2*3.
Respondents sued Mullenix under Rev. Stat. 1979,

42 U. S. C. 1983, alleging that he had violated the
 
Fourth Amendment by using excessive force against Leija.  Mullenix moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity, but the District Court denied his motion, finding that [t]here are genuine issues of fact as to whether Trooper Mullenix acted recklessly, or acted as a reasonable, trained peace officer would have acted in the same or similar circumstances.  2013 WL 4017124, *6.
Mullenix appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  765 F. 3d 531 (2014).  The court agreed with the District Court that the immediacy of the risk posed by Leija is a disputed fact that a reasonable jury could find either in the plaintiffs favor or in the officers favor, precluding us from concluding that Mullenix acted objectively reasonably as a matter of law.  Id., at 538.
Judge King dissented.  She described the fact issue referenced by the majority as simply a restatement of the objective reasonableness test that applies to
 
Fourth Amendment excessive force claims, which, she noted, the Supreme Court has held is a pure question of law.  Id., at 544545 (quoting Scott v. Harris,

550 U. S. 372,
381, n.
8 (2007)
).  Turning to that legal question, Judge King concluded that Mullenixs actions were objectively reasonable.  When Mullenix fired, she emphasized, he knew not only that Leija had threatened to shoot the officers involved in his pursuit, but also that Leija was seconds away from encountering such an officer beneath the overpass.  Judge King also dismissed the notion that Mullenix should have given the spike strips a chance to work.  She explained that because spike strips are often ineffective, and because officers operating them are vulnerable to gunfire from passing cars, Mullenix reasonably feared that the officers manning them faced a significant risk of harm.  765 F.3d, at 548549.
Mullenix sought rehearing en banc before the Fifth Circuit, but the court denied his petition.  Judge Jolly dissented, joined by six other members of the court.  Judge King, who joined Judge Jollys dissent, also filed a separate dissent of her own.  777 F. 3d 221 (2014) (per curiam).  On the same day, however, the two members forming the original panels majority withdrew their previous opinion and substituted a new one.  773 F.3d 712.  The revised opinion recognized that objective unreasonableness is a question of law that can be resolved on summary judgmentas Judge King had explained in her dissentbut reaffirmed the denial of qualified immunity.  Id., at 715, 718.  The majority concluded that Mullenixs actions were objectively unreasonable because several of the factors that had justified deadly force in previous cases were absent here: There were no innocent bystanders, Leijas driving was relatively controlled, Mullenix had not first given the spike strips a chance to work, and Mullenixs decision was not a split-second judgment.  Id., at 720724.  The court went on to conclude that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity because the law was clearly established such that a reasonable officer would have known that the use of deadly force, absent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 725.
We address only the qualified immunity question, not whether there was a
 
Fourth Amendment violation in the first place, and now reverse.
The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pearson v. Callahan,

555 U.S. 223,
231 (2009)
 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald,

457 U.S. 800,
818 (1982)
).  A clearly established right is one that is sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.  Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,

563 U.S. 731,
741 (2011)
.  Put simply, qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Malley v. Briggs,

475 U.S. 335,
341 (1986)
.
 We have repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.  al-Kidd, supra, at 742.  The dispositive question is whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  This inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.  Brosseau v. Haugen,

543 U. S. 194,
198 (2004)
 (per curiam) (quoting Saucier v. Katz,

533 U. S. 194,
201 (2001)
).  Such specificity is especially important in the
 
Fourth Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that [i]t is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.  533 U.S., at 205.
In this case, the Fifth Circuit held that Mullenix violated the clearly established rule that a police officer may not use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.  773 F.3d, at 725.  Yet this Court has previously consideredand rejectedalmost that exact formulation of the qualified immunity question in the
 
Fourth Amendment context.  In Brosseau, which also involved the shooting of a suspect fleeing by car, the Ninth Circuit denied qualified immu-nity on the ground that the officer had violated the clearly established rule, set forth in Tennessee v. Garner,

471 U.S. 1 (1985)
, that deadly force is only permissible where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.  Haugen v. Brosseau, 339 F. 3d 857, 873 (CA9 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court summarily reversed, holding that use of Gar-ners general test for excessive force was mistaken.  Brosseau, 543 U.S., at 199.  The correct inquiry, the Court explained, was whether it was clearly established that the
 
Fourth Amendment prohibited the officers conduct in the situation [she] confronted: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.  Id., at 199200.  The Court considered three court of appeals cases discussed by the parties, noted that this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case, and concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because [n]one of [the cases] squarely governs the case here.  Id., at 201 (emphasis added).
Anderson v. Creighton,

483 U. S. 635 (1987)
, is also instructive on the required degree of specificity.  There, the lower court had denied qualified immunity based on the clearly established right to be free from warrantless searches of ones home unless the searching officers have probable cause and there are exigent circumstances.  Id., at 640.  This Court faulted that formulation for failing to address the actual question at issue: whether the circumstances with which Anderson was confronted ... constitute[d] probable cause and exigent circumstances.  Id., at 640641.  Without answering that question, the Court explained, the conclusion that Andersons search was objectively unreasonable did not follow immediately fromand thus was not clearly established bythe principle that warrantless searches not supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances violate the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 641.
In this case, Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxi-cated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer at Cemetery Road.  The relevant inquiry is whether existing precedent placed the conclusion that Mullenix acted unreasonably in these circumstances beyond debate.  al-Kidd, supra, at 741.  The general principle that deadly force requires a sufficient threat hardly settles this matter.  See Pasco v. Knoblauch, 566 F.3d 572, 580 (CA5 2009) ([I]t would be unreasonable to expect a police officer to make the numerous legal conclusions necessary to apply Garner to a high-speed car chase ...).
Far from clarifying the issue, excessive force cases involving car chases reveal the hazy legal backdrop against which Mullenix acted.  In Brosseau itself, the Court held that an officer did not violate clearly established law when she shot a fleeing suspect out of fear that he endangered other officers on foot who [she] believed were in the immediate area, the occupied vehicles in [his] path, and any other citizens who might be in the area.  543 U.S., at 197 (first alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  The threat Leija posed was at least as immediate as that presented by a suspect who had just begun to drive off and was headed only in the general direction of officers and bystanders.  Id., at 196197.  By the time Mullenix fired, Leija had led police on a 25-mile chase at extremely high speeds, was reportedly intoxicated, had twice threatened to shoot officers, and was racing towards an officers location.
This Court has considered excessive force claims in connection with high-speed chases on only two occasions since Brosseau.  In Scott v. Harris,

550 U.S. 372
, the Court held that an officer did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment by ramming the car of a fugitive whose reckless driving posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the chase.  Id., at 384.  And in Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), the Court reaffirmed Scott by holding that an officer acted reasonably when he fatally shot a fugitive who was intent on resuming a chase that pose[d] a deadly threat for others on the road.  572 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Court has thus never found the use of deadly force in connection with a dangerous car chase to violate the
 
Fourth Amendment, let alone to be a basis for denying qualified immunity.  Leija in his flight did not pass as many cars as the drivers in Scott or Plumhoff; traffic was light on I27.  At the same time, the fleeing fugitives in Scott and Plumhoff had not verbally threatened to kill any officers in their path, nor were they about to come upon such officers.  In any event, none of our precedents squarely governs the facts here.  Given Leijas conduct, we cannot say that only someone plainly incompetent or who knowingly violate[s] the law would have perceived a sufficient threat and acted as Mullenix did.  Malley, 475 U.S., at 341.
The dissent focuses on the availability of spike strips as an alternative means of terminating the chase.  It argues that even if Leija posed a threat sufficient to justify deadly force in some circumstances, Mullenix nevertheless contravened clearly established law because he did not wait to see if the spike strips would work before taking action.  Spike strips, however, present dangers of their own, not only to drivers who encounter them at speeds between 85 and 110 miles per hour, but also to officers manning them.  See, e.g., Thompson v. Mercer, 762 F.3d 433, 440 (CA5 2014); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 1516.  Nor are spike strips always successful in ending the chase.  See, e.g., Cordova v. Aragon, 569 F.3d 1183, 1186 (CA10 2009); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 16 (citing examples).  The dissent can cite no case from this Court denying qualified immunity because officers entitled to terminate a high-speed chase selected one dangerous alternative over another.
Even so, the dissent argues, there was no governmental interest that justified acting before Leijas car hit the spikes.  Mullenix explained, however, that he feared Leija might attempt to shoot at or run over the officers manning the spike strips.  Mullenix also feared that even if Leija hit the spike strips, he might still be able to continue driving in the direction of other officers.  The dissent ignores these interests by suggesting that there was no possible marginal gain in shooting at the car over using the spike strips already in place.  Post, at 4 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  In fact, Mullenix hoped his actions would stop the car in a manner that avoided the risks to other officers and other drivers that relying on spike strips would entail.  The dissent disputes the merits of the options available to Mullenix, post, at 34, but others with more experience analyze the issues differently.  See, e.g., Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae 1516. Ultimately, whatever can be said of the wisdom of Mullenixs choice, this Courts precedents do not place the conclusion that he acted unreasonably in these circumstances beyond debate.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S., at 741.
More fundamentally, the dissent repeats the Fifth Circuits error.  It defines the qualified immunity inquiry at a high level of generalitywhether any governmental interest justified choosing one tactic over anotherand then fails to consider that question in the specific context of the case.  Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S., at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As in Anderson, the conclusion that Mullenixs reasons were insufficient to justify his actions simply does not follow immediately from the general proposition that force must be justified.  483 U.S., at 641.
Cases decided by the lower courts since Brosseau likewise have not clearly established that deadly force is inappropriate in response to conduct like Leijas.  The Fifth Circuit here principally relied on its own decision in Lytle v. Bexar County, 560 F. 3d 404 (2009), denying qualified immunity to a police officer who had fired at a fleeing car and killed one of its passengers.  That holding turned on the courts assumption, for purposes of summary judgment, that the car was moving away from the officer and had already traveled some distance at the moment the officer fired.  See id., at 409.  The court held that a reasonable jury could conclude that a receding car did not pose a sufficient threat of harm such that the use of deadly force was reasonable.  Id., at 416.  But, crucially, the court also recognized that if the facts were as the officer alleged, and he fired as the car was coming towards him, he would likely be entitled to qualified immunity based on the threat of immediate and severe physical harm.  Id., at 412.  Without implying that Lytle was either correct or incorrect, it suffices to say that Lytle does not clearly dictate the conclusion that Mullenix was unjustified in perceiving grave danger and responding accordingly, given that Leija was speeding towards a confrontation with officers he had threatened to kill.
Cases that the Fifth Circuit ignored also suggest that Mullenixs assessment of the threat Leija posed was reasonable.  In Long v. Slaton, 508 F. 3d 576 (2007), for example, the Eleventh Circuit held that a sheriffs deputy did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment by fatally shooting a mentally unstable individual who was attempting to flee in the deputys car, even though at the time of the shooting the individual had not yet operated the cruiser dangerously.  The court explained that the law does not require officers in a tense and dangerous situation to wait until the moment a suspect uses a deadly weapon to act to stop the suspect and concluded that the deputy had reason to believe Long was dangerous based on his unstable state of mind, theft of the cruiser, and failure to heed the deputys warning to stop.  Id., at 581582.  The court also rejected the notion that the deputy should have first tried less lethal methods, such as spike strips.  [C]onsidering the unpredictability of Longs behavior and his fleeing in a marked police cruiser, the court held, we think the police need not have taken that chance and hoped for the best.  Id., at 583 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  But see Smith v. Cupp, 430 F.3d 766, 774777 (CA6 2005) (denying qualified immunity to an officer who shot an intoxicated suspect who had stolen the officers cruiser where a reasonable jury could have concluded that the suspects flight did not immediately threaten the officer or any other bystander).
Other cases cited by the Fifth Circuit and respondents are simply too factually distinct to speak clearly to the specific circumstances here.  Several involve suspects who may have done little more than flee at relatively low speeds.  See, e.g., Walker v. Davis, 649 F. 3d 502, 503 (CA6 2011); Kirby v. Duva, 530 F. 3d 475, 479480 (CA6 2008); Adams v. Speers, 473 F. 3d 989, 991 (CA9 2007); Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F. 3d 1323, 13301331, and n. 7 (CA11 2003).  These cases shed little light on whether the far greater danger of a speeding fugitive threatening to kill police officers waiting in his path could warrant deadly force.  The court below noted that no weapon was ever seen, 773 F.3d, at 723, but surely in these circumstances the police were justified in taking Leija at his word when he twice told the dispatcher he had a gun and was prepared to use it.
Finally, respondents argue that the danger Leija represented was less substantial than the threats that courts have found sufficient to justify deadly force.  But the mere fact that courts have approved deadly force in more extreme circumstances says little, if anything, about whether such force was reasonable in the circumstances here.  The fact is that when Mullenix fired, he reasonably understood Leija to be a fugitive fleeing arrest, at speeds over 100 miles per hour, who was armed and possibly intoxicated, who had threatened to kill any officer he saw if the police did not abandon their pursuit, and who was racing towards Officer Ducheneauxs position.  Even accepting that these circumstances fall somewhere between the two sets of cases respondents discuss, qualified immunity protects actions in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.  Brosseau, supra, at 201 (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S., at 206; some internal quotation marks omitted).
Because the constitutional rule applied by the Fifth Circuit was not beyond debate, Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8), we grant Mullenixs petition for certiorari and reverse the Fifth Circuits determination that Mullenix is not entitled to qualified immunity.
It is so ordered."|"
			Sergeant Baker, with a warrant, approached Leijas car at a restaurant and stated that he was under arrest. Leija sped onto I-27.  Leija led Baker and Texas Trooper Rodriguez on an 18-minute chase at 85-110 mph. Leija twice called dispatch, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot the officers. The dispatcher broadcast Leijas threats and a report that Leija might be intoxicated. Officer Ducheneaux, who was trained in using tire spike strips, manned a spike strip beneath an overpass. Trooper Mullenix drove to that overpass, where he radioed a plan to shoot and disable the car. Rodriguez responded 10 4. Mullenix asked the dispatcher to inform his supervisor, Byrd, of his plan Before receiving a response, Mullenix took a shooting position.  Byrd responded to see if the spikes work first.  Whether Mullenix heard the response is disputed. Deputy Shipman informed Mullenix that another officer was beneath the overpass.  Approximately three minutes after Mullenix took his position, he spotted Leijas vehicle and fired six shots. Leijas car engaged the spikes, hit the median, and rolled.  Leija was killed by Mullenixs shots. Apparently, no shots hit the radiator, hood, or engine block. Leijas estate sued Mullenix under 42 U. S. C. 1983. Mullenix unsuccessfully sought summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, finding that immediacy of risk was a disputed fact. The Supreme Court reversed on the qualified immunity question, declining to address whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation. Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxicated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer; whatever the wisdom of Mullenixs choice, Supreme Court precedents do not indicate that he beyond debate acted unreasonably.

14-848|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MARYLAND, PETITIONER v. JAMES KULBICKI
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland
No. 14848.Decided October 5, 2015

Per Curiam.
A criminal defendant shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.  U.S. Const., Amdt. 6.  We have held that this right requires effective counsel in both state and federal prosecutions, even if the defendant is unable to afford counsel.  Gideon v. Wainwright,

372 U.S. 335,
344 (1963)
.  Counsel is unconstitutionally ineffective if his performance is both deficient, meaning his errors are so serious that he no longer functions as counsel, and prejudicial, meaning his errors deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  Strickland v. Washington,

466 U.S. 668,
687 (1984)
.  Applying this standard in name only, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that James Kulbickis defense attorneys were unconstitution-ally ineffective.  We summarily reverse.
In 1993, Kulbicki shot his 22-year-old mistress in the head at pointblank range.  The two had been ensnarled in a paternity suit, and the killing occurred the weekend before a scheduled hearing about unpaid child support.  At Kulbickis trial, commencing in 1995, Agent Ernest Peele of the FBI testified as the States expert on Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis, or CBLA.  In testimony of the sort CBLA experts had provided for decades, Peele testified that the composition of elements in the molten lead of a bullet fragment found in Kulbickis truck matched the composition of lead in a bullet fragment removed from the victims brain; a similarity of the sort one would expect if examining two pieces of the same bullet.  440 Md. 33, 41, 99 A.3d 730, 735 (2014).  He further testified that a bullet taken from Kulbickis gun was not an exac[t] match to the bullet fragments, but was similar enough that the two bullets likely came from the same package.  Id., at 4244, 99 A.3d, at 735736.  After considering this ballistics evidence, additional physical evidence from Kul-bickis truck, and witness testimony, the jury convicted Kul-bicki of first-degree murder.
Kulbicki then filed a petition for postconviction relief, which lingered in state court until 2006 when Kulbicki added a claim that his defense attorneys were ineffective for failing to question the legitimacy of CBLA.  By then, 11 years after his conviction, CBLA had fallen out of favor.  Indeed, Kulbicki supplemented his petition once more in 2006 after the Court of Appeals of Maryland held for the first time that CBLA evidence was not generally accepted by the scientific community and was therefore inadmissible.  See Clemons v. State, 392 Md. 339, 371, 896 A.2d 1059, 1078 (2006).
Kulbicki lost in the lower state courts and appealed to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.  At that point, Kulbicki abandoned his claim of ineffective assistance with respect to the CBLA evidence, but the high court vacated Kulbickis conviction on that ground alone.  Kulbickis coun-sel, according to the court, should have found a report coauthored by Agent Peele in 1991 that presaged the flaws in CBLA evidence.  440 Md., at 40, 99 A.3d, at 734.  One of the many findings of the report was that the composition of lead in some bullets was the same as that of lead in other bullets packaged many months later in a separate box.  Rather than conduct further research to explain the existence of overlapping compositions, the authors speculated that coincidence (or, in one case, the likelihood that separately packaged bullets originated from the same source of lead) caused the overlap.  Id., at 49, 99 A.3d, at 739. The Court of Appeals opined that this lone finding should have caused the reports authors to doubt that bullets produced from different sources of lead would have a unique chemical composition, the faulty assumption that ultimately led the court to reject CBLA evidence 15 years later.  Ibid.; see Clemons, supra, 369370, 896 A.2d, at 1077.  The authors failure to fully explore the variance, the Court of Appeals concluded, was at odds with the scientific method.  440 Md., at 50, 99 A.3d, at 740.
In the Court of Appeals view, any good attorney should have spotted this methodological flaw.  The court held that counsels failure to unearth the report, to identify one of its findings as at odds with the scientific method, and to use this methodological flaw to cast doubt on CBLA during counsels cross-examination of Peele, fell short of prevailing professional norms.  Id., at 5053, 99 A.3d, at 740742.  Concluding that counsels supposed deficiency was prejudicial, the court set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial.  Id., at 56, 99 A.3d, at 743744.
We reverse.  The Court of Appeals offered no support for its conclusion that Kulbickis defense attorneys were constitutionally required to predict the demise of CBLA.  Instead, the court indulged in the natural tendency to speculate as to whether a different trial strategy might have been more successful.  Lockhart v. Fretwell,

506 U.S. 364,
372 (1993)
.  To combat this tendency, we have adopted the rule of contemporary assessment of counsels conduct.  Ibid.  Had the Court of Appeals heeded this rule, it would have judge[d] the reasonableness of counsels challenged conduct . . . viewed as of the time of counsels conduct.  Strickland, supra, at 690.
At the time of Kulbickis trial in 1995, the validity of CBLA was widely accepted, and courts regularly admitted CBLA evidence until 2003.  See United States v. Higgs, 663 F.3d 726, 738 (CA4 2011).  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, even the 1991 report itself did not question the validity of CBLA, concluding that it was a valid and useful forensic tool to match suspect to victim.  440 Md., at 51, n.11, 99 A.3d, at 740, n.11.  Counsel did not perform deficiently by dedicating their time and focus to elements of the defense that did not involve poking methodological holes in a then-uncontroversial mode of ballistics analysis.
That is especially the case here, since there is no reason to believe that a diligent search would even have discovered the supposedly crucial report.  The Court of Appeals offered a single citation in support of its sweeping statement that the report was available to Kulbickis counsel in 1995a Government Printing Office Web page accessed by the Court of Appeals, apparently conducting its own Internet research nearly two decades after the trial.  Id., at 51, and n.12, 99 A.3d, at 741, and n.12; see also Brief in Opposition 14.  The Web page indicates that a compilation of forensic studies that included the report was distributed to various public libraries in 1994.  440 Md., at 51, n.12, 99 A. 3d, at 741, n.12.  But which ones?  And in an era of card catalogues, not a worldwide web, what efforts would counsel have had to expend to find the compilation?  And had they found it, would counsel really have combed through the entire compilation, and have identified the one (of many) findings in one of the reports, the disregard of which counsel would have recognized to be at odds with the scientific method?  And then, would effective counsel really have brought to the attention of the jury a report whose conclusion was that CBLA was a valid investigative technique in cases just like Kulbickis?  Neither the Court of Appeals nor Kulbicki has answers.  Given the uncontroversial nature of CBLA at the time of Kulbickis trial, the effect of the judgment below is to demand that lawyers go looking for a needle in a haystack, even when they have reason to doubt there is any needle there.  Rompilla v. Beard,

545 U.S. 374,
389 (2005)
.  The Court of Appeals demanded something close to perfect advocacyfar more than the reasonable competence the right to counsel guarantees.  Yarborough v. Gentry,

540 U. S. 1,
8 (2003)
 (per curiam).
Kulbickis trial counsel did not provide deficient performance when they failed to uncover the 1991 report andto use the reports so-called methodological flaw against Peele on cross-examination.  (We need not, and so do not, decide whether the supposed error prejudiced Kulbicki.)  The petition for writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Maryland isreversed.
It is so ordered.

ARIZONA STATE LEGISLATURE v. ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION etal.
appeal from the united states district court for the district of arizona
No. 131314.Argued March 2, 2015Decided June 29, 2015
Under Arizonas Constitution, the electorate shares lawmaking authority on equal footing with the Arizona Legislature.  The voters may adopt laws and constitutional amendments by ballot initiative, and they may approve or disapprove, by referendum, measures passed by the Legislature.  Ariz. Const., Art.IV, pt. 1, 1.  Any law which may be enacted by the Legislature ... may be enacted by the people under the Initiative.  Art. XXII, 14.
In 2000, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 106, an initiative aimed at the problem of gerrymandering.  Proposition 106 amended Arizonas Constitution, removing redistricting authority from the Arizona Legislature and vesting it in an independent commission, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC).  After the 2010 census, as after the 2000 census, the AIRC adopted redistricting maps for congressional as well as state legislative districts.  The Arizona Legislature challenged the map the Commission adopted in 2012 for congressional districts, arguing that the AIRC and its map violated the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which provides: The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.  Because Legislature means the States representative assembly, the Arizona Legislature contended, the Clause precludes resort to an independent commission, created by initiative, to accomplish redistricting.  A three-judge District Court held that the Arizona Legislature had standing to sue, but rejected its complaint on the merits.
Held:
1.The Arizona Legislature has standing to bring this suit.  In claiming that Proposition 106 stripped it of its alleged constitutional prerogative to engage in redistricting and that its injury would be remedied by a court order enjoining the propositions enforcement, the Legislature has shown injury that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, fairly traceable to the challenged action, and redressable by a favorable ruling, Clapper v. Amnesty Intl USA, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  Specifically, Proposition 106, together with the Arizona Constitutions ban on efforts by the Arizona Legislature to undermine the purposes of an initiative, would completely nullif[y] any vote by the Legislature, now or in the future, purporting to adopt a redistricting plan.  Raines v. Byrd,521 U.S. 811824.  Pp.915.
2.The Elections Clause and2 U.S.C. 2a(c) permit Arizonas use of a commission to adopt congressional districts.  Pp.1535.
(a)Redistricting is a legislative function to be performed in accordance with the States prescriptions for lawmaking, which may include the referendum, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant,241 U.S. 565, and the Governors veto, Smiley v. Holm,285 U.S. 355.  While exercise of the initiative was not at issue in this Courts prior decisions, there is no constitutional barrier to a States empowerment of its people by embracing that form of lawmaking.  Pp.1519.
(b)Title2 U.S.C. 2a(c)which provides that, [u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment, it must follow federally prescribed redistricting procedurespermits redistricting in accord with Arizonas initiative.  From 1862 through 1901, apportionment Acts required a State to follow federal procedures unless the [state] legislature drew district lines.  In 1911, Congress, recognizing that States had supplemented the representative legislature mode of lawmaking with a direct lawmaking role for the people, replaced the reference to redistricting by the state legislature with a reference to redistricting of a State in the manner provided by the laws thereof.  4,37Stat.14.  The Acts legislative history leaves no ... doubt, Hildebrant, 241 U.S., at 568, that the change was made to safeguard to each state full authority to employ in the creation of congressional districts its own laws and regulations.  47 Cong. Rec. 3437.  If they include the initiative, it is included.  Id., at 3508.  Congress used virtually identical language in enacting 2a(c) in 1941.  This provision also accords full respect to the redistricting procedures adopted by the States.  Thus, so long as a State has redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereofas Arizona did by utilizing the independent commission procedure in its Constitutionthe resulting redistricting plan becomes the presumptively governing map.
Though four of 2a(c)s five default redistricting proceduresoperative only when a State is not redistricted in the manner provided by [state] lawhave become obsolete as a result of this Courts decisions embracing the one-person, one-vote principle, this infirmity does not bear on the question whether a State has been redistricted in the manner provided by [state] law.  Pp.1923.
(c) The Elections Clause permits the people of Arizona to provide for redistricting by independent commission.  The history and purpose of the Clause weigh heavily against precluding the people of Arizona from creating a commission operating independently of the state legislature to establish congressional districts.  Such preclusion would also run up against the Constitutions animating principle that the people themselves are the originating source of all the powers of government.  Pp.2435.
(1)The dominant purpose of the Elections Clause, the historical record bears out, was to empower Congress to override state election rules, not to restrict the way States enact legislation.  See Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., 570 U.S., at ___.  Ratification arguments in support of congressional oversight focused on potential abuses by state politicians, but the legislative processes by which the States could exercise their initiating role in regulating congressional elections occasioned no debate.  Pp. 2527.
(2)There is no suggestion that the Election Clause, by specifying the Legislature thereof, required assignment of congressional redistricting authority to the States representative body.  It is characteristic of the federal system that States retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes free from incursion by the Federal Government.  See, e.g., Alden v. Maine,527 U.S. 706.  Through the structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority, a State defines itself as a sovereign.  Gregory v. Ashcroft,501 U.S. 452.  Arizona engaged in definition of that kind when its people placed both the initiative power and the AIRCs redistricting authority in the portion of the Arizona Constitution delineating the States legislative authority, Ariz. Const., Art.IV.  The Elections Clause should not be read to single out federal elections as the one area in which States may not use citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process.  And reading the Clause to permit the use of the initiative to control state and local elections but not federal elections would deprive several States of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government held at the same times and places, and in the same manner.  The Federalist No. 61, p. 374 (Hamilton).  Pp.2730.
(3)The Framers may not have imagined the modern initiative process in which the peoples legislative power is coextensive with the state legislatures authority, but the invention of the initiative was in full harmony with the Constitutions conception of the people as the font of governmental power.  It would thus be perverse to interpret Legislature in the Elections Clause to exclude lawmaking by the people, particularly when such lawmaking is intended to advance the prospect that Members of Congress will in fact be chosen ... by the People of the several States,  Art.I, 2.  Pp. 3033.
(4)Banning lawmaking by initiative to direct a States method of apportioning congressional districts would not just stymie attempts to curb gerrymandering.  It would also cast doubt on numerous other time, place, and manner regulations governing federal elections that States have adopted by the initiative method.  As well, it could endanger election provisions in state constitutions adopted by conventions and ratified by voters at the ballot box, without involvement or approval by the Legislature.  Pp.3335.

MICHIGAN et al. v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[1]
No. 1446.Argued March 25, 2015Decided June 29, 2015
The Clean Air Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from certain stationary sources (such as refineries and factories).

42 U.S.C. 7412.  The Agency may regulate power plants under this program only if it concludes that regulation is appropriate and necessary after studying hazards to public health posed by power-plant emissions.  7412(n)(1)(A).  Here, EPA found power-plant regulation appropriate because the plants emissions pose risks to public health and the environment and because controls capable of reducing these emissions were available.  It found regulation necessary because the imposition of other Clean Air Act requirements did not eliminate those risks.  The Agency refused to consider cost when making its decision.  It estimated, however, that the cost of its regulations to power plants would be $9.6 billion a year, but the quantifiable benefits from the resulting reduction in hazardous-air-pollutant emissions would be $4 to $6 million a year.  Petitioners (including 23 States) sought review of EPAs rule in the D.C. Circuit, which upheld the Agencys refusal to consider costs in its decision to regulate.
Held:EPA interpreted 7412(n)(1)(A) unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plants.  Pp.515.
(a)Agency action is unlawful if it does not rest on a consideration of the relevant factors.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,

463 U.S. 29
.  Even under the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
, which directs courts to accept an agencys reasonable resolution of an ambiguity in a statute that the agency administers, id., at 842843, EPA strayed well beyond the bounds of reasonable interpretation in concluding that cost is not a factor relevant to the appropriateness of regulating power plants.  Pp.56.
(b)Appropriate and necessary is a capacious phrase.  Read naturally against the backdrop of established administrative law, this phrase plainly encompasses cost.  It is not rational, never mind appropriate, to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.  Statutory context supports this reading.  Section 7412(n)(1) required the EPA to conduct three studies, including one that reflects concern about cost, see 7412(n)(1)(B); and the Agency agrees that the term appropriate and necessary must be interpreted in light of all three studies.  Pp.69.
(c)EPAs counterarguments are unpersuasive.  That other Clean Air Act provisions expressly mention cost only shows that 7412(n)(1)(A)s broad reference to appropriateness encompasses multiple relevant factors, one of which is cost.  Similarly, the modest principle of Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457

MICHIGAN et al. v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[1]
No. 1446.Argued March 25, 2015Decided June 29, 2015
The Clean Air Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from certain stationary sources (such as refineries and factories).

42 U.S.C. 7412.  The Agency may regulate power plants under this program only if it concludes that regulation is appropriate and necessary after studying hazards to public health posed by power-plant emissions.  7412(n)(1)(A).  Here, EPA found power-plant regulation appropriate because the plants emissions pose risks to public health and the environment and because controls capable of reducing these emissions were available.  It found regulation necessary because the imposition of other Clean Air Act requirements did not eliminate those risks.  The Agency refused to consider cost when making its decision.  It estimated, however, that the cost of its regulations to power plants would be $9.6 billion a year, but the quantifiable benefits from the resulting reduction in hazardous-air-pollutant emissions would be $4 to $6 million a year.  Petitioners (including 23 States) sought review of EPAs rule in the D.C. Circuit, which upheld the Agencys refusal to consider costs in its decision to regulate.
Held:EPA interpreted 7412(n)(1)(A) unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plants.  Pp.515.
(a)Agency action is unlawful if it does not rest on a consideration of the relevant factors.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,

463 U.S. 29
.  Even under the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
, which directs courts to accept an agencys reasonable resolution of an ambiguity in a statute that the agency administers, id., at 842843, EPA strayed well beyond the bounds of reasonable interpretation in concluding that cost is not a factor relevant to the appropriateness of regulating power plants.  Pp.56.
(b)Appropriate and necessary is a capacious phrase.  Read naturally against the backdrop of established administrative law, this phrase plainly encompasses cost.  It is not rational, never mind appropriate, to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.  Statutory context supports this reading.  Section 7412(n)(1) required the EPA to conduct three studies, including one that reflects concern about cost, see 7412(n)(1)(B); and the Agency agrees that the term appropriate and necessary must be interpreted in light of all three studies.  Pp.69.
(c)EPAs counterarguments are unpersuasive.  That other Clean Air Act provisions expressly mention cost only shows that 7412(n)(1)(A)s broad reference to appropriateness encompasses multiple relevant factors, one of which is cost.  Similarly, the modest principle of Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457
when the Clean Air Act expressly directs EPA to regulate on the basis of a discrete factor that does not include cost, the Act should not be read as implicitly allowing consideration of cost anywayhas no bearing on this case.  Furthermore, the possibility of considering cost at a later stage, when deciding how much to regulate power plants, does not establish its irrelevance at this stage.

			The Clean Air Act (CAA) directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from stationary sources, such as refineries and factories, 42 U.S.C. 7412; it may regulate power plants under this program only if it concludes that regulation is appropriate and necessary after studying hazards to public health. EPA found power-plant regulation appropriate because power plant emissions pose risks to public health and the environment and because controls capable of reducing these emissions were available. It found regulation necessary because other CAA requirements did not eliminate those risks. EPA estimated that the cost of power plant regulation would be $9.6 billion a year, but that quantifiable benefits from the reduction in hazardous-air-pollutant emissions would be $4-$6 million a year. The D. C. Circuit upheld EPAs refusal to consider costs.  The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. EPA interpreted section 7412(n)(1)(A) unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plants. Appropriate and necessary is a capacious phrase. It is not rational, nor appropriate, to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits. That other CAA provisions expressly mention cost indicates that section 7412(n)(1)(A)s broad reference to appropriateness encompasses multiple relevant factors, including cost. The possibility of considering cost at a later stage, when deciding how much to regulate power plants, does not establish its irrelevance at the earlier stage. Although the CAA makes cost irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate sources other than power plants, the point of having a separate provision for power plants was to treat power plants differently. EPA must decide how to account for cost.

Syllabus
GLOSSIP etal. v. GROSS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 147955.Argued April 29, 2015Decided June 29, 2015
Because capital punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out.  After Oklahoma adopted lethal injection as its method of execution, it settled on a three-drug protocol of (1)sodium thiopental (a barbiturate) to induce a state of unconsciousness, (2)a paralytic agent to inhibit all muscular-skeletal movements, and (3)potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest.  In Baze v. Rees,

553 U.S. 35
, the Court held that this protocol does not violate the
 
Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.  Anti-death-penalty advocates then pressured pharmaceutical companies to prevent sodium thiopental (and, later, another barbiturate called pentobarbital) from being used in executions.  Unable to obtain either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, Oklahoma decided to use a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, a sedative, as the first drug in its three-drug protocol.
Oklahoma death-row inmates filed a

42 U.S.C. 1983 action claiming that the use of midazolam violates the
 
Eighth Amendment.  Four of those inmates filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and argued that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will not render them unable to feel pain associated with administration of the second and third drugs.  After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion.  It held that the prisoners failed to identify a known and available alternative method of execution that presented a substantially less severe risk of pain.  It also held that the prisoners failed to establish a likelihood of showing that the use of midazolam created a demonstrated risk of severe pain.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Petitioners have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.1129.
(a)To obtain a preliminary injunction, petitioners must establish, among other things, a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

555 U.S. 7
.  To succeed on an
 
Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim, a prisoner must establish that the method creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the risk is substantial when compared to the known and available alternatives.  Baze, supra, at 61 (plurality opinion).  Pp.1113.
(b)Petitioners failed to establish that any risk of harm was substantial when compared to a known and available alternative method of execution.  Petitioners have suggested that Oklahoma could execute them using sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, but the District Court did not commit a clear error when it found that those drugs are unavailable to the State.  Petitioners argue that the
 
Eighth Amendment does not require them to identify such an alternative, but their argument is inconsistent with the controlling opinion in Baze, which imposed a requirement that the Court now follows.  Petitioners also argue that the requirement to identify an alternative is inconsistent with the Courts pre-Baze decision in Hill v. McDonough,

547 U.S. 573
, but they misread that decision.  Hill concerned a question of civil procedure, not a substantive
 
Eighth Amendment question.  That case held that 1983 alone does not require an inmate asserting a method-of-execution claim to plead an acceptable alternative.  Baze, on the other hand, made clear that the
 
Eighth Amendment requires a prisoner to plead and prove a known and available alternative.  Pp.1316.
(c)The District Court did not commit clear error when it found that midazolam is likely to render a person unable to feel pain associated with administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.  Pp.1629.
(1)Several initial considerations bear emphasis.  First, the District Courts factual findings are reviewed under the deferential clear error standard.  Second, petitioners have the burden of persuasion on the question whether midazolam is effective.  Third, the fact that numerous courts have concluded that midazolam is likely to render an inmate insensate to pain during execution heightens the deference owed to the District Courts findings.  Finally, challenges to lethal injection protocols test the boundaries of the authority and competency of federal courts, which should not embroil themselves in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise.  Baze, supra, at 51.  Pp.1618.
(2)The States expert presented persuasive testimony that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would make it a virtual certainty that an inmate will not feel pain associated with the second and third drugs, and petitioners experts acknowledged that they had no contrary scientific proof.  Expert testimony presented by both sides lends support to the District Courts conclusion.  Evidence suggested that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a coma, and even one of petitioners experts agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases, it is expected to produce a lack of response to pain.  It is not dispositive that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during painful surgery.  First, the 500-milligram dose at issue here is many times higher than a normal therapeutic dose.  Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for maintaining unconsciousness says little about whether a 500-milligram dose is constitutionally adequate to conduct an execution.  Finally, the District Court did not err in concluding that the safeguards adopted by Oklahoma to ensure proper administration of midazolam serve to minimize any risk that the drug will not operate as intended.  Pp.1822.
(3)Petitioners speculative evidence regarding midazolams ceiling effect does not establish that the District Courts findings were clearly erroneous.  The mere fact that midazolam has a ceiling above which an increase in dosage produces no effect cannot be dispositive, and petitioners provided little probative evidence on the relevant question, i.e., whether midazolams ceiling effect occurs below the level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by the second and third drugs.  Petitioners attempt to deflect attention from their failure of proof on this point by criticizing the testimony of the States expert.  They emphasize an apparent conflict between the States expert and their own expert regarding the biological process that produces midazolams ceiling effect.  But even if petitioners expert is correct regarding that biological process, it is largely beside the point.  What matters for present purposes is the dosage at which the ceiling effect kicks in, not the biological process that produces the effect.  Pp. 2225.
(4) Petitioners remaining argumentsthat an expert report presented in the District Court should have been rejected because it referenced unreliable sources and contained an alleged mathematical error, that only four States have used midazolam in an execution, and that difficulties during two recent executions suggest that midazolam is ineffectiveall lack merit.  Pp. 2629.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 137120.Argued November 5, 2014Reargued April 20, 2015Decided June 26, 2015
After petitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, see

18 U.S.C. 922(g), the Government sought an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which imposes an increased prison term upon a defendant with three prior convictions for a violent felony, 924(e)(1), a term defined by 924(e)(2)(B)s residual clause to include any felony that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  The Government argued that Johnsons prior conviction for unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun met this definition, making the third conviction of a violent felony.  This Court had previously pronounced upon the meaning of the residual clause in James v. United States,

550 U.S. 192
; Begay v. United States,

553 U.S. 137
; Chambers v. United States,

555 U.S. 122
; and Sykes v. United States,

564 U.S. 1
, and had rejected suggestions by dissenting Justices in both James and Sykes that the clause is void for vagueness.  Here, the District Court held that the residual clause does cover unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, and imposed a 15-year sentence under ACCA.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Imposing an increased sentence under ACCAs residual clause violates due process.  Pp.315.
(a)The Government violates the Due Process Clause when it takes away someones life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson,

461 U.S. 352
358.  Courts must use the categorical approach when deciding whether an offense is a violent felony, looking only to the fact that the defendant has been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.  Taylor v. United States,

495 U.S. 575
.  Deciding whether the residual clause covers a crime thus requires a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case, and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.  James, supra, at 208.  Pp.35.
(b)Two features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.  By tying the judicial assessment of risk to a judicially imagined ordinary case of a crime rather than to real-world facts or statutory elements, the clause leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.  See James, supra, at 211.  At the same time, the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.  Taken together, these uncertainties produce more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.  This Courts repeated failure to craft a principled standard out of the residual clause and the lower courts persistent inability to apply the clause in a consistent way confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.  Pp.510.
(c)This Courts cases squarely contradict the theory that the residual clause is constitutional merely because some underlying crimes may clearly pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See, e.g., United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co.,

255 U.S. 81
.  Holding the residual clause void for vagueness does not put other criminal laws that use terms such as substantial risk in doubt, because those laws generally require gauging the riskiness of an individuals conduct on a particular occasion, not the riskiness of an idealized ordinary case of the crime.  Pp.1013.
(d)The doctrine of stare decisis does not require continued adherence to James and Sykes.  Experience leaves no doubt about the unavoidable uncertainty and arbitrariness of adjudication under the residual clause.  James and Sykes opined about vagueness without full briefing or argument.  And continued adherence to those decisions would undermine, rather than promote, the goals of evenhandedness, predictability, and consistency served by stare decisis.  Pp.1315.

This Courts repeated failure to craft a principled standard out of the residual clause and the lower courts persistent inability to apply the clause in a consistent way confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.  Pp.510.
(c)This Courts cases squarely contradict the theory that the residual clause is constitutional merely because some underlying crimes may clearly pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See, e.g., United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co.,

255 U.S. 81
.  Holding the residual clause void for vagueness does not put other criminal laws that use terms such as substantial risk in doubt, because those laws generally require gauging the riskiness of an individuals conduct on a particular occasion, not the riskiness of an idealized ordinary case of the crime.  Pp.1013.
(d)The doctrine of stare decisis does not require continued adherence to James and Sykes.  Experience leaves no doubt about the unavoidable uncertainty and arbitrariness of adjudication under the residual clause.  James and Sykes opined about vagueness without full briefing or argument.  And continued adherence to those decisions would undermine, rather than promote, the goals of evenhandedness, predictability, and consistency served by stare decisis.  Pp.1315.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., and Thomas, J., filed opinions concurring in the judgment.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion."|"
			After Johnson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. 922(g), the prosecution sought an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which imposes an increased prison term upon a defendant with three prior convictions for a violent felony, a term defined by section 924(e)(2)(B)s residual clause to include any felony that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The government argued that Johnsons prior conviction for unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun met this definition. The district court agreed and imposed a 15-year sentence under ACCA. The Eighth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, rejecting prior holdings in which the Court had spoken to the clause. Imposing an increased sentence under ACCAs residual clause violates due process because that clause is unconstitutionally vague. Courts use the categorical approach when deciding whether an offense is a violent felony, looking only to the fact that the defendant has been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions. Deciding whether the residual clause covers a crime requires a court to picture the ordinary case, and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury. The clause creates uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime and about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony. Holding the clause void for vagueness does not put other laws that use terms such as substantial risk in doubt, because those laws generally require gauging the riskiness of an individuals conduct on a particular occasion, not the riskiness of an idealized ordinary case.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
OBERGEFELL etal. v. HODGES, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 14556.Argued April 28, 2015Decided June 26, 2015[1]
Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee define marriage as a union between one man and one woman.  The petitioners, 14 same-sex couples and two men whose same-sex partners are deceased, filed suits in Federal District Courts in their home States, claiming that respondent state officials violate the
 
Fourteenth Amendment by denying them the right to marry or to have marriages lawfully performed in another State given full recognition.  Each District Court ruled in petitioners favor, but the Sixth Circuit consolidated the cases and reversed.
Held:The
 
Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State.  Pp.328.
(a)Before turning to the governing principles and precedents, it is appropriate to note the history of the subject now before the Court.  Pp.310.
(1)The history of marriage as a union between two persons of the opposite sex marks the beginning of these cases.  To the respondents, it would demean a timeless institution if marriage were extended to same-sex couples.  But the petitioners, far from seeking to devalue marriage, seek it for themselves because of their respectand needfor its privileges and responsibilities, as illustrated by the petitioners own experiences.  Pp.36.
(2)The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change.  Changes, such as the decline of arranged marriages and the abandonment of the law of coverture, have worked deep transformations in the structure of marriage, affecting aspects of marriage once viewed as essential.  These new insights have strengthened, not weakened, the institution.  Changed understandings of marriage are characteristic of a Nation where new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new generations.
This dynamic can be seen in the Nations experience with gay and lesbian rights.  Well into the 20th century, many States condemned same-sex intimacy as immoral, and homosexuality was treated as an illness.  Later in the century, cultural and political developments allowed same-sex couples to lead more open and public lives.  Extensive public and private dialogue followed, along with shifts in public attitudes.  Questions about the legal treatment of gays and lesbians soon reached the courts, where they could be discussed in the formal discourse of the law.  In 2003, this Court overruled its 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick,

478 U.S. 186
, which upheld a Georgia law that criminalized certain homosexual acts, concluding laws making same-sex intimacy a crime demea[n] the lives of homosexual persons.  Lawrence v. Texas,

539 U.S. 558
.  In 2012, the federal Defense of Marriage Act was also struck down.  United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. ___.  Numerous same-sex marriage cases reaching the federal courts and state supreme courts have added to the dialogue.  Pp.610.
(b)The
 
Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex.  Pp.1027.
(1)The fundamental liberties protected by the
 
Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices defining personal identity and beliefs.  See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird,

405 U.S. 438
; Griswold v. Connecticut,

381 U.S. 479
486.  Courts must exercise reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord them its respect.  History and tradition guide and discipline the inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.
Applying these tenets, the Court has long held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution.  For example, Loving v. Virginia,

388 U.S. 1
, invalidated bans on interracial unions, and Turner v. Safley,

482 U.S. 78
, held that prisoners could not be denied the right to marry.  To be sure, these cases presumed a relationship involving opposite-sex partners, as did Baker v. Nelson,

409 U.S. 810
, a one-line summary decision issued in 1972, holding that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage did not present a substantial federal question.  But other, more instructive precedents have expressed broader principles.  See, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 574.  In assessing whether the force and rationale of its cases apply to same-sex couples, the Court must respect the basic reasons why the right to marry has been long protected.  See, e.g., Eisenstadt, supra, at 453454.  This analysis compels the conclusion that same-sex couples may exercise the right to marry.  Pp.1012.
(2)Four principles and traditions demonstrate that the reasons marriage is fundamental under the Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples.  The first premise of this Courts relevant precedents is that the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy.  This abiding connection between marriage and liberty is why Loving invalidated interracial marriage bans under the Due Process Clause.  See 388 U.S., at 12.  Decisions about marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make.  See Lawrence, supra, at 574.  This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation.
A second principle in this Courts jurisprudence is that the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals.  The intimate association protected by this right was central to Griswold v. Connecticut, which held the Constitution protects the right of married couples to use contraception, 381 U.S., at 485, and was acknowledged in Turner, supra, at 95.  Same-sex couples have the same right as opposite-sex couples to enjoy intimate association, a right extending beyond mere freedom from laws making same-sex intimacy a criminal offense.  See Lawrence, supra, at 567.
A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that it safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education.  See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters,

268 U.S. 510
.  Without the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser.  They also suffer the significant material costs of being raised by unmarried parents, relegated to a more difficult and uncertain family life.  The marriage laws at issue thus harm and humiliate the children of same-sex couples.  See Windsor, supra, at ___.  This does not mean that the right to marry is less meaningful for those who do not or cannot have children.  Precedent protects the right of a married couple not to procreate, so the right to marry cannot be conditioned on the capacity or commitment to procreate.
Finally, this Courts cases and the Nations traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of the Nations social order.  See Maynard v. Hill,

125 U.S. 190
.  States have contributed to the fundamental character of marriage by placing it at the center of many facets of the legal and social order.  There is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle, yet same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage and are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would find intolerable.  It is demeaning to lock same-sex couples out of a central institution of the Nations society, for they too may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage.
The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest.  Pp.1218.
(3)The right of same-sex couples to marry is also derived from the
 
Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of equal protection.  The Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause are connected in a profound way.  Rights implicit in liberty and rights secured by equal protection may rest on different precepts and are not always co-extensive, yet each may be instructive as to the meaning and reach of the other.  This dynamic is reflected in Loving, where the Court invoked both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause; and in Zablocki v. Redhail,

434 U.S. 374
, where the Court invalidated a law barring fathers delinquent on child-support payments from marrying.  Indeed, recognizing that new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality within fundamental institutions that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged, this Court has invoked equal protection principles to invalidate laws imposing sex-based inequality on marriage, see, e.g., Kirchberg v. Feenstra,

450 U.S. 455
461, and confirmed the relation between liberty and equality, see, e.g., M.L.B. v. S.L.J.,

519 U.S. 102
121. 
The Court has acknowledged the interlocking nature of these constitutional safeguards in the context of the legal treatment of gays and lesbians.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S., at 575.  This dynamic also applies to same-sex marriage.  The challenged laws burden the liberty of same-sex couples, and they abridge central precepts of equality.  The marriage laws at issue are in essence unequal: Same-sex couples are denied benefits afforded opposite-sex couples and are barred from exercising a fundamental right.  Especially against a long history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial works a grave and continuing harm, serving to disrespect and subordinate gays and lesbians.  Pp.1822.
(4)  The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty.  Same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry.  Baker v. Nelson is overruled.  The State laws challenged by the petitioners in these cases are held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.  Pp.2223.
(5)There may be an initial inclination to await further legislation, litigation, and debate, but referenda, legislative debates, and grassroots campaigns; studies and other writings; and extensive litigation in state and federal courts have led to an enhanced understanding of the issue.  While the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change, individuals who are harmed need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.  Bowers, in effect, upheld state action that denied gays and lesbians a fundamental right.  Though it was eventually repudiated, men and women suffered pain and humiliation in the interim, and the effects of these injuries no doubt lingered long after Bowers was overruled.  A ruling against same-sex couples would have the same effect and would be unjustified under the
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  The petitioners stories show the urgency of the issue they present to the Court, which has a duty to address these claims and answer these questions.  Respondents argument that allowing same-sex couples to wed will harm marriage as an institution rests on a counterintuitive view of opposite-sex couples decisions about marriage and parenthood.  Finally, the
 
First Amendment ensures that religions, those who adhere to religious doctrines, and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.  Pp.2327.
(c)The
 
Fourteenth Amendment requires States to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed out of State.  Since same-sex couples may now exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States, there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.  Pp.2728.

Syllabus
TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS etal. v. INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 131371.Argued January 21, 2015Decided June 25, 2015
The Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that are distributed to developers by designated state agencies.  In Texas, the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department) distributes the credits.  The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact claim under 804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), alleging that the Department and its officers had caused continued segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods.  Relying on statistical evidence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  After assuming the Departments proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.  While the Departments appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.  The Fifth Circuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA, but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives. 
The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had left predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs, the Act addresses the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin.  In 1988, Congress amended the FHA, and, as relevant here, created certain exemptions from liability.  
Held:Disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act.  Pp.724.
(a)Two antidiscrimination statutes that preceded the FHA are relevant to its interpretation.  Both 703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) authorize disparate-impact claims.  Under Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,

TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS etal. v. INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 131371.Argued January 21, 2015Decided June 25, 2015
The Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that are distributed to developers by designated state agencies.  In Texas, the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department) distributes the credits.  The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact claim under 804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), alleging that the Department and its officers had caused continued segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods.  Relying on statistical evidence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  After assuming the Departments proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.  While the Departments appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.  The Fifth Circuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA, but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives. 
The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had left predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs, the Act addresses the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin.  In 1988, Congress amended the FHA, and, as relevant here, created certain exemptions from liability.  
Held:Disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act.  Pp.724.
(a)Two antidiscrimination statutes that preceded the FHA are relevant to its interpretation.  Both 703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) authorize disparate-impact claims.  Under Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,

KING etal. v. BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 14114.Argued March 4, 2015Decided June 25, 2015
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform.  In the 1990s, several States sought to expand access to coverage by imposing a pair of insurance market regulationsa guaranteed issue requirement, which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person because of his health, and a community rating requirement, which bars insurers from charging a person higher premiums for the same reason.  The reforms achieved the goal of expanding access to coverage, but they also encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance.  The result was an economic death spiral: premiums rose, the number of people buying insurance declined, and insurers left the market entirely.  In 2006, however, Massachusetts discovered a way to make the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements workby requiring individuals to buy insurance and by providing tax credits to certain individuals to make insurance more affordable.  The combination of these three reformsinsurance market regulations, a coverage mandate, and tax creditsenabled Massachusetts to drastically reduce its uninsured rate.
The Affordable Care Act adopts a version of the three key reforms that made the Massachusetts system successful.  First, the Act adopts the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.  42 U.S.C. 300gg, 300gg1.  Second, the Act generally requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS, unless the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of that individuals income.

26 U.S.C. 5000A.  And third, the Act seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  36B.
In addition to those three reforms, the Act requires the creation of an Exchange in each Statebasically, a marketplace that allows people to compare and purchase insurance plans.  The Act gives each State the opportunity to establish its own Exchange, but provides that the Federal Government will establish such Exchange if the State does not.  42 U.S.C. 18031, 18041.  Relatedly, the Act provides that tax credits shall be allowed for any applicable taxpayer,

26 U.S.C. 36B(a), but only if the taxpayer has enrolled in an insurance plan through an Exchange established by the State under [

42 U.S.C. 18031], 36B(b)(c).  An IRS regulation interprets that language as making tax credits available on an Exchange, 26 CFR 1.36B2, regardless of whether the Exchange is established and operated by a State ... or by HHS, 45 CFR 155.20.
Petitioners are four individuals who live in Virginia, which has a Federal Exchange.  They do not wish to purchase health insurance.  In their view, Virginias Exchange does not qualify as an Exchange established by the State under [

42 U.S.C. 18031], so they should not receive any tax credits.  That would make the cost of buying insurance more than eight percent of petitioners income, exempting them from the Acts coverage requirement.  As a result of the IRS Rule, however, petitioners would receive tax credits.  That would make the cost of buying insurance less than eight percent of their income, which would subject them to the Acts coverage requirement.
Petitioners challenged the IRS Rule in Federal District Court.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the Act unambiguously made tax credits available to individuals enrolled through a Federal Exchange.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The Fourth Circuit viewed the Act as ambiguous, and deferred to the IRSs interpretation under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
.
Held:Section 36Bs tax credits are available to individuals in States that have a Federal Exchange.  Pp.721.
(a)When analyzing an agencys interpretation of a statute, this Court often applies the two-step framework announced in Chevron,

467 U.S. 837
.  But Chevron does not provide the appropriate framework here.  The tax credits are one of the Acts key reforms and whether they are available on Federal Exchanges is a question of deep economic and political significance; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.  And it is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the IRS, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort.
It is instead the Courts task to determine the correct reading of Section 36B.  If the statutory language is plain, the Court must enforce it according to its terms.  But oftentimes the meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.  So when deciding whether the language is plain, the Court must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,

529 U.S. 120
.  Pp.79.
(b)When read in context, the phrase an Exchange established by the State under [

42 U.S.C. 18031] is properly viewed as ambiguous.  The phrase may be limited in its reach to State Exchanges.  But it could also refer to all Exchangesboth State and Federalfor purposes of the tax credits.  If a State chooses not to follow the directive in Section 18031 to establish an Exchange, the Act tells the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish such Exchange.  18041.  And by using the words such Exchange, the Act indicates that State and Federal Exchanges should be the same.  But State and Federal Exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on State Exchangesone type of Exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the States citizens; the other type of Exchange would not.  Several other provisions in the Acte.g., Section 18031(i)(3)(B)s requirement that all Exchanges create outreach programs to distribute fair and impartial information concerning ... the availability of premium tax credits under section 36Bwould make little sense if tax credits were not available on Federal Exchanges.
The argument that the phrase established by the State would be superfluous if Congress meant to extend tax credits to both State and Federal Exchanges is unpersuasive.  This Courts preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.  Lamie v. United States Trustee,

540 U.S. 526
.  And rigorous application of that canon does not seem a particularly useful guide to a fair construction of the Affordable Care Act, which contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.  The Court nevertheless must do its best, bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.915.
(c)Given that the text is ambiguous, the Court must look to the broader structure of the Act to determine whether one of Section 36Bs permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.  United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,

484 U.S. 365
.
Here, the statutory scheme compels the Court to reject petitioners interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very death spirals that Congress designed the Act to avoid.  Under petitioners reading, the Act would not work in a State with a Federal Exchange.  As they see it, one of the Acts three major reformsthe tax creditswould not apply.  And a second major reformthe coverage requirementwould not apply in a meaningful way, because so many individuals would be exempt from the requirement without the tax credits.  If petitioners are right, therefore, only one of the Acts three major reforms would apply in States with a Federal Exchange.The combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a States individual insurance market into a death spiral.  It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.  Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation, but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits.  It thus stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.  Pp.1519.
(d)The structure of Section 36B itself also suggests that tax credits are not limited to State Exchanges.  Together, Section 36B(a), which allows tax credits for any applicable taxpayer, and Section 36B(c)(1), which defines that term as someone with a household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line, appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible for a tax credit.  According to petitioners, however, those provisions are an empty promise in States with a Federal Exchange.  In their view, an applicable taxpayer in such a State would be eligible for a tax credit, but the amount of that tax credit would always be zero because of two provisions buried deep within the Tax Code.  That argument fails because Congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.  Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457
.  Pp.1920.
(e)Petitioners plain-meaning arguments are strong, but the Acts context and structure compel the conclusion that Section 36B allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any Exchange created under the Act.  Those credits are necessary for the Federal Exchanges to function like their State Exchange counterparts, and to avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid.  Pp.2021.

.  And rigorous application of that canon does not seem a particularly useful guide to a fair construction of the Affordable Care Act, which contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.  The Court nevertheless must do its best, bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. ___, ___.  Pp.915.
(c)Given that the text is ambiguous, the Court must look to the broader structure of the Act to determine whether one of Section 36Bs permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.  United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,

484 U.S. 365
.
Here, the statutory scheme compels the Court to reject petitioners interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very death spirals that Congress designed the Act to avoid.  Under petitioners reading, the Act would not work in a State with a Federal Exchange.  As they see it, one of the Acts three major reformsthe tax creditswould not apply.  And a second major reformthe coverage requirementwould not apply in a meaningful way, because so many individuals would be exempt from the requirement without the tax credits.  If petitioners are right, therefore, only one of the Acts three major reforms would apply in States with a Federal Exchange.The combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a States individual insurance market into a death spiral.  It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.  Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation, but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits.  It thus stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.  Pp.1519.
(d)The structure of Section 36B itself also suggests that tax credits are not limited to State Exchanges.  Together, Section 36B(a), which allows tax credits for any applicable taxpayer, and Section 36B(c)(1), which defines that term as someone with a household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line, appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible for a tax credit.  According to petitioners, however, those provisions are an empty promise in States with a Federal Exchange.  In their view, an applicable taxpayer in such a State would be eligible for a tax credit, but the amount of that tax credit would always be zero because of two provisions buried deep within the Tax Code.  That argument fails because Congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.  Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457
.  Pp.1920.
(e)Petitioners plain-meaning arguments are strong, but the Acts context and structure compel the conclusion that Section 36B allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any Exchange created under the Act.  Those credits are necessary for the Federal Exchanges to function like their State Exchange counterparts, and to avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid.  Pp.2021.
759 F.3d 358, affirmed.

			The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C 18001) includes guaranteed issue and community rating requirements, which bar insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on health; requires  individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS, unless the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of that individuals income; and seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between 100 per cent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line. The Act requires creation of an Exchange in each state a marketplace to compare and purchase insurance plans; the federal government will establish such Exchange if the state does not. The Act provides that tax credits shall be allowed for any applicable taxpayer, only if the taxpayer has enrolled in an insurance plan through an Exchange established by the State under [42 U.S.C. 18031], An IRS regulation interprets that language as making credits available regardless of whether the exchange is established by a state or the federal government. Plaintiffs live in Virginia, which has a federal exchange. They argued Virginias Exchange does not qualify as an Exchange established by the State, so they should not receive any tax credits. That would make the cost of buying insurance more than eight percent of their income, exempting them from the coverage requirement. The district court dismissed their suit. The Fourth Circuit and Supreme Court affirmed. Tax credits are available to individuals in states that have a federal exchange. Given that the text is ambiguous, the Court looked to the broader structure of the Act and concluded that plaintiffs interpretation would destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange.  It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in that manner. Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every state, but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA v. PATEL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131175.Argued March 3, 2015Decided June 22, 2015
Petitioner, the city of Los Angeles (City), requires hotel operators to record and keep specific information about their guests on the premises for a 90-day period.  Los Angeles Municipal Code 41.49.  These records shall be made available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection ... at a time and in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operation of the business, 41.49(3)(a), and a hotel operators failure to make the records available is a criminal misdemeanor, 11.00(m).  Respondents, a group of motel operators and a lodging association, brought a facial challenge to 41.49(3)(a) on
 
Fourth Amendment grounds.  The District Court entered judgment for the City, finding that respondents lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in their records.  The Ninth Circuit subsequently reversed, determining that inspections under 41.49(3)(a) are
 
Fourth Amendment searches and that such searches are unreasonable under the
 
Fourth Amendment because hotel owners are subjected to punishment for failure to turn over their records without first being afforded the opportunity for precompliance review.
Held:
1.Facial challenges under the
 
Fourth Amendment are not categorically barred or especially disfavored.  Pp.48.
(a)Facial challenges to statutesas opposed to challenges to particular applications of statuteshave been permitted to proceed under a diverse array of constitutional provisions.  See, e.g., Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. ___ (
 
First Amendment); District of Columbia v. Heller,

554 U.S. 570
 (
 
Second Amendment).  The
 
Fourth Amendment is no exception.  Sibron v. New York,

392 U.S. 40
, distinguished.  This Court has entertained facial challenges to statutes authorizing warrantless searches, declaring them, on several occasions, facially invalid, see, e.g., Chandler v. Miller,

520 U.S. 305
309.  Pp.47.
(b)Petitioner contends that facial challenges to statutes authorizing warrantless searches must fail because they will never be unconstitutional in all applications, but this Courts precedents demonstrate that such challenges can be brought, and can succeed.  Under the proper facial-challenge analysis, only applications of a statute in which the statute actually authorizes or prohibits conduct are considered.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,

505 U.S. 833
.  When addressing a facial challenge to a statute authorizing warrantless searches, the proper focus is on searches that the law actually authorizes and not those that could proceed irrespective of whether they are authorized by the statute, e.g., where exigent circumstances, a warrant, or consent to search exists.  Pp.78.
2.Section 41.49(3)(a) is facially unconstitutional because it fails to provide hotel operators with an opportunity for precompliance review.  Pp.917.
(a)[S]earches conducted outside the judicial process ... are perse unreasonable under the
 
Fourth Amendmentsubject only to a few ... exceptions.  Arizona v. Gant,

556 U.S. 332
.  One exception is for administrative searches.  See Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco,

387 U.S. 523
.  To be constitutional, the subject of an administrative search must, among other things, be afforded an opportunity to obtain precompliance review before a neutral decisionmaker.  See See v. Seattle,

387 U.S. 541
.  Assuming the administrative search exception otherwise applies here, 41.49 is facially invalid because it fails to afford hotel operators any opportunity for precompliance review.  To be clear, a hotel owner must only be afforded an opportunity for precompliance review; actual review need occur only when a hotel operator objects to turning over the records.  This opportunity can be provided without imposing onerous burdens on law enforcement.  For instance, officers in the field can issue administrative subpoenas without probable cause that a regulation is being infringed.  This narrow holding does not call into question those parts of 41.49 requiring hotel operators to keep records nor does it prevent police from obtaining access to those records where a hotel operator consents to the search, where the officer has a proper administrative warrant, or where some other exception to the warrant requirement applies.  Pp.913.
(b)Petitioners argument that the ordinance is facially valid under the more relaxed standard for closely regulated industries is rejected.  See Marshall v. Barlows, Inc.,

436 U.S. 307
.  This Court has only recognized four such industries, and nothing inherent in the operation of hotels poses a comparable clear and significant risk to the public welfare.  Additionally, because the majority of regulations applicable to hotels apply to many businesses, to classify hotels as closely regulated would permit what has always been a narrow exception to swallow the rule.  But even if hotels were closely regulated, 41.49 would still contravene the
 
Fourth Amendment as it fails to satisfy the additional criteria that must be met for searches of closely regulated industries to be reasonable.  See New York v. Burger,

482 U.S. 691
703.  Pp.1317.
738 F.3d 1058, affirmed.

KIMBLE etal. v. MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, LLC, successor to MARVEL ENTERPRISES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13720.Argued March 31, 2015Decided June 22, 2015
Respondent Marvel Entertainments corporate predecessor agreed to purchase petitioner Stephen Kimbles patent for a Spider-Man toy in exchange for a lump sum plus a 3% royalty on future sales.  The agreement set no end date for royalties.  As the patent neared the end of its statutory 20-year term, Marvel discovered Brulotte v. Thys Co.,

379 U.S. 29
, in which this Court held that a patentee cannot continue to receive royalties for sales made after his patent expires.  Marvel then sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court confirming that it could stop paying Kimble royalties.  The district court granted relief, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Kimble now asks this Court to overrule Brulotte.
Held:Stare decisis requires this Court to adhere to Brulotte.  Pp.318.
(a)A patent typically expires 20 years from its application date.

35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2). At that point, the unrestricted right to make or use the article passes to the public.  See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.,

376 U.S. 225
.  This Court has carefully guarded the significance of that expiration date, declining to enforce laws and contracts that restrict free public access to formerly patented, as well as unpatentable, inventions.  See, e.g., id., at 230233; Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co.,

326 U.S. 249
256.
Brulotte applied that principle to a patent licensing agreement that provided for the payment of royalties accruing after the patents expiration.  379 U.S., at 30.  The Court held that the post-patent royalty provision was unlawful perse, id., at 30, 32, because it continued the patent monopoly beyond the [patent] period, id., at 33, and, in so doing, conflicted with patent laws policy of establishing a post-expiration ... public domain, ibid.
The Brulotte rule may prevent some parties from entering into deals they desire, but parties can often find ways to achieve similar outcomes.  For example, Brulotte leaves parties free to defer payments for pre-expiration use of a patent, tie royalties to non-patent rights, or make non-royalty-based business arrangements.  Contending that such alternatives are not enough, Kimble asks this Court to abandon Brulottes bright-line rule in favor of a case-by-case approach based on antitrust laws rule of reason.  Pp.37.
(b)The doctrine of stare decisis provides that todays Court should stand by yesterdays decisions.  Application of that doctrine, though not an inexorable command, is the preferred course.  Payne v. Tennessee,

501 U.S. 808
.  Overruling a case always requires special justificationover and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided.  Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. ___, ___.  Where, as here, the precedent interprets a statute, stare decisis carries enhanced force, since critics are free to take their objections to Congress.  See e.g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,

491 U.S. 164
173.  Congress, moreover, has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse Brulotte, see Watson v. United States,

552 U.S. 74
83, and has even rebuffed bills that would have replaced Brulottes perse rule with the standard Kimble urges.  In addition, Brulotte implicates property and contract law, two contexts in which considerations favoring stare decisis are at their acme, Payne, 501 U.S., at 828, because parties are especially likely to rely on such precedents when ordering their affairs.  
Given those good reasons for adhering to stare decisis in this case, this Court would need a very strong justification for overruling Brulotte.  But traditional justifications for abandoning stare decisis do not help Kimble here.  First, Brulottes doctrinal underpinnings have not eroded over time.  The patent statute at issue in Brulotte is essentially unchanged.  And the precedent on which the Brulotte Court primarily relied, like other decisions enforcing a patents cut-off date, remains good law.  Indeed, Brulottes close relation to a whole web of precedents means that overruling it could threaten others.  Second, nothing about Brulotte has proved unworkable.  See Patterson, 491 U.S., at 173.  To the contrary, the decision itself is simple to applyparticularly as compared to Kimbles proposed alternative, which can produce high litigation costs and unpredictable results.  Pp.712.
(c)Neither of the justifications Kimble offers gives cause to overrule Brulotte.  Pp.1218.
(1) Kimble first argues the Brulotte hinged on an economic errori.e., an assumption that post-expiration royalties are always anticompetitive.  This Court sees no error in Kimbles economic analysis.  But even assuming Kimble is right that Brulotte relied on an economic misjudgment, Congress is the right entity to fix it.  The patent laws are not like the Sherman Act, which gives courts exceptional authority to shape the law and reconsider precedent based on better economic analysis.  Moreover, Kimbles argument is based not on evolving economic theory but rather on a claim that the Brulotte Court simply made the wrong call.  That claim fails to clear stare decisiss high bar.  In any event, Brulotte did not even turn on the notion that post-patent royalties harm competition.  Instead, the Brulotte Court simply applied the categorical principle that all patent-related benefits must end when the patent term expires.  Kimbles real complaint may go to the merits of that principle as a policy matter.   But Congress, not this Court, gets to make patent policy.  Pp.1216.
(2)Kimble also argues that Brulotte suppresses technological innovation and harms the national economy by preventing parties from reaching agreements to commercialize patents.  This Court cannot tell whether that is true.  Brulotte leaves parties free to enter alternative arrangements that may suffice to accomplish parties payment deferral and risk-spreading goals.  And neither Kimble nor his amici offer any empirical evidence connecting Brulotte to decreased innovation.  In any event, claims about a statutory precedents consequences for innovation are more appropriately addressed to Congress.  Halliburton, 573 U.S., at ___.  Pp.1618.
727 F.3d 856, affirmed.

			Marvel Entertainments corporate predecessor agreed to purchase Kimbles patent for a Spider-Man toy in exchange for a lump sum plus a 3% royalty on future sales. The agreement set no end date for royalties. As the patent neared the end of its statutory 20-year term, Marvel discovered Brulotte v. Thys Co., in which the Supreme Court held that a patentee cannot continue to receive royalties for sales made after his patent expires and sought a declaratory judgment that it could stop paying Kimble royalties. The district court granted relief. The Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court affirmed, adhering to Brulotte. A patent typically expires 20 years from its application date. 35 U S.C. 154(a)(2). At that point, the unrestricted right to make or use the article passes to the public. The Brulotte rule may prevent some parties from entering into deals they desire, but parties can often find ways to achieve similar outcomes. Congress, moreover, has had multiple opportunities to reverse Brulotte and has even rejected bills that would have replaced Brulottes per se rule with the rule of reason standard. Congress, not the Court, gets to make patent policy.

HORNE etal. v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 14275.Argued April 22, 2015Decided June 22, 2015
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate marketing orders to help maintain stable markets for particular agricultural products.  The marketing order for raisins established a Raisin Administrative Committee that imposes a reserve requirementa requirement that growers set aside a certain percentage of their crop for the account of the Government, free of charge.  The Government makes use of those raisins by selling them in noncompetitive markets, donating them, or disposing of them by any means consistent with the purposes of the program.  If any profits are left over after subtracting the Governments expenses from administering the program, the net proceeds are distributed back to the raisin growers.  In 20022003, raisin growers were required to set aside 47 percent of their raisin crop under the reserve requirement.  In 20032004, 30 percent.  Marvin Horne, Laura Horne, and their family are raisin growers who refused to set aside any raisins for the Government on the ground that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property for public use without just compensation.  The Government fined the Hornes the fair market value of the raisins as well as additional civil penalties for their failure to obey the raisin marketing order. 
The Hornes sought relief in federal court, arguing that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the
 
Fifth Amendment.  On remand from this Court over the issue of jurisdiction, Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 569 U.S. ___, the Ninth Circuit held that the reserve requirement was not a
 
Fifth Amendment taking.  The court determined that the requirement was not a perse taking because personal property is afforded less protection under the Takings Clause than real property and because the Hornes, who retained an interest in any net proceeds, were not completely divested of their property.  The Ninth Circuit held that, as in cases allowing the government to set conditions on land use and development, the Government imposed a condition (the reserve requirement) in exchange for a Government benefit (an orderly raisin market).  It held that the Hornes could avoid relinquishing large percentages of their crop by planting different crops.  730 F.3d 1128, 1143.  
Held:The
 
Fifth Amendment requires that the Government pay just compensation when it takes personal property, just as when it takes real property.  Any net proceeds the raisin growers receive from the sale of the reserve raisins goes to the amount of compensation they have received for that takingit does not mean the raisins have not been appropriated for Government use.  Nor can the Government make raisin growers relinquish their property without just compensation as a condition of selling their raisins in interstate commerce.  Pp.418.
(a)The
 
Fifth Amendment applies to personal property as well as real property.  The Government has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.  Pp.49.  
(1)This principle, dating back as far as Magna Carta, was codified in the Takings Clause in part because of property appropriations by both sides during the Revolutionary War.  This Court has noted that an owner of personal property may expect that new regulation of the use of property could render his property economically worthless.  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,

.  When it comes to physical appropriations, people do not expect their property, real or personal, to be actually occupied or taken away.  Pp.48.
(2)The reserve requirement imposed by the Raisin Committee is a clear physical taking.  Actual raisins are transferred from the growers to the Government.  Title to the raisins passes to the Raisin Committee.  The Committee disposes of those raisins as it wishes, to promote the purposes of the raisin marketing order.  The Governments formal demand that the Hornes turn over a percentage of their raisin crop without charge, for the Governments control and use, is of such a unique character that it is a taking without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine.  Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,

458 U.S. 419

(b) The fact that the growers are entitled to the net proceeds of the raisin sales does not mean that there has been no taking at all.  When there has been a physical appropriation, we do not ask ... whether it deprives the owner of all economically valuable use of the item taken.  Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, 535 U.S., at 323.  The fact that the growers retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value does not mean there has been no taking, particularly when that interest depends on the discretion of the taker, and may be worthless, as it was for one of the two years at issue here.  Andrus v. Allard,

, distinguished.  Once there is a taking, as in the case of a physical appropriation, any payment from the Government in connection with that action goes, at most, to the question of just compensation.  Pp.912.
(c)The taking in this case also cannot be characterized as part of a voluntary exchange for a valuable government benefit.  In one of the years at issue, the Government insisted that the Hornes part with 47 percent of their crop for the privilege of selling the rest.  But the ability to sell produce in interstate commerce, although certainly subject to reasonable government regulation, is not a benefit that the Government may withhold unless growers waive constitutional protections.

 (d)The Hornes are not required to first pay the fine and then seek compensation under the Tucker Act.  See Horne, 569 U.S., at ___.  Because they have the full economic interest in the raisins the Government alleges should have been set aside for its accounti.e., they own the raisins they grew as well as the raisins they handled, having paid the growers for all of their raisins, not just their free-tonnage raisinsthey may raise a takings-based defense to the fine levied against them.  There is no need for the Ninth Circuit to calculate the just compensation due on remand.  The clear and administrable rule is that just compensation normally is to be measured by the market value of the property at the time of the taking.  United States v. 50 Acres of Land,

KINGSLEY v. HENDRICKSON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 146368.Argued April 27, 2015Decided  June 22, 2015
While petitioner Kingsley was awaiting trial in county jail, officers forcibly removed him from his cell when he refused to comply with their instructions.  Kingsley filed a complaint in Federal District Court claiming, as relevant here, that two of the officers used excessive force against him in violation of the
 
Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.  At the trials conclusion, the District Court instructed the jury that Kingsley was required to prove, inter alia, that the officers recklessly disregarded [Kingsleys] safety and acted with reckless disregard of [his] rights.  The jury found in the officers favor.  On appeal, Kingsley argued that the jury instruction did not adhere to the proper standard for judging a pretrial detainees excessive force claim, namely, objective unreasonableness.  The Seventh Circuit disagreed, holding that the law required a subjective inquiry into the officers state of mind, i.e., whether the officers actually intended to violate, or recklessly disregarded, Kingsleys rights.
Held:
1.  Under

42 U.S.C. 1983, a pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable to prevail on an excessive force claim.  Pp.513.  
(a) This determination must be made from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, including what the officer knew at the time, see Graham v. Connor, 

490 U.S. 386
, and must account for the legitimate interests [stemming from the governments] need to manage the facility in which the individual is detained, appropriately deferring to policies and practices that in th[e] judgment of jail officials are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 540, 547.  Pp.57.
(b) Several considerations lead to this conclusion.  An objective standard is consistent with precedent.  In Bell, for instance, this Court held that a pretrial detainee could prevail on a claim that his due process rights were violated by providing only objective evidence that the challenged governmental action was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or that it was excessive in relation to that purpose.  441 U.S., at 541543.  Cf. Block v. Rutherford,

468 U.S. 576
586.  Experience also suggests that an objective standard is workable.  It is consistent with the pattern jury instructions used in several Circuits, and many facilities train officers to interact with detainees as if the officers conduct is subject to objective reasonableness.  Finally, the use of an objective standard adequately protects an officer who acts in good faith, e.g., by acknowledging that judging the reasonableness of the force used from the perspective and with the knowledge of the defendant officer is an appropriate part of the analysis.  Pp.710.
(c) None of the cases respondents point to provides significant support for a subjective standard.  Whitley v. Albers,

475 U.S. 312
, and Hudson v. McMillian,

503 U.S. 1
, lack relevance in this context because they involved claims brought by convicted prisoners under the
 
Eighth Amendments Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, not claims brought by pretrial detainees under the
 
Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.  And in County of Sacramento v. Lewis,

523 U.S. 833
, a statement indicating the need to show purpose to cause harm, id., at 854, for due process liability refers not to whether the force intentionally used was excessive, but whether the defendant intended to commit the acts in question, id., at 854, and n.13.  Finally, in Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028 (CA2), a malicious-and-sadistic-purpose-to-cause-harm factor was not suggested as a necessary condition for liability, but as a factor, among others, that might help show that the use of force was excessive.  Pp.1013.
2. Applying the proper standard, the jury instruction was erroneous.  Taken together, the features of that instruction suggested that the jury should weigh respondents subjective reasons for using force and subjective views about the excessiveness of that force.  Respondents claim that, irrespective of this Courts holding, any error in the instruction was harmless is left to the Seventh Circuit to resolve on remand.  Pp.1314.
744 F.3d 443, vacated and remanded.

OHIO v. CLARK
certiorari to the supreme court of ohio
No. 131352.Argued March 2, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
Respondent Darius Clark sent his girlfriend away to engage in prostitution while he cared for her 3-year-old son L.P. and 18-month-old daughter A. T.  When L.P.s preschool teachers noticed marks on his body, he identified Clark as his abuser.  Clark was subsequently tried on multiple counts related to the abuse of both children.  At trial, the State introduced L.P.s statements to his teachers as evidence of Clarks guilt, but L.P. did not testify.  The trial court denied Clarks motion to exclude the statements under the
 
Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause.  A jury convicted Clark on all but one count.  The state appellate court reversed the conviction on Confrontation Clause grounds, and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed.
Held:The introduction of L.P.s statements at trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.412.
(a)This Courts decision in Crawford v. Washington,

541 U.S. 36
, held that the Confrontation Clause generally prohibits the introduction of testimonial statements by a nontestifying witness, unless the witness is unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.   A statement qualifies as testimonial if the primary purpose of the conversation was to creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.  Michigan v. Bryant,

562 U.S. 344
.  In making that primary purpose determination, courts must consider all of the relevant circumstances.  Ibid.  Where no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.  Id., at 359.  But that does not mean that the Confrontation Clause bars every statement that satisfies the primary purpose test.  The Court has recognized that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the introduction of out-of-court statements that would have been admissible in a criminal case at the time of the founding.  See Giles v. California,

554 U.S. 353
359; Crawford, 541 U.S., at 56, n.6, 62.  Thus, the primary purpose test is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition for the exclusion of out-of-court statements under the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.47.
(b)Considering all the relevant circumstances, L.P.s statements were not testimonial.  L.P.s statements were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence for Clarks prosecution.  They occurred in the context of an ongoing emergency involving suspected child abuse.  L.P.s teachers asked questions aimed at identifying and ending a threat.  They did not inform the child that his answers would be used to arrest or punish his abuser.  L. P. never hinted that he intended his statements to be used by the police or prosecutors.  And the conversation was informal and spontaneous.  L.P.s age further confirms that the statements in question were not testimonial because statements by very young children will rarely, if ever, implicate the Confrontation Clause.  As a historical matter, moreover, there is strong evidence that statements made in circumstances like these were regularly admitted at common law.  Finally, although statements to individuals other than law enforcement officers are not categorically outside the
 
Sixth Amendments reach, the fact that L.P. was speaking to his teachers is highly relevant.  Statements to individuals who are not principally charged with uncovering and prosecuting criminal behavior are significantly less likely to be testimonial than those given to law enforcement officers.  Pp.710.
(c)Clarks arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Mandatory reporting obligations do not convert a conversation between a concerned teacher and her student into a law enforcement mission aimed at gathering evidence for prosecution.  It is irrelevant that the teachers questions and their duty to report the matter had the natural tendency to result in Clarks prosecution.  And this Courts Confrontation Clause decisions do not determine whether a statement is testimonial by examining whether a jury would view the statement as the equivalent of in-court testimony.  Instead, the test is whether a statement was given with the primary purpose of creating an out-of-courtsubstitute for trial testimony.  Bryant, supra, at 358.  Here, the answer is clear: L.

OHIO v. CLARK
certiorari to the supreme court of ohio
No. 131352.Argued March 2, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
Respondent Darius Clark sent his girlfriend away to engage in prostitution while he cared for her 3-year-old son L.P. and 18-month-old daughter A. T.  When L.P.s preschool teachers noticed marks on his body, he identified Clark as his abuser.  Clark was subsequently tried on multiple counts related to the abuse of both children.  At trial, the State introduced L.P.s statements to his teachers as evidence of Clarks guilt, but L.P. did not testify.  The trial court denied Clarks motion to exclude the statements under the
 
Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause.  A jury convicted Clark on all but one count.  The state appellate court reversed the conviction on Confrontation Clause grounds, and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed.
Held:The introduction of L.P.s statements at trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.412.
(a)This Courts decision in Crawford v. Washington,

541 U.S. 36
, held that the Confrontation Clause generally prohibits the introduction of testimonial statements by a nontestifying witness, unless the witness is unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.   A statement qualifies as testimonial if the primary purpose of the conversation was to creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.  Michigan v. Bryant,

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
DAVIS, ACTING WARDEN v. AYALA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131428.Argued March 3, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
During jury selection in respondent Ayalas murder trial, Ayala, who is Hispanic, objected that seven of the prosecutions peremptory challenges were impermissibly race-based under Batson v. Kentucky,

476 U.S. 79
.  The judge permitted the prosecution to disclose its reasons for the strikes outside the presence of the defense and concluded that the prosecution had valid, race-neutral reasons for the strikes.  Ayala was eventually convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal, the California Supreme Court analyzed Ayalas challenge under both Batson and its state-law analogue, concluding that it was error, as a matter of state law, to exclude Ayala from the hearings.  The court held, however, that the error was harmless under state law and that, if a federal error occurred, it too was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California,

386 U.S. 18
.  Ayala subsequently pressed his claims in federal court.  There, the District Court held that even if the exparte proceedings violated federal law, the state courts harmlessness finding could not be overturned because it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under 28  U.S.C. 2254(d).  A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit disagreed and granted Ayala habeas relief.  The panel majority held that the exparte proceedings violated Ayalas federal constitutional rights and that the error was not harmless under Brecht v. Abrahamson,

507 U.S. 619
, as to at least three of the seven prospective jurors.
Held:Any federal constitutional error that may have occurred by excluding Ayalas attorney from part of the Batson hearing was harmless.  Pp.929.
(a) Even assuming that Ayalas federal rights were violated, he is entitled to habeas relief only if the prosecution cannot demonstrate harmlessness.  Glebe v. Frost, 574 U.S. ___, ___.  Under Brecht, federal habeas petitioners are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice.  507 U.S., at 637.  Because Ayala seeks federal habeas corpus relief, he must meet the Brecht standard, but that does not mean, as the Ninth Circuit thought, that a state courts harmlessness determination has no significance under Brecht.  The Brecht standard subsumes the requirements that 2254(d) imposes when a federal habeas petitioner contests a state courts determination that a constitutional error was harmless under Chapman.  Fry v. Pliler,

551 U.S. 112
.  But Brecht did not abrogate the limitation on federal habeas relief that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 plainly sets out.  There is no dispute that the California Supreme Court held that any federal error was harmless under Chapman, and this decision was an adjudication on the merits of Ayalas claim.  Accordingly, a federal court cannot grant Ayala relief unless the state courts rejection of his claim was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  Pp.912.
(b)Any federal constitutional error was harmless with respect to all seven prospective jurors.  Pp.1228.
(1)The prosecution stated that it struck Olanders D., an African-American man, because it was concerned that he could not impose the death penalty and because of the poor quality of his responses.  As the trial court and State Supreme Court found, the record amply supports the prosecutions concerns, and Ayala cannot establish that the exparte hearing prejudiced him.  The Ninth Circuit misunderstood the role of a federal court in a habeas case.  That role is not to conduct denovo review of factual findings and substitute the federal courts own opinions for the determination made on the scene by the trial judge. Pp.1418.
(2)The prosecution stated that it struck Gerardo O., a Hispanic man, because he had a poor grasp of English, his answers suggested an unwillingness to impose the death penalty, and he did not appear to get along with other jurors.  Each of these reasons was amply supported by the record, and there is no basis for finding that the absence of defense counsel affected the trial judges evaluation of the strike.  Ayala cannot establish that the exparte hearing actually prejudiced him or that no fairminded jurist could agree with the state courts application of Chapman.  Once again, the Ninth Circuits decision was based on a misapplication of basic rules regarding harmless error.  The inquiry is not whether the federal habeas court could definitively say that the defense could make no winning arguments, but whether the evidence in the record raised grave doubt[s] about whether the trial judge would have ruled differently.  ONeal v. McAninch,

513 U. S. 432
.  That standard was not met in this case.  Pp.1824.
(3)The prosecution stated that it struck Robert M., a Hispanic man, because it was concerned that he could not impose the death penalty and because he had followed a controversial murder trial.  Not only was the Ninth Circuit incorrect to suppose that the presence of Ayalas counsel at the hearing would have made a difference in the trial courts evaluation of the strike, but the Ninth Circuit failed to mention that defense counsel specifically addressed the issue during voirdire and reminded the judge that Robert M. also made several statements favorable to the death penalty.  Thus, the trial judge heard counsels arguments and concluded that the record supplied a legitimate basis for the prosecutions concern.  That defense counsel did not have the opportunity to repeat that argument does not create grave doubt about whether the trial court would have decided the issue differently.  Pp. 2426.
(4)With regard to Ayalas Batson objection about the four remaining prospective jurors who were struck, he does not come close to establishing actual prejudice under Brecht or that no fairminded jurist could agree with the California Supreme Courts decision that excluding counsel was harmless.  Pp. 2628.
756 F.3d 656, reversed and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., and Thomas, J., filed concurring opinions.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

BRUMFIELD v. CAIN, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 131433.Argued March 30, 2015 Decided June 18, 2015
Petitioner Kevan Brumfield was convicted of murder in a Louisiana court and sentenced to death before this Court held that the
 
Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of the intellectually disabled, Atkins v. Virginia,

536 U.S. 304
.  Implementing Atkins mandate, see id., at 317, the Louisiana Supreme Court determined that an evidentiary hearing is required when a defendant provide[s] objective factors sufficient to raise a a reasonable ground to believe that he has an intellectual disability, which the court defined as (1) subaverage intelligence, as measured by objective standardized IQ tests; (2) significant impairment in several areas of adaptive skills; and (3) manifestations of this neuro-psychological disorder in the developmental stage.  State v. Williams, 20011650 (La. 11/1/02), 831 So. 2d 835, 857, 861, 854.
Soon after the Williams decision, Brumfield amended his pending state postconviction petition to raise an Atkins claim.  Seeking an evidentiary hearing, he pointed to evidence introduced at sentencing that he had an IQ of 75, had a fourth-grade reading level, had been prescribed numerous medications and treated at psychiatric hospitals as a child, had been identified as having a learning disability, and had been placed in special education classes.  The trial court dismissed Brumfields petition without holding a hearing or granting funds to conduct additional investigation.  Brumfield subsequently sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court found that the state courts rejection of Brumfields claim was both contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by this Court and based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.  28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), (2).  The court went on to determine that Brumfield was intellectually disabled.  The Fifth Circuit found that Brumfields petition failed to satisfy either of 2254(d)s requirements and reversed.
Held:Because Brumfield satisfied 2254(d)(2)s requirements, he was entitled to have his Atkins claim considered on the merits in federal court.  Pp.619.
(a)The two underlying factual determinations on which the state trial courts decision was premisedthat Brumfields IQ score was inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability and that he presented no evidence of adaptive impairmentwere unreasonable under 2254(d)(2).  Because that standard is satisfied, the Court need not address 2254(d)(1).  Pp.617.
(1)Expert trial testimony that Brumfield scored a 75 on an IQ test is entirely consistent with intellectual disability.  Every IQ score has a margin of error.  Accounting for that margin of error, the sources on which the Williams court relied in defining subaverage intelligence describe a score of 75 as consistent with an intellectual disability diagnosis.  There was no evidence presented to the trial court of any other IQ test that was sufficiently rigorous to preclude the possibility that Brumfield possessed subaverage intelligence.  Pp.811.
(2)The state-court record contains sufficient evidence to suggest that Brumfield would meet the criteria for adaptive impairment.  Under the test most favorable to the State, an individual like Brumfield must show a substantial functional limitation in three of six areas of major life activity.  Williams, 831 So.2d, at 854.  Brumfieldwho was placed in special education classes at an early age, was suspected of having a learning disability, and can barely read at a fourth-grade levelwould seem to be deficient in two of those areas: [u]nderstanding and use of language and [l]earning.  Ibid.  His low birth weight, his commitment to mental health facilities at a young age, and officials administration of antipsychotic and sedative drugs to him at that time all indicate that he may well have had significant deficits in at least one of the remaining four areas.  In light of that evidence, the fact that the record contains some contrary evidence cannot be said to foreclose all reasonable doubt as to his intellectual disability.  And given that Brumfields trial occurred before Atkins, the trial court should have taken into account that the evidence before it was sought and introduced at a time when Brumfields intellectual disability was not at issue.  Pp.1117.
(b)The States two additional arguments are rejected.  Because the State did not press below the theory that 2254(e)(1) supplies the governing standard when evaluating whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied 2254(d)(2)s requirements, that issue is not addressed here.  And because the state trial court made no finding that Brumfield had failed to produce evidence suggesting he could meet the manifestations ... in the developmental stage requirement for intellectual disability, there is no determination on that point to which a federal court must defer in assessing whether Brumfield satisfied 2254(d).  In any event, the state court record contained ample evidence creating a reasonable doubt as to whether Brumfields disability manifested before adulthood.  Pp.1718.
744 F.3d 918, vacated and remanded.
Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in all but Part IC of which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., joined.

Held:Because Brumfield satisfied 2254(d)(2)s requirements, he was entitled to have his Atkins claim considered on the merits in federal court.  Pp.619.
(a)The two underlying factual determinations on which the state trial courts decision was premisedthat Brumfields IQ score was inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability and that he presented no evidence of adaptive impairmentwere unreasonable under 2254(d)(2).  Because that standard is satisfied, the Court need not address 2254(d)(1).  Pp.617.
(1)Expert trial testimony that Brumfield scored a 75 on an IQ test is entirely consistent with intellectual disability.  Every IQ score has a margin of error.  Accounting for that margin of error, the sources on which the Williams court relied in defining subaverage intelligence describe a score of 75 as consistent with an intellectual disability diagnosis.  There was no evidence presented to the trial court of any other IQ test that was sufficiently rigorous to preclude the possibility that Brumfield possessed subaverage intelligence.  Pp.811.
(2)The state-court record contains sufficient evidence to suggest that Brumfield would meet the criteria for adaptive impairment.  Under the test most favorable to the State, an individual like Brumfield must show a substantial functional limitation in three of six areas of major life activity.  Williams, 831 So.2d, at 854.  Brumfieldwho was placed in special education classes at an early age, was suspected of having a learning disability, and can barely read at a fourth-grade levelwould seem to be deficient in two of those areas: [u]nderstanding and use of language and [l]earning.  Ibid.  His low birth weight, his commitment to mental health facilities at a young age, and officials administration of antipsychotic and sedative drugs to him at that time all indicate that he may well have had significant deficits in at least one of the remaining four areas.  In light of that evidence, the fact that the record contains some contrary evidence cannot be said to foreclose all reasonable doubt as to his intellectual disability.  And given that Brumfields trial occurred before Atkins, the trial court should have taken into account that the evidence before it was sought and introduced at a time when Brumfields intellectual disability was not at issue.  Pp.1117.
(b)The States two additional arguments are rejected.  Because the State did not press below the theory that 2254(e)(1) supplies the governing standard when evaluating whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied 2254(d)(2)s requirements, that issue is not addressed here.  And because the state trial court made no finding that Brumfield had failed to produce evidence suggesting he could meet the manifestations ... in the developmental stage requirement for intellectual disability, there is no determination on that point to which a federal court must defer in assessing whether Brumfield satisfied 2254(d).  In any event, the state court record contained ample evidence creating a reasonable doubt as to whether Brumfields disability manifested before adulthood.  Pp.1718.
744 F.3d 918, vacated and remanded.
Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in all but Part IC of which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Alito, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., joined."|"
			Brumfield was convicted of murder in a Louisiana court and sentenced to death before the Supreme Court held, in Atkins v. Virginia, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of the intellectually disabled. The Louisiana Supreme Court subsequent determined that an evidentiary hearing is required when a defendant provides objective factors sufficient to raise a a reasonable ground to believe that he has an intellectual disability, defined as (1) subaverage intelligence, as measured by objective standardized IQ tests; (2) significant impairment in several areas of adaptive skills; and (3) manifestations of this neuro-psychological disorder in the developmental stage. Brumfield amended his pending state post-conviction petition to raise an Atkins claim. Seeking an evidentiary hearing, he pointed to evidence introduced at sentencing that he had an IQ of 75, had a fourth-grade reading level, had been prescribed numerous medications and treated at psychiatric hospitals as a child, had been identified as having a learning disability, and had been placed in special education classes. The trial court dismissed without holding a hearing or granting funds to conduct additional investigation. Brumfield sought federal habeas relief. The district court granted relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), (2). The Fifth Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded. The factual determinations underlying the state trial courts decisionthat Brumfields IQ score was inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability and that he presented no evidence of adaptive impairmentwere unreasonable under section 2254(d)(2). The fact that the record contains some contrary evidence cannot be said to foreclose all reasonable doubt as to his intellectual disability. The trial court should have taken into account that the evidence was introduced before Brumfields intellectual disability was at issue.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
REED etal. v. TOWN OF GILBERT, ARIZONA, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13502.Argued January 12, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
Gilbert, Arizona (Town), has a comprehensive code (Sign Code or Code) that prohibits the display of outdoor signs without a permit, but exempts 23 categories of signs, including three relevant here.  Ideological Signs, defined as signs communicating a message or ideas that do not fit in any other Sign Code category, may be up to 20 square feet and have no placement or time restrictions.  Political Signs, defined as signs designed to influence the outcome of an election, may be up to 32 square feet and may only be displayed during an election season.  Temporary Directional Signs, defined as signs directing the public to a church or other qualifying event, have even greater restrictions: No more than four of the signs, limited to six square feet, may be on a single property at any time, and signs may be displayed no more than 12 hours before the qualifying event and 1 hour after. 
Petitioners, Good News Community Church (Church) and its pastor, Clyde Reed, whose Sunday church services are held at various temporary locations in and near the Town, posted signs early each Saturday bearing the Church name and the time and location of the next service and did not remove the signs until around midday Sunday.  The Church was cited for exceeding the time limits for displaying temporary directional signs and for failing to include an event date on the signs.  Unable to reach an accommodation with the Town, petitioners filed suit, claiming that the Code abridged their freedom of speech.  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, ultimately concluding that the Codes sign categories were content neutral, and that the Code satisfied the intermediate scrutiny accorded to content-neutral regulations of speech.
Held:The Sign Codes provisions are content-based regulations of speech that do not survive strict scrutiny.  Pp.617.
(a)Because content-based laws target speech based on its communicative content, they are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.  E.g., R.A.V. v. St. Paul,

505 U.S. 377
.  Speech regulation is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.  E.g., Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., 564 U.S. ___, ______.  And courts are required to consider whether a regulation of speech on its face draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.  Id., at ___.  Whether laws define regulated speech by particular subject matter or by its function or purpose, they are subject to strict scrutiny.  The same is true for laws that, though facially content neutral, cannot be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, or were adopted by the government because of disagreement with the message conveyed.  Ward v. Rock Against Racism,

491 U.S. 781
.  Pp.67.
(b)The Sign Code is content based on its face.  It defines the categories of temporary, political, and ideological signs on the basis of their messages and then subjects each category to different restrictions.  The restrictions applied thus depend entirely on the signs communicative content.  Because the Code, on its face, is a content-based regulation of speech, there is no need to consider the governments justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.  Pp.7.
(c)None of the Ninth Circuits theories for its contrary holding is persuasive.  Its conclusion that the Towns regulation was not based on a disagreement with the message conveyed skips the crucial first step in the content-neutrality analysis: determining whether the law is content neutral on its face.  A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the governments benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of animus toward the ideas contained in the regulated speech.  Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.,

507 U.S. 410
.  Thus, an innocuous justification cannot transform a facially content-based law into one that is content neutral.  A court must evaluate each questionwhether a law is content based on its face and whether the purpose and justification for the law are content basedbefore concluding that a law is content neutral.  Ward does not require otherwise, for its framework applies only to a content-neutral statute.  
The Ninth Circuits conclusion that the Sign Code does not single out any idea or viewpoint for discrimination conflates two distinct but related limitations that the
 
First Amendment places on government regulation of speech.  Government discrimination among viewpoints is a more blatant and egregious form of content discrimination, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

515 U.S. 819
, but [t]he
 
First Amendments hostility to content-based regulation [also] extends ... to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic, Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Commn of N.Y.,

447 U.S. 530
.  The Sign Code, a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination, singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.
The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that the Sign Code was not content based because it made only speaker-based and event-based distinctions.  The Codes categories are not speaker-basedthe restrictions for political, ideological, and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them.  And even if the sign categories were speaker based, that would not automatically render the law content neutral.  Rather, laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislatures speaker preference reflects a content preference.  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,

512 U.S. 622
.  This same analysis applies to event-based distinctions.  Pp.814.
(d)The Sign Codes content-based restrictions do not survive strict scrutiny because the Town has not demonstrated that the Codes differentiation between temporary directional signs and other types of signs furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.  See Arizona Free Enterprise Clubs Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  Assuming that the Town has a compelling interest in preserving its aesthetic appeal and traffic safety, the Codes distinctions are highly underinclusive.  The Town cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to beautify the Town when other types of signs create the same problem.  See Discovery Network, supra, at 425.  Nor has it shown that temporary directional signs pose a greater threat to public safety than ideological or political signs.  Pp.1415.
(e)This decision will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws.  The Town has ample content-neutral options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics, including regulating size, building materials, lighting, moving parts, and portability.  And the Town may be able to forbid postings on public property, so long as it does so in an evenhanded, content-neutral manner.  See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,

466 U.S. 789
.  An ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and passengerse.g., warning signs marking hazards on private property or signs directing trafficmight also survive strict scrutiny.  Pp.1617.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
WALKER, CHAIRMAN, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES BOARD, etal. v. TEXAS DIVISION, SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14144.Argued March 23, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
Texas offers automobile owners a choice between general-issue and specialty license plates.  Those who want the State to issue a particular specialty plate may propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or both.  If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board approves the design, the State will make it available for display on vehicles registered in Texas.  Here, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and its officers (collectively SCV) filed suit against the Chairman and members of the Board (collectively Board), arguing that the Boards rejection of SCVs proposal for a specialty plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag violated the Free Speech Clause.  The District Court entered judgment for the Board, but the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Texass specialty license plate designs are private speech and that the Board engaged in constitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination when it refused to approve SCVs design.
Held:Texass specialty license plate designs constitute government speech, and thus Texas was entitled to refuse to issue plates featuring SCVs proposed design.  Pp.518.
(a)When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it says.  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,

555 U.S. 460
468.  A government is generally entitled to promote a program, espouse a policy, or take a position.  Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, it is not easy to imagine how government would function.  Id., at 468.  That is not to say that a governments ability to express itself is without restriction.  Constitutional and statutory provisions outside of the Free Speech Clause may limit government speech, and the Free Speech Clause itself may constrain the governments speech if, for example, the government seeks to compel private persons to convey the governments speech.  Pp.56. 
(b)This Courts precedents regarding government speech provide the appropriate framework through which to approach the case.  Pp.617.
(1)The same analysis the Court used in Summumto conclude that a city accepting a privately donated monument and placing it on city property was engaging in government speech, 555 U.S., at 464leads to the conclusion that government speech is at issue here.  First, history shows that States, including Texas, have long used license plates to convey government speech, e.g., slogans urging action, promoting tourism, and touting local industries.  Cf. id., at 470.  Second, Texas license plate designs are often closely identified in the public mind with the [State].  Id., at 472.  Each plate is a government article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification.  The governmental nature of the plates is clear from their faces: the State places the name TEXAS in large letters across the top of every plate.  Texas also requires Texas vehicle owners to display license plates, issues every Texas plate, and owns all of the designs on its plates.  The plates are, essentially, government IDs, and ID issuers typically do not permit their IDs to contain message[s] with which they do not wish to be associated, id., at 471.  Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates, by giving the Board final approval over each design.  Like the city government in Summum, Texas has effectively controlled the messages [conveyed] by exercising final approval authority over their selection.  Id., at 473.  These considerations, taken together, show that Texass specialty plates are similar enough to the monuments in Summum to call for the same result.  Pp.712.
(2)Forum analysis, which applies to government restrictions on purely private speech occurring on government property, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc.,

473 U.S. 788
, is not appropriate when the State is speaking on its own behalf.  The parties agree that Texass specialty license plates are not a traditional public forum.  Further, Texass policies and the nature of its license plates indicate that the State did not intend its specialty plates to serve as either a designated public forumwhere government property ... not traditionally ... a public forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose, Summum, supra, at 469or a limited public forumwhere a government reserv[es a forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

515 U.S. 819
.  The State exercises final authority over the messages that may be conveyed by its specialty plates, it takes ownership of each specialty plate design, and it has traditionally used its plates for government speech.  These features of Texas specialty plates militate against a determination that Texas has created a public forum.  Finally, the plates are not a nonpublic forum, where the government is ... a proprietor, managing its internal operations.  International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,

505 U.S. 672
679.  The fact that private parties take part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish the governmental nature of the message or transform the governments role into that of a mere forum provider.  See Summum, supra, at 470471.  Nor does Texass requirement that vehicle owners pay annual fees for specialty plates mean that the plates are a forum for private speech.  And this case does not resemble other nonpublic forum cases.  Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn.,

460 U.S. 37
49; Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 

418 U.S. 298
; and Cornelius, supra, at 804806, distinguished.  Pp.1317.
(c)The determination that Texass specialty license plate designs are government speech does not mean that the designs do not also implicate the free speech rights of private persons.  The Court has acknowledged that drivers who display a States selected license plate designs convey the messages communicated through those designs.  See Wooley v. Maynard,

430 U.S. 705
, n.15.  The Court has also recognized that the
 
First Amendment stringently limits a States authority to compel a private party to express a view with which the private party disagrees.  Just as Texas cannot require SCV to convey the States ideological message, id., at 715, SCV cannot force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty license plates.  Pp.1718.
759 F.3d 388, reversed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Thomas, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined.

Each plate is a government article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification.  The governmental nature of the plates is clear from their faces: the State places the name TEXAS in large letters across the top of every plate.  Texas also requires Texas vehicle owners to display license plates, issues every Texas plate, and owns all of the designs on its plates.  The plates are, essentially, government IDs, and ID issuers typically do not permit their IDs to contain message[s] with which they do not wish to be associated, id., at 471.  Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates, by giving the Board final approval over each design.  Like the city government in Summum, Texas has effectively controlled the messages [conveyed] by exercising final approval authority over their selection.  Id., at 473.  These considerations, taken together, show that Texass specialty plates are similar enough to the monuments in Summum to call for the same result.  Pp.712.
(2)Forum analysis, which applies to government restrictions on purely private speech occurring on government property, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc.,

473 U.S. 788
, is not appropriate when the State is speaking on its own behalf.  The parties agree that Texass specialty license plates are not a traditional public forum.  Further, Texass policies and the nature of its license plates indicate that the State did not intend its specialty plates to serve as either a designated public forumwhere government property ... not traditionally ... a public forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose, Summum, supra, at 469or a limited public forumwhere a government reserv[es a forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

515 U.S. 819
.  The State exercises final authority over the messages that may be conveyed by its specialty plates, it takes ownership of each specialty plate design, and it has traditionally used its plates for government speech.  These features of Texas specialty plates militate against a determination that Texas has created a public forum.  Finally, the plates are not a nonpublic forum, where the government is ... a proprietor, managing its internal operations.  International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,

505 U.S. 672
679.  The fact that private parties take part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish the governmental nature of the message or transform the governments role into that of a mere forum provider.  See Summum, supra, at 470471.  Nor does Texass requirement that vehicle owners pay annual fees for specialty plates mean that the plates are a forum for private speech.  And this case does not resemble other nonpublic forum cases.  Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn.,

460 U.S. 37
49; Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 

418 U.S. 298
; and Cornelius, supra, at 804806, distinguished.  Pp.1317.
(c)The determination that Texass specialty license plate designs are government speech does not mean that the designs do not also implicate the free speech rights of private persons.  The Court has acknowledged that drivers who display a States selected license plate designs convey the messages communicated through those designs.  See Wooley v. Maynard,

430 U.S. 705
, n.15.  The Court has also recognized that the
 
First Amendment stringently limits a States authority to compel a private party to express a view with which the private party disagrees.  Just as Texas cannot require SCV to convey the States ideological message, id., at 715, SCV cannot force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty license plates.  Pp.1718.
759 F.3d 388, reversed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Thomas, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined.

			Texas automobile owners can choose between general-issue and specialty license plates. People can propose a specialty plate design, with a slogan, a graphic, or both. If the Department of Motor Vehicles Board approves the design, the state makes it available. The Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) claimed that rejection of SCVs proposal for a specialty plate design featuring a Confederate flag violated the Free Speech Clause. The Fifth Circuit held that Texass specialty license plate designs were private speech and that the Board engaged in constitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination. The Supreme Court reversed. Texass specialty license plate designs constitute government speech. When government speaks, it is not barred from determining the content of what it says; it is generally entitled to promote a program, espouse a policy, or take a position. States have long used license plates to convey government speech, e.g., slogans urging action and touting local industries and license plate designs are often closely identified in the public mind with the state. Plates serve the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification and are, essentially, government IDs. Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates. Forum analysis, which applies to government restrictions on purely private speech occurring on government property, is not appropriate when the state is speaking on its own behalf. That private parties take part in the design and pay for specialty plates does not transform the governments role into that of a mere forum provider. The Court acknowledged that the First Amendment stringently limits state authority to compel a private party to express a view with which the private party disagrees. Just as Texas cannot require SCV to convey the states ideological message, SCV cannot dictate design.

Syllabus
McFADDEN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 14378.Argued April 21, 2015Decided June 18, 2015
Petitioner McFadden was arrested and charged with distributing controlled substance analogues in violation of the federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (Analogue Act), which identifies a category of substances substantially similar to those listed on the federal controlled substances schedules,

21 U.S.C. 802(32)(A), and instructs courts to treat those analogues as schedule I controlled substances if they are intended for human consumption, 813.  Arguing that he did not know the bath salts he was distributing were regulated as controlled substance analogues, McFadden sought an instruction that would have prevented the jury from finding him guilty unless it found that he knew the substances he distributed had chemical structures and effects on the central nervous system substantially similar to those of controlled substances.  Instead, the District Court instructed the jury that it need only find that McFadden knowingly and intentionally distributed a substance with substantially similar effects on the central nervous system as a controlled substance and that he intended that substance to be consumed by humans.  McFadden was convicted.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Analogue Acts intent element required only proof that McFadden intended the substance to be consumed by humans.
Held:When a controlled substance is an analogue, 841(a)(1) requires the Government to establish that the defendant knew he was dealing with a substance regulated under the Controlled Substances Act or Analogue Act.  Pp.411.
(a)In addressing the treatment of controlled substance analogues under federal law, one must look to the CSA, which, as relevant here, makes it unlawful for any person knowingly ... to distribute ... a controlled substance.  841(a)(1).  The ordinary meaning of that provision requires a defendant to know only that the substance he is distributing is some unspecified substance listed on the federal drug schedules.  Thus, the Government must show either that the defendant knew he was distributing a substance listed on the schedules, even if he did not know which substance it was, or that the defendant knew the identity of the substance he was distributing, even if he did not know it was listed on the schedules.
Because the Analogue Act extends that framework to analogous substances, the CSAs mental-state requirement applies when the controlled substance is, in fact, an analogue.  It follows that the Government must prove that a defendant knew that the substance he was distributing was a controlled substance, even in prosecutions dealing with analogues.  That knowledge requirement can be established in two ways: by evidence that a defendant knew that the substance he was distributing is controlled under the CSA or Analogue Act, regardless of whether he knew the substances identity; or by evidence that the defendant knew the specific analogue he was distributing, even if he did not know its legal status as a controlled substance analogue.  A defendant with knowledge of the features defining a substance as a controlled substance analogue, 802(32)(A), knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal.  Pp.48.
(b)The Fourth Circuit did not adhere to 813s command to treat a controlled substance analogue as a controlled substance listed in schedule I by applying 841(a)(1)s mental-state requirement.  Instead, it concluded that the only mental-state requirement for analogue prosecutions is the one in 813that an analogue be intended for human consumption.  That conclusion is inconsistent with the text and structure of the statutes.
Neither the Governments nor McFaddens interpretation fares any better.  The Governments contention that 841(a)(1)s knowledge requirement as applied to analogues is satisfied if the defendant knew he was dealing with a substance regulated under some law ignores 841(a)(1)s requirement that a defendant know he was dealing with a controlled substance.  That term includes only drugs listed on the federal drug schedules or treated as such by operation of the Analogue Act; it is not broad enough to include all substances regulated by any law.  McFadden contends that a defendant must also know the substances features that cause it to fall within the scope of the Analogue Act.  But the key fact that brings a substance within the scope of the Analogue Act is that the substance is controlled, and that fact can be established in the two ways previously identified.  Staples v. United States,

511 U.S. 600
, distinguished.  Contrary to McFaddens submission, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the interpretation of an unambiguous statute such as this one.  Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. ___, ___.  But even if the statute were ambiguous, the scienter requirement adopted here alleviate[s] vagueness concerns under this Courts precedents.  Gonzales v. Carhart,

550 U.S. 124
.  Pp.810.
(c)The Government argues that no rational jury could have concluded that McFadden was unaware that the substances he was distributing were controlled under the CSA or Analogue Act and that any error in the jury instruction was therefore harmless.  The Fourth Circuit, which did not conduct a harmless-error analysis, is to consider that issue in the first instance.  Pp.1011.
753 F.3d 432, vacated and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Roberts, C.J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE, etal.  v. DIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131402.Argued February 23, 2015Decided June 15, 2015
Respondent Fauzia Din petitioned to have her husband, Kanishka Berashk, a resident citizen of Afghanistan and former civil servant in the Taliban regime, classified as an immediate relative entitled to priority immigration status.  Dins petition was approved, but Berashks visa application was ultimately denied.  A consular officer informed Berashk that he was inadmissible under 1182(a)(3)(B), which excludes aliens who have engaged in [t]errorist activities, but the officer provided no further information.  Unable to obtain a more detailed explanation for Berashks visa denial, Din filed suit in Federal District Court, which dismissed her complaint.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Din had a protected liberty interest in her marriage that entitled her to review of the denial of Berashks visa.  It further held that the Government deprived her of that liberty interest without due process when it denied Berashks visa application without providing a more detailed explanation of its reasons. 
Held:The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Government did not deprive Din of any constitutional right entitling her to due process of law.  Pp.315.

(b)Even accepting the textually unsupportable doctrine of implied fundamental rights, nothing in that line of cases establishes a free-floating and categorical liberty interest sufficient to trigger constitutional protection whenever a regulation touches upon any aspect of the marital relationship.

BAKER BOTTS L.L.P. etal. v. ASARCO LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14103.Argued February 25, 2015Decided June 15, 2015
Respondent ASARCO LLC hired petitioner law firms pursuant to 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to assist it in carrying out its duties as a Chapter 11 debtor in possession.  See

11 U.S.C. 327(a).  When ASARCO emerged from bankruptcy, the law firms filed fee applications requesting fees under 330(a)(1), which permits bankruptcy courts to award ... reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by 327(a) professionals.  ASARCO challenged the applications, but the Bankruptcy Court rejected ASARCOs objections and awarded the law firms fees for time spent defending the applications.  ASARCO appealed to the District Court, which held that the law firms could be awarded fees for defending their fee applications.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that 330(a)(1) did not authorize fee awards for defending fee applications.
Held:Section 330(a)(1) does not permit bankruptcy courts to award fees to 327(a) professionals for defending fee applications.  Pp.313.
(a)The American Rule provides the basic point of reference for awards of attorneys fees: Each litigant pays his own attorneys fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.  Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,

560 U.S. 242
253.  Because the rule is deeply rooted in the common law, see, e.g., Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306, this Court will not deviate from it absent explicit statutory authority, Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,

532 U.S. 598
.  Departures from the American Rule have been recognized only in specific and explicit provisions, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,

421 U.S. 240
, usually containing language that authorizes the award of a reasonable attorneys fee, fees, or litigation costs, and referring to a prevailing party in the context of an adversarial action, see generally Hardt, supra, at 253, and nn. 37.  Pp.34.
(b)Congress did not depart from the American Rule in 330(a)(1) for fee-defense litigation.  Section 327(a) professionals are hired to serve an estates administrator for the benefit of the estate, and 330(a)(1) authorizes reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered.  The word services ordinarily refers to labor performed for another, Websters New International Dictionary 2288.  Thus, the phrase reasonable compensation for services rendered necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of a client, Woods v. City Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago,

BAKER BOTTS L.L.P. etal. v. ASARCO LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14103.Argued February 25, 2015Decided June 15, 2015
Respondent ASARCO LLC hired petitioner law firms pursuant to 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to assist it in carrying out its duties as a Chapter 11 debtor in possession.  See

11 U.S.C. 327(a).  When ASARCO emerged from bankruptcy, the law firms filed fee applications requesting fees under 330(a)(1), which permits bankruptcy courts to award ... reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by 327(a) professionals.  ASARCO challenged the applications, but the Bankruptcy Court rejected ASARCOs objections and awarded the law firms fees for time spent defending the applications.  ASARCO appealed to the District Court, which held that the law firms could be awarded fees for defending their fee applications.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that 330(a)(1) did not authorize fee awards for defending fee applications.
Held:Section 330(a)(1) does not permit bankruptcy courts to award fees to 327(a) professionals for defending fee applications.  Pp.313.
(a)The American Rule provides the basic point of reference for awards of attorneys fees: Each litigant pays his own attorneys fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.  Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,

560 U.S. 242
253.  Because the rule is deeply rooted in the common law, see, e.g., Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306, this Court will not deviate from it absent explicit statutory authority, Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,

532 U.S. 598
.  Departures from the American Rule have been recognized only in specific and explicit provisions, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,

421 U.S. 240
, usually containing language that authorizes the award of a reasonable attorneys fee, fees, or litigation costs, and referring to a prevailing party in the context of an adversarial action, see generally Hardt, supra, at 253, and nn. 37.  Pp.34.
(b)Congress did not depart from the American Rule in 330(a)(1) for fee-defense litigation.  Section 327(a) professionals are hired to serve an estates administrator for the benefit of the estate, and 330(a)(1) authorizes reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered.  The word services ordinarily refers to labor performed for another, Websters New International Dictionary 2288.  Thus, the phrase reasonable compensation for services rendered necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of a client, Woods v. City Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago,

312 U.S. 262

REYES MATA v. LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14185.Argued April 29, 2015Decided June 15, 2015
After petitioner Noel Reyes Mata, an unlawful resident alien, was convicted of assault in a Texas court, an Immigration Judge ordered him removed to Mexico.  Matas attorney filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board), but never filed a brief, and the appeal was dismissed.  Acting through different counsel, Mata filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings, as authorized by statute.  See

8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(7)(A).  Acknowledging that he had missed the 90-day deadline for such motions, see 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), Mata argued that his previous counsels ineffective assistance was an exceptional circumstance entitling him to equitable tolling of the time limit.  But the BIA disagreed and dismissed the motion as untimely.  The BIA also declined to reopen Matas removal proceedings sua sponte based on its separate regulatory authority.  See 8 CFR 1003.2(a).  On appeal, the Fifth Circuit construed Matas equitable tolling claim as an invitation for the Board to exercise its regulatory authority to reopen the proceedings sua sponte, andbecause circuit precedent forbids the court to review BIA decisions not to exercise that authoritydismissed Matas appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
Held:The Fifth Circuit erred in declining to take jurisdiction over Matas appeal.  A court of appeals has jurisdiction to review the BIAs rejection of an aliens motion to reopen.  Kucana v. Holder,

558 U.S. 233
.  Nothing about that jurisdiction changes where the Board rejects a motion as untimely, or when it rejects a motion requesting equitable tolling of the time limit.  That jurisdiction likewise remains unchanged if the BIAs denial also contains a separate decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority.  So even assuming the Fifth Circuit is correct that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review BIA decisions not to reopen cases sua sponte, that lack of jurisdiction does not affect jurisdiction over the decision on the aliens motion to reopen.  It thus follows that the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over this case.
The Fifth Circuits contrary decision rested on its construing Matas motion as an invitation for the Board to exercise its sua sponte discretion.  Court-appointed amicus asserts that the Fifth Circuits recharacterization was based on the premise that equitable tolling in Matas situation is categorically forbidden.  In amicuss view, the courts construal was therefore an example of the ordinary practice of recharacterizing a doomed request as one for relief that may be available.  But even if equitable tolling is prohibited, the Fifth Circuits action was not justified.  If Mata is not entitled to relief on the merits, then the correct disposition is to take jurisdiction and affirm the BIAs denial of his motion.  For a court retains jurisdiction even if a litigants request for relief lacks merit, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,

523 U.S. 83
, and a federal court has a virtually unflagging obligation, Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,

424 U.S. 800
, to assert jurisdiction where it has that authority.  Nor can the established practice of recharacterizing pleadings so as to offer the possibility of relief justify an approach that, as here, renders relief impossible and sidesteps the judicial obligation to assert jurisdiction.  Pp.48.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
zivotofsky, by his parents and guardians, zivotofsky et ux. v. kerry, secretary of state
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 13628.Argued November 3, 2014Decided June 8, 2015
Petitioner Zivotofsky was born to UnitedStates citizens living in Jerusalem.  Pursuant to 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, his mother asked American Embassy officials to list his place of birth as Israel on, inter alia, his passport.  Section 214(d) states for purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizens legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.  The Embassy officials refused to list Zivotofskys place of birth as Israel on his passport, citing the Executive Branchs longstanding position that the United States does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem.  Zivotofskys parents brought suit on his behalf in federal court, seeking to enforce 214(d).  Ultimately, the D.C. Circuit held the statute unconstitutional, concluding that it contradicts the Executive Branchs exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns.
Held: 
1.The President has the exclusive power to grant formal recognition to a foreign sovereign.  Pp.626.
(a)Where, as here, the Presidents action is incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, the President can rely [for his authority] only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,

343 U.S. 579
 (Jackson, J., concurring).  His asserted power must be both exclusive and conclusive on the issue, id., at 637638, and he may rely solely on powers the Constitution grants to him alone, id., at 638.  To determine whether the Presidents power of recognition is exclusive, this Court examines the Constitutions text and structure and relevant precedent and history.  Pp.67.
(b)The Constitutions text and structure grant the President the power to recognize foreign nations and governments.  The Reception Clause directs that the President shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers, Art. II, 3.  And at the time of the founding, receiving an ambassador was considered tantamount to recognizing the sending states sovereignty.  It is thus logical and proper to infer that the Reception Clause would be understood to acknowledge the Presidents power to recognize other nations.  This inference is further supported by the Presidents additional Article II powers: to negotiate treaties and to nominate the Nations ambassadors and dispatch other diplomatic agents.  Though ratifying a treaty and confirming an ambassador require congressional approval, Congress lacks authority to initiate the actions without the Presidents involvement.  The President, unlike Congress, also has the power to open diplomatic channels simply by engaging in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers.  The Constitution thus assigns the President, not Congress, means to effect recognition on his own initiative. 
Functional considerations also suggest that the Presidents recognition power is exclusive.  The Nation must speak ... with one voice regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not, American Insurance Assn. v. Garamendi,

539 U.S. 396
, and only the Executive has the characteristic of unity at all times.  Unlike Congress, the President is also capable of engaging in the delicate and often secret diplomatic contacts that may lead to a recognition decision, see, e.g., United States v. Pink,

315 U.S. 203
, and is better positioned to take the decisive, unequivocal action necessary to recognize other states at international law.  The President has also exercised unilateral recognition power since the founding, a practice endorsed by this Court, see, e.g., Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,

376 U.S. 398
.
Under basic separation-of-powers principles, Congress, which has the central role in making laws, see Art. I, 8, cl.18, does have substantial authority regarding many policy determinations that precede and follow an act of recognition.  The Presidents recognition determination is thus only one part of a political process.  Pp.714.
(b)A fair reading of relevant precedent illustrates that this Court has long considered recognition to be the exclusive prerogative of the Executive.  See, e.g., Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420; United States v. Belmont, 

301 U.S. 324
; United States v. Pink, supra, at 229; Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, supra, at 410; National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China,

348 U.S. 356
.  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,

299 U.S. 304
, does not support a broader definition of the Executives power over foreign relations that would permit the President alone to determine the whole content of the Nations foreign policy.  The Executive is not free from the ordinary controls and checks of Congress merely because foreign affairs are at issue.  See, e.g., Medelln v. Texas,

552 U.S. 491
532.  Nonetheless, it is for the President alone to make the specific decision of what foreign power he will recognize as legitimate, and his position must be clear.  Pp.1420.
(c)The weight of historical evidence also indicates Congress has accepted that the recognition power is exclusive to the Presidency.  Cf. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. ___.  Since the first Administration, the President has claimed unilateral authority to recognize foreign sovereigns.  And Congress, for the most part, has acquiesced, generally respecting the Executives policies and positions on formal recognition and even defending the Presidents constitutional prerogative.  Pp.2026. 
2.Because the power to recognize foreign states resides in the President alone, 214(d) infringes on the Executives consistent decision to withhold recognition with respect to Jerusalem.  See Nixon v. Administrator of General Services,

433 U.S. 425
.  The provision forces the President, through the Secretary of State, to identify, upon request, citizens born in Jerusalem as being born in Israel when, as a matter of United States policy, neither Israel nor any other country is acknowledged as having sovereignty over Jerusalem.  
If the recognition power is to mean anything, it must mean that the President not only makes the initial, formal recognition determination but also may maintain that determination in his and his agents statements.  Under international law, recognition may be effected by written or oral declaration.  In addition, an act of recognition must leave no doubt as to the intention to grant it.  Thus, if Congress could alter the Presidents statements on matters of recognition or force him to contradict them, Congress in effect would exercise the recognition power.  An exclusive Presidential power disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject.  Youngstown, supra, at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).  If Congress may not pass a law, speaking in its own voice, effecting formal recognition, then it may not force the President, through 214(d), to contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State.  See Urtetiqui v. DArcy, 9 Pet. 692, 698.  
Section 214(d)s flaw is further underscored by the fact that the statutes purpose was to infringe on the Presidents exclusive recognition power.  While Congress may have power to enact passport legislation of wide scope, it may not aggrandiz[e] its power at the expense of another branch by requiring the President to contradict an earlier recognition determination in an official Executive Branch document.  Freytag v. Commissioner,

501 U.S. 868
.  Pp.2629. 
725 F.3d 197, affirmed.

(b)A fair reading of relevant precedent illustrates that this Court has long considered recognition to be the exclusive prerogative of the Executive.  See, e.g., Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420; United States v. Belmont, 

301 U.S. 324
; United States v. Pink, supra, at 229; Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, supra, at 410; National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China,

348 U.S. 356
.  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,

299 U.S. 304
, does not support a broader definition of the Executives power over foreign relations that would permit the President alone to determine the whole content of the Nations foreign policy.  The Executive is not free from the ordinary controls and checks of Congress merely because foreign affairs are at issue.  See, e.g., Medelln v. Texas,

552 U.S. 491
532.  Nonetheless, it is for the President alone to make the specific decision of what foreign power he will recognize as legitimate, and his position must be clear.  Pp.1420.
(c)The weight of historical evidence also indicates Congress has accepted that the recognition power is exclusive to the Presidency.  Cf. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. ___.  Since the first Administration, the President has claimed unilateral authority to recognize foreign sovereigns.  And Congress, for the most part, has acquiesced, generally respecting the Executives policies and positions on formal recognition and even defending the Presidents constitutional prerogative.  Pp.2026. 
2.Because the power to recognize foreign states resides in the President alone, 214(d) infringes on the Executives consistent decision to withhold recognition with respect to Jerusalem.  See Nixon v. Administrator of General Services,

433 U.S. 425
.  The provision forces the President, through the Secretary of State, to identify, upon request, citizens born in Jerusalem as being born in Israel when, as a matter of United States policy, neither Israel nor any other country is acknowledged as having sovereignty over Jerusalem.  
If the recognition power is to mean anything, it must mean that the President not only makes the initial, formal recognition determination but also may maintain that determination in his and his agents statements.  Under international law, recognition may be effected by written or oral declaration.  In addition, an act of recognition must leave no doubt as to the intention to grant it.  Thus, if Congress could alter the Presidents statements on matters of recognition or force him to contradict them, Congress in effect would exercise the recognition power.  An exclusive Presidential power disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject.  Youngstown, supra, at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).  If Congress may not pass a law, speaking in its own voice, effecting formal recognition, then it may not force the President, through 214(d), to contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State.  See Urtetiqui v. DArcy, 9 Pet. 692, 698.  
Section 214(d)s flaw is further underscored by the fact that the statutes purpose was to infringe on the Presidents exclusive recognition power.  While Congress may have power to enact passport legislation of wide scope, it may not aggrandiz[e] its power at the expense of another branch by requiring the President to contradict an earlier recognition determination in an official Executive Branch document.  Freytag v. Commissioner,

501 U.S. 868
.  Pp.2629. 
725 F.3d 197, affirmed.

			Zivotofsky was born to U.S. citizens living in Jerusalem. Under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 2003, 116 Stat. 1350, his mother asked Embassy officials to list his place of birth as Israel on his passport. Section 214(d) of the Act states for purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request  record the place of birth as Israel. Embassy officials refused to list Zivotofskys place of birth as Israel, citing the Executive Branchs position that the U.S. does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. The D. C. Circuit held the statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court affirmed.  The President has the exclusive power to grant formal recognition to a foreign sovereign. The Court cited the Reception Clause, which directs that the President shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers, and the Presidents additional Article II powers, to negotiate treaties and to nominate the Nations ambassadors and dispatch other diplomatic agents. The Constitution assigns the President, not Congress, means to effect recognition on his own initiative. The Nation must speak . . . with one voice regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not, and only the Executive has the characteristic of unity at all times. If Congress may not pass a law, speaking in its own voice, effecting formal recognition, then it may not force the President, through section 214(d), to contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
MELLOULI v. LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 131034.Argued January 14, 2015Decided June 1, 2015
Petitioner Moones Mellouli, a lawful permanent resident, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense under Kansas law, the possession of drug paraphernalia to ... store [or] conceal ... a controlled substance.  Kan. Stat. Ann. 215709(b)(2).  The sole paraphernalia Mellouli was charged with possessing was a sock in which he had placed four unidentified orange tablets.  Citing Melloulis misdemeanor conviction, an Immigration Judge ordered him deported under

8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), which authorizes the deportation (removal) of an alien convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21).  Section 802, in turn, limits the term controlled substance to a drug or other substance included in one of five federal schedules.

21 U.S.C. 802(6).  Kansas defines controlled substance as any drug included on its own schedules, without reference to 802.  Kan. Stat. Ann. 215701(a).  At the time of Melloulis conviction, Kansas schedules included at least nine substances not on the federal lists.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed Melloulis deportation order, and the Eighth Circuit denied his petition for review.
Held:Melloulis Kansas conviction for concealing unnamed pills in his sock did not trigger removal under 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).  Pp.514.
(a)The categorical approach historically taken in determining whether a state conviction renders an alien removable looks to the statutory definition of the offense of conviction, not to the particulars of the aliens conduct.  The state conviction triggers removal only if, by definition, the underlying crime falls within a category of removable offenses defined by federal law.  The BIA has long applied the categorical approach to assess whether a state drug conviction triggers removal under successive versions of what is now 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).  Matter of Paulus, 11 I. & N. Dec. 274, is illustrative.  At the time the BIA decided Paulus, California controlled certain narcotics not listed as narcotic drugs under federal law.  Id., at 275.  The BIA concluded that an aliens California conviction for offering to sell an unidentified narcotic was not a deportable offense, for it was possible that the conviction involved a substance controlled only under California, not federal, law.  Under the Paulus analysis, Mellouli would not be deportable.  The state law involved in Melloulis conviction, like the California statute in Paulus, was not confined to federally controlled substances; it also included substances controlled only under state, not federal, law.
The BIA, however, announced and applied a different approach to drug-paraphernalia offenses (as distinguished from drug possession and distribution offenses) in Matter of Martinez Espinoza, 25 I. & N. Dec. 118.  There, the BIA ranked paraphernalia statutes as relating to the drug trade in general, reasoning that a paraphernalia conviction relates to any and all controlled substances, whether or not federally listed, with which the paraphernalia can be used.  Id., at 120121.  Under this reasoning, there is no need to show that the type of controlled substance involved in a paraphernalia conviction is one defined in 802.
The BIAs disparate approach to drug possession and distribution offenses and paraphernalia possession offenses finds no home in 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)s text and leads to consequences Congress could not have intended.  Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. ___, ___.  That approach has the anomalous result of treating less grave paraphernalia possession misdemeanors more harshly than drug possession and distribution offenses.  The incongruous upshot is that an alien is not removable for possessing a substance controlled only under Kansas law, but he is removable for using a sock to contain that substance.  Because it makes scant sense, the BIAs interpretation is owed no deference under the doctrine described in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837
.  Pp.511.
(b)The Governments interpretation of the statute is similarly flawed.  The Government argues that aliens who commit any drug crime, not just paraphernalia offenses, in States whose drug schedules substantially overlap the federal schedules are deportable, for state statutes that criminalize hundreds of federally controlled drugs and a handful of similar substances, are laws relating to federally controlled substances.  Brief for Respondent 17.  While the words relating to are broad, the Governments reading stretches the construction of 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) to the breaking point, reaching state-court convictions, like Melloulis, in which [no] controlled substance (as defined in [802]) figures as an element of the offense.  Construction of 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) must be faithful to the text, which limits the meaning of controlled substance, for removal purposes, to the substances controlled under 802.  Accordingly, to trigger removal under 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), the Government must connect an element of the aliens conviction to a drug defined in [802].  Pp.1114.

BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. v. CAULKETT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 131421.Argued March 24, 2015Decided June 1, 2015[1]
Respondent debtors each filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and each owned a house encumbered with a senior mortgage lien and a junior mortgage lien, the latter held by petitioner bank.  Because the amount owed on each senior mortgage is greater than each houses current market value, the bank would receive nothing if the properties were sold today.  The junior mortgage liens were thus wholly underwater.  The debtors sought to void their junior mortgage liens under 506 of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides, To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.

11 U.S.C. 506(d).  In each case, the Bankruptcy Court granted the motion, and both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:A debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding may not void a junior mortgage lien under 506(d) when the debt owed on a senior mortgage lien exceeds the current value of the collateral if the creditors claim is both secured by a lien and allowed under 502 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Pp.27.
(a)The debtors here prevail only if the banks claims are not ... allowed secured claim[s].  The parties do not dispute that the banks claims are allowed under the Code.  Instead, the debtors argue that the banks claims are not secured because 506(a)(1) provides that [a]n allowed claim ... is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditors interest in ... such property and an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditors interest ... is less than the amount of such allowed claim.  Because the value of the banks interest here is zero, a straightforward reading of the statute would seem to favor the debtors.  This Courts construction of 506(d)s term secured claim in Dewsnup v. Timm,

502 U.S. 410
, however, forecloses that reading and resolves the question presented here.  In declining to permit a Chapter 7 debtor to strip down a partially underwater lien under 506(d) to the value of the collateral, the Court in Dewsnup concluded that an allowed claim secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying collateral ... does not come within the scope of 506(d).  Id., at 415.  Thus, under Dewsnup, a secured claim is a claim supported by a security interest in property, regardless of whether the value of that property would be sufficient to cover the claim.  Pp.24.
(b)This Court declines to limit Dewsnup to partially underwater liens.  Dewsnups definition did not depend on such a distinction.  Nor is this distinction supported by Nobelman v. American Savings Bank,

508 U.S. 324
, which addressed the interaction between the meaning of the term secured claim in 506(a)a definition that Dewsnup declined to use for purposes of 506(d)and an entirely separate provision, 1322(b)(2).  See 508 U.S., at 327332.  Finally, the debtors suggestion that the historical and policy concerns that motivated the Court in Dewsnup do not apply in the context of wholly underwater liens is an insufficient justification for giving the term secured claim a different definition depending on the value of the collateral.  Ultimately, the debtors proposed distinction would do nothing to vindicate 506(d)s original meaning and would leave an odd statutory framework in its place.  Pp.57.

elonis v. united states
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 13983.Argued December 1, 2014Decided June 1, 2015
After his wife left him, petitioner Anthony Douglas Elonis, under the pseudonym Tone Dougie, used the social networking Web siteFacebook to post self-styled rap lyrics containing graphically violent language and imagery concerning his wife, co-workers, a kindergarten class, and state and federal law enforcement.  These posts were often interspersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were fictitious and not intended to depict real persons, and with statements that Elonis was exercising his
 
First Amendment rights.  Many who knew him saw his posts as threatening, however, including his boss, who fired him for threatening co-workers, and his wife, who sought and was granted a state court protection-from-abuse order against him.
When Eloniss former employer informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the posts, the agency began monitoring Eloniss Face-book activity and eventually arrested him.  He was charged with five counts of violating

18 U.S.C. 875(c), which makes it a federal crime to transmit in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat ... to injure the person of another.  At trial, Elonis requested a jury instruction that the Government was required to prove that he intended to communicate a true threat.  Instead, the District Court told the jury that Elonis could be found guilty if a reasonable person would foresee that his statements would be interpreted as a threat.  Elonis was convicted on four of the five counts and renewed his jury instruction challenge on appeal.  The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that Section 875(c) requires only the intent to communicate words that the defendant understands, and that a reasonable person would view as a threat.
Held:The Third Circuits instruction, requiring only negligence with respect to the communication of a threat, is not sufficient to support a conviction under Section 875(c).  Pp.717.
(a)Section 875(c) does not indicate whether the defendant must intend that the communication contain a threat, and the parties can show no indication of a particular mental state requirement in the statutes text.  Elonis claims that the word threat, by definition, conveys the intent to inflict harm.  But common definitions of threat speak to what the statement conveysnot to the authors mental state.  The Government argues that the express intent to extort requirements in neighboring Sections 875(b) and (d) should preclude courts from implying an unexpressed intent to threaten requirement in Section 875(c).  The most that can be concluded from such a comparison, however, is that Congress did not mean to confine Section 875(c) to crimes of extortion, not that it meant to exclude a mental state requirement.  Pp.79.
(b)The Court does not regard mere omission from a criminal enactment of any mention of criminal intent as dispensing with such a requirement.  Morissette v. United States,

342 U.S. 246
.  This rule of construction reflects the basic principle that wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal, and that a defendant must be blameworthy in mind before he can be found guilty.

elonis v. united states
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 13983.Argued December 1, 2014Decided June 1, 2015
After his wife left him, petitioner Anthony Douglas Elonis, under the pseudonym Tone Dougie, used the social networking Web siteFacebook to post self-styled rap lyrics containing graphically violent language and imagery concerning his wife, co-workers, a kindergarten class, and state and federal law enforcement.  These posts were often interspersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were fictitious and not intended to depict real persons, and with statements that Elonis was exercising his
 
First Amendment rights.  Many who knew him saw his posts as threatening, however, including his boss, who fired him for threatening co-workers, and his wife, who sought and was granted a state court protection-from-abuse order against him.
When Eloniss former employer informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the posts, the agency began monitoring Eloniss Face-book activity and eventually arrested him.  He was charged with five counts of violating

18 U.S.C. 875(c), which makes it a federal crime to transmit in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat ... to injure the person of another.  At trial, Elonis requested a jury instruction that the Government was required to prove that he intended to communicate a true threat.  Instead, the District Court told the jury that Elonis could be found guilty if a reasonable person would foresee that his statements would be interpreted as a threat.  Elonis was convicted on four of the five counts and renewed his jury instruction challenge on appeal.  The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that Section 875(c) requires only the intent to communicate words that the defendant understands, and that a reasonable person would view as a threat.
Held:The Third Circuits instruction, requiring only negligence with respect to the communication of a threat, is not sufficient to support a conviction under Section 875(c).  Pp.717.
(a)Section 875(c) does not indicate whether the defendant must intend that the communication contain a threat, and the parties can show no indication of a particular mental state requirement in the statutes text.  Elonis claims that the word threat, by definition, conveys the intent to inflict harm.  But common definitions of threat speak to what the statement conveysnot to the authors mental state.  The Government argues that the express intent to extort requirements in neighboring Sections 875(b) and (d) should preclude courts from implying an unexpressed intent to threaten requirement in Section 875(c).  The most that can be concluded from such a comparison, however, is that Congress did not mean to confine Section 875(c) to crimes of extortion, not that it meant to exclude a mental state requirement.  Pp.79.
(b)The Court does not regard mere omission from a criminal enactment of any mention of criminal intent as dispensing with such a requirement.  Morissette v. United States,

342 U.S. 246
.  This rule of construction reflects the basic principle that wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal, and that a defendant must be blameworthy in mind before he can be found guilty.  Id., at 252.  The general rule is that a guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime.  United States v. Balint,

258 U.S. 250
.  Thus, criminal statutes are generally interpreted to include broadly applicable scienter requirements, even where the statute ...does not contain them.  United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,

513 U.S. 64

			Elonis used the Web site Facebook to post lyrics containing graphically violent language and imagery concerning his wife, co-workers, children, and law enforcement, interspersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were fictitious and that Elonis was exercising his First Amendment rights.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION v. ABERCROMBIE & FITCH STORES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 1486.Argued February 25, 2015Decided June 1, 2015
Respondent (Abercrombie) refused to hire Samantha Elauf, a practicing Muslim, because the headscarf that she wore pursuant to her religious obligations conflicted with Abercrombies employee dress policy.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit on Elaufs behalf, alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, inter alia, prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant because of the applicants religious practice when the practice could be accommodated without undue hardship.  The EEOC prevailed in the District Court, but the Tenth Circuit reversed, awarding Abercrombie summary judgment on the ground that failure-to-accommodate liability attaches only when the applicant provides the employer with actual knowledge of his need for an accommodation.
Held:To prevail in a disparate-treatment claim, an applicant need show only that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employers decision, not that the employer had knowledge of his need.  Title VIIs disparate-treatment provision requires Elauf to show that Abercrombie (1) fail[ed] ... to hire her (2) because of (3) [her] religion (including a religious practice).

42 U.S.C. 2000e2(a)(1).  And its because of standard is understood to mean that the protected characteristic cannot be a motivating factor in an employment decision.  2000e2(m).  Thus, rather than imposing a knowledge standard, 2000e2(a)(1) prohibits certain motives, regardless of the state of the actors knowledge: An employer may not make an applicants religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions.  Title VII contains no knowledge requirement.  Furthermore, Title VIIs definition of religion clearly indicates that failure-to-accommodate challenges can be brought as disparate-treatment claims.  And Title VII gives favored treatment to religious practices, rather than demanding that religious practices be treated no worse than other practices.  Pp.27.

14-939|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
STANLEY TAYLOR, etal. v. KAREN BARKES, etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 14939.Decided June 1, 2015

Per Curiam.
Christopher Barkes, a troubled man with a long history of mental health and substance abuse problems, was arrested on November 13, 2004, for violating his probation.  Barkes v. First Correctional Medical, Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 310311 (CA3 2014).  Barkes was taken to the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware.  As part of Barkess intake, a nurse who worked for the contractor providing healthcare at the Institution conducted a medical evaluation.  Id., at 311.
The evaluation included a mental health screening designed in part to assess whether an inmate was suicidal.  The nurse employed a suicide screening form based on a model form developed by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) in 1997.  The form listed 17 suicide risk factors.  If the inmates responses and nurses observations indicated that at least eight were present, or if certain serious risk factors were present, the nurse would notify a physician and initiate suicide prevention measures.  Id., at 311, 313.
Barkes disclosed that he had a history of psychiatric treatment and was on medication.  He also disclosed that he had attempted suicide in 2003, though notas far as the record indicatesthat he had also done so on three other occasions.  And he indicated that he was not cur-rently thinking about killing himself.  Because only two risk factors were apparent, the nurse gave Barkes a routine referral to mental health services and did not initiate any special suicide prevention measures.  Id., at 311.
Barkes was placed in a cell by himself.  Despite what he had told the nurse, that evening he called his wife and told her that he cant live this way anymore and was going to kill himself.  Barkess wife did not inform anyone at the Institution of this call.  The next morning, correctional officers observed Barkes awake and behaving normally at 10:45, 10:50, and 11:00 a.m.  At 11:35 a.m., however, an officer arrived to deliver lunch and discovered that Barkes had hanged himself with a sheet.  Id., at 311312.
Barkess wife and children, respondents here, brought suit under Rev. Stat. 1979,

42 U.S.C. 1983, against various entities and individuals connected with the Institution, who they claimed had violated Barkess civil rights in failing to prevent his suicide.  At issue here is a claim against petitioners Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Correction (DOC), and Raphael Williams, the Institutions warden.  Although it is undisputed that neither petitioner had personally interacted with Barkes or knew of his condition before his death, respondents alleged that Taylor and Williams had violated Barkess constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Barkes v. First Correctional Medical, Inc., 2008 WL 523216, *7 (D Del., Feb. 27, 2008).  They did so, according to respondents, by failing to supervise and monitor the private contractor that provided the medical treatmentincluding the intake screeningat the Institution.  Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immu-nity, but the District Court denied the motion.  Barkes v. First Correctional Medical, Inc., 2012 WL 2914915, *8*12 (D Del., July 17, 2012).
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  The majority first determined that respondents had alleged a cognizable theory of supervisory liability (a decision upon which we express no view).  766 F.3d, at 316325.  The majority then turned to the two-step qualified immunity inquiry, asking first, whether the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of a constitutional or stat-utory right; and second, if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct.  Id., at 326.
Taking these questions in reverse order, the Third Circuit held that it was clearly established at the time of Barkess death that an incarcerated individual had an
 
Eighth Amendment right to the proper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.  Id., at 327.  The panel majority then concluded there were material factual disputes about whether petitioners had violated this right by failing to adequately supervise the contractor providing medical services at the prison.  There was evidence, the majority noted, that the medical contractors suicide screening process did not comply with NCCHCs latest standards, as required by the contract.  Those standards allegedly called for a revised screening form and for screening by a qualified mental health professional, not a nurse.  There was also evidence that the contractor did not have access to Barkess probation records (which would have shed light on his mental health history), and that the contractor had been short-staffing to increase profits.  Id., at 330331.
Judge Hardiman dissented.  As relevant here, he concluded that petitioners were entitled to qualified immu-nity because the right on which the majority relied was a departure from
 
Eighth Amendment case law that had never been established before today.  Id., at 345.
Taylor and Williams petitioned for certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse on the ground that there was no violation of clearly established law.
Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.  Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5).  To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.  Ibid. (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  When properly applied, [qualified immunity] protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).
The Third Circuit concluded that the right at issue was best defined as an incarcerated persons right to the proper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.  766 F.3d, at 327.  This purported right, however, was not clearly established in November 2004 in a way that placed beyond debate the unconstitutionality of the Institutions procedures, as implemented by the medical contractor.
No decision of this Court establishes a right to theproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention pro-tocols.  No decision of this Court even discusses suicide screening or prevention protocols.  And to the extent that a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority in the Courts of Appeals could itself clearly establish the federal right respondent alleges, City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 16), the weight of that authority at the time of Barkess death suggested that such a right did not exist.  See, e.g., Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702 (CA6 2001) (the right to medical care for serious medical needs does not encompass the right to be screened correctly for suicidal tendencies (internal quotation marks omitted)); Tittle v. Jefferson Cty. Commn, 10 F.3d 1535, 1540 (CA11 1994) (alleged weaknesses in the [suicide] screening process, the training of deputies[,] and the supervision of prisoners did not amount to a showing of deliberate indifference toward the rights of prisoners); Burns v. Galveston, 905 F.2d 100, 104 (CA5 1990) (rejecting the proposition that the right of detainees to adequate medical care includes an absolute right to psychological screening); Belcher v. Oliver, 898 F.2d 32, 3435 (CA4 1990) (The general right of pretrial detainees to receive basic medical care does not place upon jail officials the responsibility to screen every detainee for suicidal tendencies.).
The Third Circuit nonetheless found this right clearly established by two of its own decisions, both stemming from the same case.  Assuming for the sake of argument that a right can be clearly established by circuit precedent despite disagreement in the courts of appeals, neither of the Third Circuit decisions relied upon clearly established the right at issue.  The first, Colburn I, said that if officials know or should know of the particular vulner-ability to suicide of an inmate, they have an obligation not to act with reckless indifference to that vulnerability.  Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 838 F.2d 663, 669 (1988).  The decision did not say, however, that detention facilities must implement procedures to identify such vulnerable inmates, let alone specify what procedures would suffice.  And the Third Circuit later acknowledged that Colburn Is use of the phrase or should knowwhich might seem to nod toward a screening requirement of some kindwas erroneous in light of Farmer v. Brennan,

511 U.S. 825 (1994)
, which held that
 
Eighth Amendment liability requires actual awareness of risk.  See Serafin v. Johnstown, 53 Fed. Appx. 211, 213 (CA3 2002).
Nor would Colburn II have put petitioners on notice of any possible constitutional violation.  Colburn II reiter-ated that officials who know of an inmates particular vul-nerability to suicide must not be recklessly indifferent to that vulnerability.  Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 1023 (1991).  But it did not identify any minimum screening procedures or prevention protocols that facilities must use.  In fact, Colburn II revealed that the booking process of the jail at issue include[d] no formal physical or mental health screening, ibid., and yet the Third Circuit ruled for the defendants on all claims, see id., at 10251031.
In short, even if the Institutions suicide screening and prevention measures contained the shortcomings that respondents allege, no precedent on the books in November 2004 would have made clear to petitioners that they were overseeing a system that violated the Constitution.  Because, at the very least, petitioners were not contravening clearly established law, they are entitled to qualified immunity.  The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC., etal. v. UNITED STATES exrel. CARTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 121497.Argued January 13, 2015Decided May 26, 2015
Private parties may file civil qui tam actions to enforce the False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits making a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,

31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(1), to ... the United States, 3729(b)(2)(A)(i).  A qui tam action must generally be brought within six years of a violation, 3731(b), but the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA) suspends the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense involving fraud against the Federal Government.

18 U.S.C. 3287.  Separately, the FCAs first-to-file bar precludes a qui tam suit based on the facts underlying [a] pending action, 3730(b)(5).
In 2005, respondent worked for one of the petitioners, providing logistical services to the United States military in Iraq.  He subsequently filed a qui tam complaint (Carter I), alleging that petitioners, who are defense contractors and related entities, had fraudulently billed the Government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.  In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed qui tam suit (Thorpe) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss Carter I without prejudice under the first-to-file bar.  While respondents appeal was pending, Thorpe was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (Carter II), but the court dismissed it under the first-to-file rule because Carter Is appeal was pending.  Respondent then dismissed that appeal, and in June 2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, filed the instant complaint (Carter III).  The District Court dismissed this complaint with prejudice under the first-to-file rule because of a pending Maryland suit.  Further, because the WSLA applies only to criminal charges, the court reasoned, all but one of respondents civil actions were untimely.  Reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the WSLA applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed.  Since any pending suits had by then been dismissed, the court held, respondent had the right to refile his case.  It thus remanded Carter III with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
Held:
1.As shown by the WSLAs text, structure, and history, the Act applies only to criminal offenses, not to civil claims like those in this case.  Pp.511.
(a)The 1921 and 1942 versions of the WSLA were enacted to address war-related fraud during, respectively, the First and Second World Wars.  Both extended the statute of limitations for fraud offenses now indictable under any existing statutes.  Since only crimes are indictable, these provisions quite clearly were limited to criminal charges.  In 1944, Congress made the WSLA prospectively applicable to future wartime frauds rather than merely applicable to past frauds as earlier versions had been.  In doing so, it deleted the phrase now indictable under any statute, so that the WSLA now applied to any offense against the laws of the United States.  Congress made additional changes in 1948 and codified the WSLA in Title 18 U.S.C.  Pp.56.
(b)Section 3287s text supports limiting the WSLA to criminal charges.  The term offense is most commonly used to refer to crimes, especially given the WSLAs location in Title 18, titled Crimes and Criminal Procedure, where no provision appears to employ offense to denote a civil violation rather than a civil penalty attached to a criminal offense.  And when Title 18 was enacted in 1948, its very first provision classified all offenses as crimes.  In similar circumstances, this Court has regarded a provisions placement as relevant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal.  Kansas v. Hendricks,

521 U.S. 346
.  The WSLAs history provides further support for this reading.  The term offenses in the 1921 and 1942 statutes, the parties agree, applied only to crimes.  And it is improbable that the 1944 Acts removal of the phrase now indictable under any statute had the effect of sweeping in civil claims, a fundamental change in scope not typically accomplished with so subtle a move.  The more plausible explanation is that Congress removed that phrase in order to change the WSLA from a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a permanent measure applicable to future fraud as well.  If there were any ambiguity in the WSLAs use of the term offense, that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of a narrower definition.  See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 216.  Pp.711.
2.The FCAs first-to-file bar keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive, not in perpetuity.  Thus, dismissal with prejudice was not called for in this case.  This reading of 3730(b)(5) is in accordance with the ordinary dictionary meaning of the term pending.  Contrary to petitioners reading, the term pending cannot be seen as a sort of short-hand for first-filed, which is neither a lengthy nor a complex term.  Petitioners reading would also bar even a suit dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with the merits, such as Thorpe, which was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Pp.1113.
710 F.3d 171, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.

KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC., etal. v. UNITED STATES exrel. CARTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 121497.Argued January 13, 2015Decided May 26, 2015
Private parties may file civil qui tam actions to enforce the False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits making a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,

31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(1), to ... the United States, 3729(b)(2)(A)(i).  A qui tam action must generally be brought within six years of a violation, 3731(b), but the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA) suspends the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense involving fraud against the Federal Government.

18 U.S.C. 3287.  Separately, the FCAs first-to-file bar precludes a qui tam suit based on the facts underlying [a] pending action, 3730(b)(5).
In 2005, respondent worked for one of the petitioners, providing logistical services to the United States military in Iraq.  He subsequently filed a qui tam complaint (Carter I), alleging that petitioners, who are defense contractors and related entities, had fraudulently billed the Government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.  In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed qui tam suit (Thorpe) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss Carter I without prejudice under the first-to-file bar.  While respondents appeal was pending, Thorpe was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (Carter II), but the court dismissed it under the first-to-file rule because Carter Is appeal was pending.  Respondent then dismissed that appeal, and in June 2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, filed the instant complaint (Carter III).

Syllabus
COMMIL USA, LLC v. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13896.Argued March 31, 2015Decided May 26, 2015
Petitioner Commil USA, LLC, holder of a patent for a method of implementing short-range wireless networks, filed suit, claiming that respondent Cisco Systems, Inc., a maker and seller of wireless networking equipment, had directly infringed Commils patent in its networking equipment and had induced others to infringe the patent by selling the infringing equipment for them to use.  After two trials, Cisco was found liable for both direct and induced infringement.  With regard to inducement, Cisco had raised the defense that it had a good-faith belief that Commils patent was invalid, but the District Court found Ciscos supporting evidence inadmissible.  The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts judgment in part, vacated in part, and remanded, holding, as relevant here, that the trial court erred in excluding Ciscos evidence of its good-faith belief that Commils patent was invalid. 
Held:A defendants belief regarding patent validity is not a defense to an induced infringement claim.  Pp.514.
(a)While this case centers on inducement liability,

35 U.S.C. 271(b), which attaches only if the defendant knew of the patent and that the induced acts constitute patent infringement, Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. ___, ___, the discussion here also refers to direct infringement, 271(a), a strict-liability offense in which a defendants mental state is irrelevant, and contributory infringement, 271(c), which, like inducement liability, requires knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of patent infringement, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.,

377 U.S. 476
 (Aro II).  Pp.56.
(b)In Global-Tech, this Court held that induced infringement ... requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement, 563 U.S., at ___, relying on the reasoning of Aro II, a contributory infringement case, because the mental state imposed in each instance is similar.  Contrary to the claim of Commil and the Government as amicus, it was not only knowledge of the existence of respondents patent that led the Court to affirm the liability finding in Global-Tech, but also the fact that petitioners actions demonstrated that it knew it would be causing customers to infringe respondents patent.  563 U.S., at ___.  Qualifying or limiting that holding could make a person, or entity, liable for induced or contributory infringement even though he did not know the acts were infringing.  Global-Tech requires more, namely proof the defendant knew the acts were infringing.  And that opinion was clear in rejecting any lesser mental state as the standard.  Id., at ___.  Pp.69.
(c)Because induced infringement and validity are separate issues and have separate defenses under the Act, belief regarding validity cannot negate 271(b)s scienter requirement of actively induce[d] infringement, i.e., the intent to bring about the desired result of infringement, 563 U.S., at ___.  When infringement is the issue, the patents validity is not the question to be confronted.  See Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Intl, Inc.,

508 U.S. 83
.  Otherwise, the long held presumption that a patent is valid, 282(a), would be undermined, permitting circumvention of the high barthe clear and convincing standardthat defendants must surmount to rebut the presumption.  See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. ___, ______.  To be sure, if a patent is shown to be invalid, there is no patent to be infringed.  But the orderly administration of the patent system requires courts to interpret and implement the statutory framework to determine the procedures and sequences that the parties must follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and any related issues of patent validity.
There are practical reasons not to create a defense of belief in invalidity for induced infringement.  Accused inducers who believe a patent is invalid have other, proper ways to obtain a ruling to that effect, including, e.g., seeking ex parte reexamination of the patent by the Patent and Trademark Office, something Cisco did here.  Creating such a defense could also have negative consequences, including, e.g., rendering litigation more burdensome for all involved.  Pp. 913.
(d)District courts have the authority and responsibility to ensure that frivolous casesbrought by companies using patents as a sword to go after defendants for moneyare dissuaded, though no issue of frivolity has been raised here.  Safeguardsincluding, e.g., sanctioning attorneys for bringing such suits, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.11combined with the avenues that accused inducers have to obtain rulings on the validity of patents, militate in favor of maintaining the separation between infringement and validity expressed in the Patent Act.  Pp.1314.
720 F.3d 1361, vacated and remanded.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Ginsburg, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Thomas, J., joined as to Parts IIB and III.

WELLNESS INTERNATIONAL NETWORK, LTD., etal. v. SHARIF
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 13935.Argued January 14, 2015Decided May 26, 2015
Respondent Richard Sharif tried to discharge a debt he owed petitioners, Wellness International Network, Ltd., and its owners (collectively Wellness), in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Wellness sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharifs alter-ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his bankruptcy estate.  The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a default judgment against Sharif.  While Sharifs appeal was pending in District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Article III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims that seek only to augment the bankruptcy estate and would otherwise exis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. ___, ___.  After briefing closed, Sharif sought permission to file a supplemental brief raising a Stern objection.  The District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed the Bankruptcy Courts judgment.  As relevant here, the Seventh Circuit determined that Sharifs Stern objection could not be waived because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final judgment on that claim.   
Held:
1.Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims with the parties knowing and voluntary consent.  Pp.817.
(a)The foundational case supporting the adjudication of legal disputes by non-Article III judges with the consent of the parties is Commodity Futures Trading Commn v. Schor,

478 U.S. 833
.  There, the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III court is personal and therefore subject to waiver.  Id., at 848.  The Court also recognized that if Article IIIs structural interests as an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances are implicated, the parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty.  Id., at 850851.  The importance of consent was reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Acts assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voirdire in felony trials.  In Gomez v. United States,

490 U. S. 858
, the Court held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury without the defendants consent, id., at 864.  But in Peretz v. United States,

501 U. S. 923
, the Court stated that the defendants consent significantly changes the constitutional analysis, id., at 932.  Because an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the process, the Court found no structural protections ... implicated and upheld the Magistrate Judges action.  Id., at 937.  Pp. 812.
(b)The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would impermissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch, Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must be decided with an eye to the practical effect that the practice will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary, ibid.  For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitutional prerogatives of Article III courts.  Bankruptcy judges are appointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C. 152(a)(1), (e); serve as judicial officers of the United States district court, 151; and collectively constitute a unit of the district court for the district in which they serve, 152(a)(1).  Bankruptcy courts hear matters solely on a district courts reference, 157(a), and possess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856.  [T]he decision to invoke the bankruptcy courts authority is left entirely to the parties, id., at 855, and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction remains in place, ibid.  Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary.  See, e.g., Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937.  Pp.1215.
(c)Stern does not compel a different result.  It turned on the fact that the litigant did not truly consent to resolution of the claim against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court.  Moreover, expanding Stern to hold that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through consent would be inconsistent with that opinions own description of its holding as a narrow one that did not change all that much about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.  Id., at ___.  Pp.1517.
2.Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be express, but must be knowing and voluntary.  Neither the Constitution nor the relevant statutewhich requires the consent of all parties to the proceeding to hear a Stern claim, 157(c)(2)mandates express consent.  Such a requirement would be in great tension with this Courts holding that substantially similar language in 636(c)which authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings [u]pon consent of the partiespermits waiver based on actions rather than words, Roell v. Withrow,

538 U.S. 580
.  Roells implied consent standard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications and makes clear that a litigants consentwhether express or impliedmust be knowing and voluntary.  Pp.1819.
3.The Seventh Circuit should decide on remand whether Sharifs actions evinced the requisite knowing and voluntary consent and whether Sharif forfeited his Stern argument below.  P.20.
727 F.3d 751, reversed and remanded.
Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Alito, J., joined in part.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Roberts, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined, and in which Thomas, J., joined as to Part I.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

The Court also recognized that if Article IIIs structural interests as an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances are implicated, the parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty.  Id., at 850851.  The importance of consent was reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Acts assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voirdire in felony trials.  In Gomez v. United States,

490 U. S. 858
, the Court held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury without the defendants consent, id., at 864.  But in Peretz v. United States,

501 U. S. 923
, the Court stated that the defendants consent significantly changes the constitutional analysis, id., at 932.  Because an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the process, the Court found no structural protections ... implicated and upheld the Magistrate Judges action.  Id., at 937.  Pp. 812.
(b)The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would impermissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch, Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must be decided with an eye to the practical effect that the practice will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary, ibid.  For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitutional prerogatives of Article III courts.  Bankruptcy judges are appointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C. 152(a)(1), (e); serve as judicial officers of the United States district court, 151; and collectively constitute a unit of the district court for the district in which they serve, 152(a)(1).  Bankruptcy courts hear matters solely on a district courts reference, 157(a), and possess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856.  [T]he decision to invoke the bankruptcy courts authority is left entirely to the parties, id., at 855, and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction remains in place, ibid.  Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary.  See, e.g., Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937.  Pp.1215.
(c)Stern does not compel a different result.  It turned on the fact that the litigant did not truly consent to resolution of the claim against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court.  Moreover, expanding Stern to hold that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through consent would be inconsistent with that opinions own description of its holding as a narrow one that did not change all that much about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.  Id., at ___.  Pp.1517.
2.Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be express, but must be knowing and voluntary.  Neither the Constitution nor the relevant statutewhich requires the consent of all parties to the proceeding to hear a Stern claim, 157(c)(2)mandates express consent.  Such a requirement would be in great tension with this Courts holding that substantially similar language in 636(c)which authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings [u]pon consent of the partiespermits waiver based on actions rather than words, Roell v. Withrow,

538 U.S. 580
.  Roells implied consent standard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications and makes clear that a litigants consentwhether express or impliedmust be knowing and voluntary.  Pp.1819.
3.The Seventh Circuit should decide on remand whether Sharifs actions evinced the requisite knowing and voluntary consent and whether Sharif forfeited his Stern argument below.  P.20.

			Sharif tried to discharge a debt to Wellness in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wellness argued that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was actually Sharifs alter ego, and that its assets were part of his bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Court entered default judgment against Sharif. While appeal was pending, but before briefing concluded, the Supreme Court held (Stern v. Marshall) that Article III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter final judgment on claims that seek only to augment the bankruptcy estate and would otherwise exis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.  The district court denied Sharif permission to file a supplemental brief and affirmed. The Seventh Circuit determined that Sharifs Stern objection could not be waived and reversed, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter judgment on the alter ego claim. The Supreme Court reversed.  Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims with the parties knowing and voluntary consent. The right to adjudication before an Article III court is personal and subject to waiver, unless Article IIIs structural interests as an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances are implicated; parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty. Allowing bankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent does not usurp the constitutional prerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges are appointed and may be removed by Article III judges, hear matters solely on a district courts reference, and possess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by Article III courts. Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be express, but must be knowing and voluntary. The Seventh Circuit should decide on remand whether Sharifs actions evinced the requisite knowing and voluntary consent and whether Sharif forfeited his Stern argument.

COLEMAN, aka COLEMAN-BEY v. TOLLEFSON etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 131333.Argued February 23, 2015Decided May 18, 2015[1]
Ordinarily, a federal litigant who is too poor to pay court fees may proceed in forma pauperis.  This means that the litigant may commence a civil action without prepaying fees or paying certain expenses.  See

28 U.S.C. 1915(a).  But a special three strikes provision prevents a court from affording in forma pauperis status to a prisoner who has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated ... , brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  1915(g).
Petitioner Coleman, a state prisoner, filed three federal lawsuits that were dismissed on grounds enumerated in 1915(g).  While the third dismissal was pending on appeal, he filed four additional federal lawsuits, moving to proceed in forma pauperis in each.  The District Court refused to permit him to proceed in forma pauperis in any of those lawsuits, holding that a prior dismissal is a strike under 1915(g) even if it is pending on appeal.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court.
Held:A prior dismissal on one of 1915(g)s statutorily enumerated grounds counts as a strike, even if the dismissal is the subject of an ongoing appeal.  Pp.49.
(a)Coleman suggests that that a dismissal should count as a strike only once appellate review is complete.  But the word dismissed does not normally include subsequent appellate activity.  See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins,

514 U.S. 291
.  And 1915 itself describes dismissal as an action taken by a single court, not as a sequence of events involving multiple courts.  See 1915(e).  Coleman further contends that the phrase prior occasions creates ambiguity.  But nothing about that phrase transforms a dismissal into a dismissal-plus-appellate-review.  In the context of 1915(g), a prior occasion merely means a previous instance in which a prisoner has ... brought an action or appeal ... that was dismissed on statutorily enumerated grounds.
A literal reading of the three strikes provision is consistent with the statutes treatment of the trial and appellate states of litigation as distinct.  See 1915(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (e)(2), (g).  It is also supported by the way in which the law ordinarily treats trial court judgments, i.e., a judgment normally takes effect despite a pending appeal, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 62; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a), and its preclusive effect is generally immediate, notwithstanding any appeal, see Clay v. United States,

537 U.S. 522
.
Finally, the statutes purpose favors this Courts interpretation.  The three strikes provision was designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good, Jones v. Bock,

549 U.S. 199
.  To refuse to count a prior dismissal because of a pending appeal would produce a leaky filter, because a prisoner could file many new lawsuits before reaching the end of the often lengthy appellate process.  By contrast, the Court perceives no great risk that an erroneous trial court dismissal might wrongly deprive a prisoner of in forma pauperis status in a subsequent lawsuit.  Pp.48.
(b)Coleman also argues that if the dismissal of a third complaint counts as a third strike, a litigant will lose the ability to appeal in forma pauperis from that strike itself.  He believes this is a result that Congress could not possibly have intended.  Because Coleman is not appealing from a third-strike trial-court dismissal here, the Court declines to address that question.  Pp.89.
733 F.3d 175, affirmed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, etal. v. SHEEHAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131412.Argued March 23, 2015Decided May 18, 2015
Respondent Sheehan lived in a group home for individuals with mental illness.  After Sheehan began acting erratically and threatened to kill her social worker, the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) dispatched police officers Reynolds and Holder to help escort Sheehan to a facility for temporary evaluation and treatment.  When the officers first entered Sheehans room, she grabbed a knife and threatened to kill them.  They retreated and closed the door.  Concerned about what Sheehan might do behind the closed door, and without considering if they could accommodate her disability, the officers reentered her room.  Sheehan, knife in hand, again confronted them.  After pepper spray proved ineffective, the officers shot Sheehan multiple times.  Sheehan later sued petitioner San Francisco for, among other things, violating Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) by arresting her without accommodating her disability.  See

42 U.S.C. 12132.  She also sued petitioners Reynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under

42 U.S.C. 1983, claiming that they violated her
 
Fourth Amendment rights.  The District Court granted summary judgment because it concluded that officers making an arrest are not required to determine whether their actions would comply with the ADA before protecting themselves and others, and also that Reynolds and Holder did not violate the Constitution.  Vacating in part, the Ninth Circuit held that the ADA applied and that a jury must decide whether San Francisco should have accommodated Sheehan.  The court also held that Reynolds and Holder are not entitled to qualified immunity because it is clearly established that, absent an objective need for immediate entry, officers cannot forcibly enter the home of an armed, mentally ill person who has been acting irrationally and has threatened anyone who enters.
Held:
1.The question whether 12132 requires law enforcement officers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent, and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody, Pet. for Cert. i, is dismissed as improvidently granted.  Certiorari was granted on the understanding that San Francisco would argue that Title II of the ADA does not apply when an officer faces an armed and dangerous individual.  Instead, San Francisco merely argues that Sheehan was not qualified for an accommodation, 12132, because she pose[d] a direct threat to the health or safety of others, which threat could not be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services, 28 CFR 35.139(a), 35.104.  This argument was not passed on by the court below.  The decision to dismiss this question as improvidently granted, moreover, is reinforced by the parties failure to address the related question whether a public entity can be vicariously liable for damages under Title II for an arrest made by its police officers.  Pp.710.
2.Reynolds and Holder are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for the injuries suffered by Sheehan.  Public officials are immune from suit under

42 U.S.C. 1983 unless they have violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct, Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. ___, ___, an exacting standard that gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments, Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. ___, ___. The officers did not violate the
 
Fourth Amendment when they opened Sheehans door the first time, and there is no doubt that they could have opened her door the second time without violating her rights had Sheehan not been disabled.  Their use of force was also reasonable.  The only question therefore is whether they violated the
 
Fourth Amendment when they decided to reopen Sheehans door rather than attempt to accommodate her disability.  Because any such
 
Fourth Amendment right, even assuming it exists, was not clearly established, Reynolds and Holder are entitled to qualified immunity.  Likewise, an alleged failure on the part of the officers to follow their training does not itself negate qualified immunity where it would otherwise be warranted.  Pp.1017.
Certiorari dismissed in part; 743 F.3d 1211, reversed in part and remanded.

HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 131487.Argued February 24, 2015Decided May 18, 2015
After being charged with the felony offense of distributing marijuana, petitioner Tony Henderson was required as a condition of his bail to turn over firearms that he lawfully owned.  Henderson ultimately pleaded guilty, and, as a felon, was prohibited under

18 U.S.C. 922(g) from possessing his (or any other) firearms.  Henderson therefore asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had custody of his firearms, to transfer them to his friend.  But the agency refused to do so.  Henderson then filed a motion in federal district court seeking to transfer his firearms, but the court denied the motion on the ground that Hendersons requested transfer would give him constructive possession of the firearms in violation of 922(g).  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:A court-ordered transfer of a felons lawfully owned firearms from Government custody to a third party is not barred by 922(g) if the court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use.  Federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding to its rightful owner.  Section 922(g), however, bars a court from ordering guns returned to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that would place the owner in violation of the law.  And because 922(g) bans constructive as well as actual possession, it also prevents a court from ordering the transfer of a felons guns to someone willing to give the felon access to them or to accede to the felons instructions about their future use.
The Government goes further, arguing that 922(g) prevents all transfers to a third party, no matter how independent of the felons influence, unless that recipient is a licensed firearms dealer or other third party who will sell the guns on the open market.  But that view conflates possession, which 922(g) prohibits, with an owners right merely to alienate his property, which it does not.  After all, the Governments reading of 922(g) would prohibit a felon from disposing of his firearms even when he would lack any control over and thus not possess them before, during, or after the disposition.  That reading would also extend 922(g)s scope far beyond its purpose; preventing a felon like Henderson from disposing of his firearms, even in ways that guarantee he never uses them again, does nothing to advance the statutes goal of keeping firearms away from felons.  Finally, the Governments insistence that a felon cannot select a third-party recipient over whom he exercises no influence fits poorly with its concession that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell his guns.  The Governments reading of 922(g) is thus overbroad.
Accordingly, a court may approve the transfer of a felons guns consistently with 922(g) if, but only if, the recipient will not grant the felon control over those weapons.  One way to ensure that result is to order that the guns be turned over to a firearms dealer, himself independent of the felons control, for subsequent sale on the open market.  But that is not the only option; a court, with proper assurances from the recipient, may also grant a felons request to transfer his guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them.  Either way, once a court is satisfied that the transferee will not allow the felon to exert any influence over the firearms, the court has equitable power to accommodate the felons transfer request.

Held:A court-ordered transfer of a felons lawfully owned firearms from Government custody to a third party is not barred by 922(g) if the court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use.  Federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding to its rightful owner.  Section 922(g), however, bars a court from ordering guns returned to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that would place the owner in violation of the law.  And because 922(g) bans constructive as well as actual possession, it also prevents a court from ordering the transfer of a felons guns to someone willing to give the felon access to them or to accede to the felons instructions about their future use.
The Government goes further, arguing that 922(g) prevents all transfers to a third party, no matter how independent of the felons influence, unless that recipient is a licensed firearms dealer or other third party who will sell the guns on the open market.  But that view conflates possession, which 922(g) prohibits, with an owners right merely to alienate his property, which it does not.  After all, the Governments reading of 922(g) would prohibit a felon from disposing of his firearms even when he would lack any control over and thus not possess them before, during, or after the disposition.  That reading would also extend 922(g)s scope far beyond its purpose; preventing a felon like Henderson from disposing of his firearms, even in ways that guarantee he never uses them again, does nothing to advance the statutes goal of keeping firearms away from felons.  Finally, the Governments insistence that a felon cannot select a third-party recipient over whom he exercises no influence fits poorly with its concession that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell his guns.  The Governments reading of 922(g) is thus overbroad.
Accordingly, a court may approve the transfer of a felons guns consistently with 922(g) if, but only if, the recipient will not grant the felon control over those weapons.  One way to ensure that result is to order that the guns be turned over to a firearms dealer, himself independent of the felons control, for subsequent sale on the open market.  But that is not the only option; a court, with proper assurances from the recipient, may also grant a felons request to transfer his guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them.  Either way, once a court is satisfied that the transferee will not allow the felon to exert any influence over the firearms, the court has equitable power to accommodate the felons transfer request.

555 Fed. Appx. 851, vacated and remanded.
Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."|"
			After being charged with the felony offense of distributing marijuana, Henderson was required, as a condition of bail, to turn over firearms that he lawfully owned. Henderson pleaded guilty, and, as a felon, was prohibited under 18 U.S.C. 922(g) from possessing any firearms. Henderson asked the FBI, which had custody of his firearms, to transfer them to his friend. The agency refused. The district court reasoned that Hendersons requested transfer would give him constructive possession of the firearms. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. The unanimous Supreme Court vacated: A court-ordered transfer of a felons lawfully owned firearms from government custody to a third party is not barred by section 922(g) if the court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use. The governments view conflated possession, which section 922(g) prohibits, with an owners right to alienate his property, which it does not.  The Court stated that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell his guns; a court, with proper assurances from the recipient, may also grant a felons request to transfer his guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them.

comptroller of the treasury of maryland v. wynne et ux.
certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland
No. 13485.Argued November 12, 2014Decided May 18, 2015
Marylands personal income tax on state residents consists of a state income tax, Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. 10105(a), and a county income tax, 10103, 10106.  Residents who pay income tax to another jurisdiction for income earned in that other jurisdiction are allowed a credit against the state tax but not the county tax.  10703.  Nonresidents who earn income from sources within Maryland must pay the state income tax, 10105(d), 10210, and nonresidents not subject to the county tax must pay a special nonresident tax in lieu of the county tax, 10106.1.
Respondents, Maryland residents, earned pass-through income from a Subchapter S corporation that earned income in several States.  Respondents claimed an income tax credit on their 2006 Maryland income tax return for taxes paid to other States.  The Mary-land State Comptroller of the Treasury, petitioner here, allowed respondents a credit against their state income tax but not against their county income tax and assessed a tax deficiency.  That decision was affirmed by the Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comptrollers Office and by the Maryland Tax Court, but the Circuit Court for Howard County reversed on the ground that Marylands tax system violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed and held that the tax unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.
Held:Marylands personal income tax scheme violates the dormant Commerce Clause.  Pp.428.
(a)The Commerce Clause, which grants Congress power to regulate Commerce ...among the several States, Art I, 8, cl.3, also has a further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179, which precludes States from discriminat[ing] between transactions on the basis of some interstate element, Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commn,

, n.12.  Thus, inter alia, a State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the State, Armco Inc. v. Hardesty,

358 U. S. 450
.  Pp.46.
(b)The result in this case is all but dictated by this Courts dormant Commerce Clause cases, particularly J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen,

304 U.S. 307
, Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford,

305 U.S. 434
, and Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey,

334 U.S. 653
, which all invalidated state tax schemes that might lead to double taxation of out-of-state income and that discriminated in favor of intrastate over interstate economic activity.  Pp.67.
(c)This conclusion is not affected by the fact that these three cases involved a tax on gross receipts rather than net income, and a tax on corporations rather than individuals.  This Courts decisions have previously rejected the formal distinction between gross receipts and net income taxes.  And there is no reason the dormant Commerce Clause should treat individuals less favorably than corporations; in addition, the taxes invalidated in J.D. Adams and Gwin, White applied to the income of both individuals and corporations.  Nor does the right of the individual to vote in political elections justify disparate treatment of corporate and personal income.  Thus the Court has previously entertained and even sustained dormant Commerce Clause challenges by individual residents of the State that imposed the alleged burden on interstate commerce.

; Granholm v. Heald,

.  Pp.712.
(d) Marylands tax scheme is not immune from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny simply because Maryland has the jurisdictional power under the Due Process Clause to impose the tax.

(e)Marylands income tax scheme discriminates against interstate commerce.  The internal consistency test, which helps courts identify tax schemes that discriminate against interstate commerce, as-sumes that every State has the same tax structure.  Marylands income tax scheme fails the internal consistency test because if every State adopted Marylands tax structure, interstate commerce would be taxed at a higher rate than intrastate commerce.  Marylands tax scheme is inherently discriminatory and operates as a tariff, which is fatal because tariffs are [t]he paradigmatic example of a law discriminating against interstate commerce.  West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,

512 U.S. 186
.  Petitioner emphasizes that by offering residents who earn income in interstate commerce a credit against the state portion of the income tax, Maryland actually receives less tax revenue from residents who earn income from interstate commerce rather than intrastate commerce, but this argument is a red herring.  The critical point is that the total tax burden on interstate commerce is higher.  Pp.1826.

TIBBLE etal. v. EDISON INTERNATIONAL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13550.Argued February 24, 2015Decided May 18, 2015
In 2007, petitioners, beneficiaries of the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan (Plan), sued Plan fiduciaries, respondents Edison International and others, to recover damages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan from alleged breaches of respondents fiduciary duties.  As relevant here, petitioners argued that respondents violated their fiduciary duties with respect to three mutual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and three mutual funds added to the Plan in 2002.  Petitioners argued that respondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced retail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available.  Because ERISA requires a breach of fiduciary duty complaint to be filed no more than six years after the date of the last action which constitutes a part of the breach or violation or in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,

29 U.S.C. 1113, the District Court held that petitioners complaint as to the 1999 funds was untimely because they were included in the Plan more than six years before the complaint was filed, and the circumstances had not changed enough within the 6-year statutory period to place respondents under an obligation to review the mutual funds and to convert them to lower priced  institutional-class funds.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that petitioners had not established a change in circumstances that might trigger an obligation to conduct a full due diligence review of the 1999 funds within the 6-year statutory period.
Held:The Ninth Circuit erred by applying 1113s statutory bar to a breach of fiduciary duty claim based on the initial selection of the investments without considering the contours of the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  ERISAs fiduciary duty is derived from the common law of trusts, Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc.,

, which provides that a trustee has a continuing dutyseparate and apart from the duty to exercise prudence in selecting investments at the outsetto monitor, and remove imprudent, trust investments.  So long as a plaintiffs claim alleging breach of the continuing duty of prudence occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely.  This Court expresses no view on the scope of respondents fiduciary duty in this case, e.g., whether a review of the contested mutual funds is required, and, if so, just what kind of review.  A fiduciary must discharge his responsibilities with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.  1104(a)(1).

HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14400.Argued April 1, 2015Decided May 18, 2015
Individual debtors may seek discharge of their financial obligations under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In a Chapter 7 proceeding, the debtors assets are transferred to a bankruptcy estate.

11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1).  The estates assets are then promptly liquidated, 704(a)(1), and distributed to creditors, 726.  A Chapter 7 estate, however, does not include the wages a debtor earns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.  541(a)(1).  Chapter 13, a wholly voluntary alternative to Chapter 7, permits the debtor to retain assets during bankruptcy subject to a court-approved plan for payment of his debts.  Payments under a Chapter 13 plan are usually made from a debtors future income.  1322(a)(1).  The Chapter 13 estate, unlike a Chapter 7 estate, therefore includes both the debtors property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and any assets he acquires after filing. 1306(a).  Because many debtors fail to complete a Chapter 13 plan successfully, Congress accorded debtors a nonwaivable right to convert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter 7 at any time.  1307(a).  Conversion does not commence a new bankruptcy case, but it does terminate the service of the Chapter 13 trustee.  348(e).
Petitioner Harris, indebted to multiple creditors and $3,700 behind on his home mortgage payments to Chase Manhattan, filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.  His court-confirmed plan provided that he would resume making monthly mortgage payments to Chase, and that $530 per month would be withheld from his postpetition wages and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent Viegelahn.  Trustee Viegelahn would make monthly payments to Chase to pay down Harris mortgage arrears, and distribute remaining funds to Harris other creditors.  When Harris again fell behind on his mortgage pay-ments, Chase foreclosed on his home.  Following the foreclosure, Viegelahn continued to receive $530 per month from Harris wages, but stopped making the payments earmarked for Chase.  As a result, funds formerly reserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahns possession.  Approximately a year after the foreclosure, Harris converted his case to Chapter 7.  Ten days after this conversion, Viegelahn distributed $5,519.22 in Harris withheld wages mainly to Harris creditors.  Asserting that Viegelahn lacked authority to disburse his postpetition wages to creditors postconversion, Harris sought an order from the Bankruptcy Court directing refund of the accumulated wages Viegelahn paid to his creditors.  The Bankruptcy Court granted Harris motion, and the District Court affirmed.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that a former Chapter 13 trustee must distribute a debtors accumulated postpetition wages to his creditors.
Held:A debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any postpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee.  Pp.511.
(a)Absent a bad-faith conversion, 348(f) limits a converted Chapter 7 estate to property belonging to the debtor as of the date the original Chapter 13 petition was filed.  Because postpetition wages do not fit that bill, undistributed wages collected by a Chapter 13 trustee ordinarily do not become part of a converted Chapter 7 estate.  Pp.56.
(b)By excluding postpetition wages from the converted Chapter 7 estate (absent a bad-faith conversion), 348(f) removes those earnings from the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distributed to creditors.  Allowing a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to disburse the very same earnings to the very same creditors is incompatible with that statutory design.  Pp. 78.
(c)This conclusion is reinforced by 348(e), which terminates the service of [the Chapter 13] trustee upon conversion.  One service provided by a Chapter 13 trustee is disbursing payments to creditors.  1326(c).  The moment a case is converted from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, a Chapter 13 trustee is stripped of authority to provide that service.  P. 8.
(d)Section 1327(a), which provides that a confirmed Chapter 13 plan bind[s] the debtor and each creditor, and 1326(a)(2), which instructs a trustee to distribute payment[s] in accordance with the plan, ceased to apply once the case was converted to Chapter 7.  103(i).  Sections 1327(a) and 1326(a)(2), therefore, offer no support for Viegelahns assertion that the Bankruptcy Code requires a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to distribute to creditors postpetition wages remaining in the trustees possession.  Continuing to distribute funds to creditors pursuant to a defunct Chapter 13 plan, moreover, is not one of the trustees postconversion responsibilities specified by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.  Pp.810.

HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 14400.Argued April 1, 2015Decided May 18, 2015
Individual debtors may seek discharge of their financial obligations under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In a Chapter 7 proceeding, the debtors assets are transferred to a bankruptcy estate.

11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1).  The estates assets are then promptly liquidated, 704(a)(1), and distributed to creditors, 726.  A Chapter 7 estate, however, does not include the wages a debtor earns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.  541(a)(1).  Chapter 13, a wholly voluntary alternative to Chapter 7, permits the debtor to retain assets during bankruptcy subject to a court-approved plan for payment of his debts.  Payments under a Chapter 13 plan are usually made from a debtors future income.  1322(a)(1).  The Chapter 13 estate, unlike a Chapter 7 estate, therefore includes both the debtors property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and any assets he acquires after filing. 1306(a).  Because many debtors fail to complete a Chapter 13 plan successfully, Congress accorded debtors a nonwaivable right to convert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter 7 at any time.  1307(a).  Conversion does not commence a new bankruptcy case, but it does terminate the service of the Chapter 13 trustee.  348(e).
Petitioner Harris, indebted to multiple creditors and $3,700 behind on his home mortgage payments to Chase Manhattan, filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.  His court-confirmed plan provided that he would resume making monthly mortgage payments to Chase, and that $530 per month would be withheld from his postpetition wages and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent Viegelahn.  Trustee Viegelahn would make monthly payments to Chase to pay down Harris mortgage arrears, and distribute remaining funds to Harris other creditors.  When Harris again fell behind on his mortgage pay-ments, Chase foreclosed on his home.  Following the foreclosure, Viegelahn continued to receive $530 per month from Harris wages, but stopped making the payments earmarked for Chase.  As a result, funds formerly reserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahns possession.  Approximately a year after the foreclosure, Harris converted his case to Chapter 7.  Ten days after this conversion, Viegelahn distributed $5,519.22 in Harris withheld wages mainly to Harris creditors.  Asserting that Viegelahn lacked authority to disburse his postpetition wages to creditors postconversion, Harris sought an order from the Bankruptcy Court directing refund of the accumulated wages Viegelahn paid to his creditors.  The Bankruptcy Court granted Harris motion, and the District Court affirmed.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that a former Chapter 13 trustee must distribute a debtors accumulated postpetition wages to his creditors.
Held:A debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any postpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee.  Pp.511.
(a)Absent a bad-faith conversion, 348(f) limits a converted Chapter 7 estate to property belonging to the debtor as of the date the original Chapter 13 petition was filed.  Because postpetition wages do not fit that bill, undistributed wages collected by a Chapter 13 trustee ordinarily do not become part of a converted Chapter 7 estate.  Pp.56.
(b)By excluding postpetition wages from the converted Chapter 7 estate (absent a bad-faith conversion), 348(f) removes those earnings from the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distributed to creditors.  Allowing a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to disburse the very same earnings to the very same creditors is incompatible with that statutory design.  Pp. 78.
(c)This conclusion is reinforced by 348(e), which terminates the service of [the Chapter 13] trustee upon conversion.  One service provided by a Chapter 13 trustee is disbursing payments to creditors.  1326(c).  The moment a case is converted from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, a Chapter 13 trustee is stripped of authority to provide that service.  P. 8.
(d)Section 1327(a), which provides that a confirmed Chapter 13 plan bind[s] the debtor and each creditor, and 1326(a)(2), which instructs a trustee to distribute payment[s] in accordance with the plan, ceased to apply once the case was converted to Chapter 7.  103(i).  Sections 1327(a) and 1326(a)(2), therefore, offer no support for Viegelahns assertion that the Bankruptcy Code requires a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to distribute to creditors postpetition wages remaining in the trustees possession.  Continuing to distribute funds to creditors pursuant to a defunct Chapter 13 plan, moreover, is not one of the trustees postconversion responsibilities specified by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.  Pp.810.
(e)Because Chapter 13 is a voluntary alternative to Chapter 7, a debtors postconversion receipt of a fraction of the wages he earned and would have kept had he filed under Chapter 7 in the first place does not provide the debtor with a windfall.  A trustee who distributes payments regularly may have little or no accumulated wages to return, while a trustee who distributes payments infrequently may have a sizable refund to make.  But creditors may gain protection against the risk of excess accumulations in the hands of trustees by seeking to have a Chapter 13 plan include a schedule for regular disbursement of collected funds.  Pp.1011.

			Harris filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. His court-confirmed plan provided that he would make monthly mortgage payments to Chase, and that $530 per month would be withheld from his post-petition wages and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, Viegelah, to pay down the mortgage arrearage, with remaining funds to other creditors.

A year after the foreclosure, Harris converted his case to Chapter 7. Viegelahn distributed $5,519.22 in accumulated withheld wages mainly to creditors. Harris obtained an order directing refund. The Fifth Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed: A debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of post-petition wages not distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee.

BULLARD v. BLUE HILLS BANK, fka HYDE PARK SAVINGS BANK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 14116.Argued April 1, 2015Decided  May 4, 2015
After filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, petitioner Bullard submitted a proposed repayment plan to the Bankruptcy Court.  Respondent Blue Hills Bank, Bullards mortgage lender, objected to the plans treatment of its claim.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained the Banks objection and declined to confirm the plan.  Bullard appealed to the First Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP).  The BAP concluded that the Bankruptcy Courts denial of confirmation was not a final, appealable order, see

28 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), but heard the appeal under a provision permitting interlocutory appeals with leave of the court, 158(a)(3), and agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that Bullards proposed plan was not allowed.  Bullard appealed to the First Circuit, but it dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  It concluded that its jurisdiction depended on the finality of the BAPs order, which in turn depended on the finality of the Bankruptcy Courts order.  And it found that the Bankruptcy Courts order denying confirmation was not final so long as Bullard remained free to propose another plan.
Held:A bankruptcy courts order denying confirmation of a debtors proposed repayment plan is not a final order that the debtor can immediately appeal.  Pp.412.
(a)Congress has long treated orders in bankruptcy cases as immediately appealable if they finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case, Howard Delivery Service, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co.,

547 U.S. 651
, n.3.  This approach is reflected in the current statute, which provides that bankruptcy appeals as of right may be taken not only from final judgments in cases but from final judgments, orders, and decrees ... in cases and proceedings.

28 U.S.C. 158(a).  Bullard argues that a bankruptcy court conducts a separate proceeding each time it reviews a proposed plan, and therefore a courts order either confirming or denying a plan terminates the proceeding and is final and immediately appealable.  But the relevant proceeding is the entire process of attempting to arrive at an approved plan that would allow the bankruptcy case to move forward.  Only plan confirmation, or case dismissal, alters the status quo and fixes the parties rights and obligations; denial of confirmation with leave to amend changes little and can hardly be described as final.  Additional considerationsthat the statute defining core bankruptcy proceedings lists confirmations of plans, 157(b)(2)(L), but omits any reference to denials; that immediate appeals from denials would result in delays and inefficiencies that requirements of finality are designed to constrain; and that a debtors inability to immediately appeal a denial encourages the debtor to work with creditors and the trustee to develop a confirmable planbolster the conclusion that the relevant proceeding is the entire process culminating in confirmation or dismissal.  Pp.48.
(b)The Solicitor General suggests that because bankruptcy disputes are generally classified as either adversary proceedings or contested matters, and because an order denying confirmation and an order granting confirmation both resolve a contested matter, both should be considered final.  This argument simply assumes that confirmation is appealable because it resolves a contested matter, and that therefore anything else that resolves the contested matter must also be appealable.  But one could just as easily contend that confirmation is appealable because it resolves the entire plan consideration process, while denial is not because it does not.  Any asymmetry in denying the debtor an immediate appeal from a denial while allowing a creditor an immediate appeal from a confirmation simply reflects the fact that confirmation allows the bankruptcy to go forward and alters the legal relationships among the parties, while denial lacks such significant consequences.  Nor is it clear that the asymmetry will always advantage creditors.  Finally, Bullard contends that unless denial orders are final, a debtor will be required to choose between two untenable options: either accept dismissal of the case and then appeal, or propose an amended but unwanted plan and appeal its confirmation.  These options will often be unsatisfying, but our litigation system has long accepted that certain burdensome rulings will be only imperfectly reparable by the appellate process.

.  That prospect is made tolerable by the Courts confidence that bankruptcy courts rule correctly most of the time and by the existence of several mechanisms for interlocutory review, e.g., 158(a)(3), (d)(2), which serve as useful safety valves for promptly correcting serious errors and resolving legal questions important enough to be addressed immediately.

MACH MINING, LLC v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 131019.Argued January 13, 2015Decided April 29, 2015
Before suing an employer for employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) must first endeavor to eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.

42 U.S.C. 2000e5(b).  Once the Commission determines that conciliation has failed, it may file suit in federal court.  2000e5(f)(1).  However, [n]othing said or done during conciliation may be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without written consent of the persons concerned.  2000e5(b).

            
        
            
        After investigating a sex discrimination charge against petitioner Mach Mining, LLC, respondent EEOC determined that reasonable cause existed to believe that the company had engaged in unlawful hiring practices.  The Commission sent a letter inviting Mach Mining and the complainant to participate in informal conciliation proceedings and notifying them that a representative would be contacting them to begin the process.  About a year later, the Commission sent Mach Mining another letter stating that it had determined that conciliation efforts had been unsuccessful.  The Commission then sued Mach Mining in federal court.  In its answer, Mach Mining alleged that the Commission had not attempted to conciliate in good faith.  The Commission countered that its conciliation efforts were not subject to judicial review and that, regardless, the two letters it sent to Mach Mining provided adequate proof that it had fulfilled its statutory duty.  The District Court agreed that it could review the adequacy of the Commissions efforts, but granted the Commission leave to immediately appeal.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the Commissions statutory conciliation obligation was unreviewable.
Held:

            
        1.Courts have authority to review whether the EEOC has fulfilled its Title VII duty to attempt conciliation.  This Court has recognized a strong presumption that Congress means to allow judicial review of administrative action.  Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,

476 U.S. 667
.  That presumption is rebuttable when a statutes language or structure demonstrates that Congress intended an agency to police itself.  Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,

467 U.S. 340
.  But nothing rebuts that presumption here.  

            
        By its choice of language, Congress imposed a mandatory duty on the EEOC to attempt conciliation and made that duty a precondition to filing a lawsuit.  Such compulsory prerequisites are routinely enforced by courts in Title VII litigation.  And though Congress gave the EEOC wide latitude to choose which informal methods to use, it did not deprive courts of judicially manageable criteria by which to review the conciliation process.  By its terms, the statutory obligation to attempt conciliation necessarily entails communication between the parties concerning the alleged unlawful employment practice.  The statute therefore requires the EEOC to notify the employer of the claim and give the employer an opportunity to discuss the matter.  In enforcing that statutory condition, a court applies a manageable standard.  Pp.48.

            
        2.The appropriate scope of judicial review of the EEOCs conciliation activities is narrow, enforcing only the EEOCs statutory obligation to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve voluntary compliance.  This limited review respects the expansive discretion that Title VII gives the EEOC while still ensuring that it follows the law.

            
        The Governments suggestion that review be limited to checking the facial validity of its two letters to Mach Mining falls short of Title VIIs demands.  That standard would merely accept the EEOCs word that it followed the law, whereas the aim of judicial review is to verify that the EEOC actually tried to conciliate a discrimination charge.  Citing the standard set out in the National Labor Relations Act, Mach Mining proposes review for whether the EEOC engaged in good-faith negotiation, laying out a number of specific requirements to implement that standard.  But the NLRAs process-based approach provides a poor analogy for Title VII, which ultimately cares about substantive outcomes and eschews any reciprocal duty to negotiate in good faith.  Mach Minings proposed code of conduct also conflicts with the wide latitude Congress gave the Commission to decide how to conduct and when to end conciliation efforts.  And because information obtained during conciliation would be necessary evidence in a good-faith determination proceeding, Mach Minings brand of review would violate Title VIIs confidentiality protections.

            
        The proper scope of review thus matches the terms of Title VIIs conciliation provision.  In order to comply with that provision, the EEOC must inform the employer about the specific discrimination allegation.  Such notice must describe what the employer has done and which employees (or class of employees) have suffered.  And the EEOC must try to engage the employer in a discussion in order to give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice.  A sworn affidavit from the EEOC stating that it has performed these obligations should suffice to show that it has met the conciliation requirement.  Should the employer present concrete evidence that the EEOC did not provide the requisite information about the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliating the claim, a court must conduct the factfinding necessary to resolve that limited dispute.  Should it find for the employer, the appropriate remedy is to order the EEOC to undertake the mandated conciliation efforts.  Pp.814.

The Court rejected Machs proposal for specific requirements or a code of conduct as conflicting with the wide latitude Congress gave EEOC and with Title VIIs confidentiality protections. A sworn affidavit from EEOC that it informed the employer about the specific discrimination allegation and tried to engage the employer in a discussion to give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice should suffice. Should the employer present concrete evidence that the EEOC did not provide the requisite information or attempt to engage in conciliation, a court must conduct the fact-finding necessary to resolve that limited dispute.

WILLIAMS-YULEE v. FLORIDA BAR
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 131499.Argued January 20, 2015Decided April 29, 2015
Florida is one of 39 States where voters elect judges at the polls.  To promote public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, the Florida Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) of its Code of Judicial Conduct, which provides that judicial candidates shall not personally solicit campaign funds ... but may establish committees of responsible persons to raise money for election campaigns. 

            
        
            
        Petitioner Lanell Williams-Yulee (Yulee) mailed and posted online a letter soliciting financial contributions to her campaign for judicial office.  The Florida Bar disciplined her for violating a Florida Bar Rule requiring candidates to comply with Canon 7C(1), but Yulee contended that the
 
First Amendment protects a judicial candidates right to personally solicit campaign funds in an election.  The Florida Supreme Court upheld the disciplinary sanctions, concluding that Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to serve the States compelling interest.  
Held: The judgment is affirmed. 
138 So. 3d 379, affirmed.

            
        Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II, concluding that the
 
First Amendment permits Canon 7C(1)s ban on the personal solicitation of campaign funds by judicial candidates.  Pp.822.

            
        (a) Floridas interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of its judiciary is compelling.  The State may conclude that judges, charged with exercising strict neutrality and independence, cannot supplicate campaign donors without diminishing public confidence in judicial integrity.  Simply put, the public may lack confidence in a judges ability to administer justice without fear or favor if he comes to office by asking for favors.  This Courts precedents have recognized the vital state interest in safeguarding public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the nations elected judges, Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co.,

556 U.S. 868
.  Unlike the legislature or the executive, the judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse, Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (A. Hamilton), so its authority depends in large measure on the publics willingness to respect and follow its decisions.  Public perception of judicial integrity is accordingly a state interest of the highest order.  556 U.S., at 889.

            
        A States interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of its judiciary extends beyond its interest in preventing the appearance of corruption in legislative and executive elections, because a judges role differs from that of a politician.  Republican Party of Minn. v. White,

536 U.S. 765
.  Unlike a politician, who is expected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences of supporters, a judge in deciding cases may not follow the preferences of his supporters or provide any special consideration to his campaign donors.  As in White, therefore, precedents applying the
 
First Amendment to political elections have little bearing on the issues here.

            
        The vast majority of elected judges in States allowing personal solicitation serve with fairness and honor, but in the eyes of the public, a judicial candidates personal solicitation could result (even unknowingly) in a possible temptation ... which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.  Tumey v. Ohio,

273 U.S. 510
.  That risk is especially pronounced where most donors are lawyers and litigants who may appear before the judge they are supporting.  In short, it is the regrettable but unavoidable appearance that judges who personally ask for money may diminish their integrity that prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most other States to sever the direct link between judicial candidates and campaign contributors.  Pp.912.

            
        (b)Canon 7C(1) raises no fatal underinclusivity concerns.  The solicitation ban aims squarely at the conduct most likely to undermine public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal requests for money by judges and judicial candidates.  The Canon applies evenhandedly to all judges and judicial candidates, regardless of viewpoint or means of solicitation.  And unlike some laws that have been found impermissibly underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled with exceptions.

            
        Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that allows solicitation by a candidates campaign committee.  But Florida, along with most other States, has reasonably concluded that solicitation by the candidate personally creates a categorically different and more severe risk of undermining public confidence than does solicitation by a campaign committee.  When the judicial candidate himself asks for money, the stakes are higher for all involved.  A judicial candidate asking for money places his name and reputation behind the request, and the solicited individual knows that the same person who signed the fundraising letter might one day sign the judgment.  This dynamic inevitably creates pressure for the recipient to comply, in a way that solicitation by a third party does not.  Just as inevitably, the personal involvement of the candidate in the solicitation creates the public appearance that the candidate will remember who says yes, and who says no.  However similar the two solicitations may be in substance, a State may conclude that they present markedly different appearances to the public.  

            
        Permitting a judicial candidate to write thank you notes to campaign donors likewise does not detract from the States interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.  The States compelling interest is implicated most directly by the candidates personal solicitation itself.  A failure to ban thank you notes for contributions not solicited by the candidate does not undercut the Bars rationale.

            
        In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing candidates to write thank you notes and raise money through committees.  These accommodations reflect Floridas effort to respect the
 
First Amendment interests of candidates and their contributorsto resolve the fundamental tension between the ideal character of the judicial office and the real world of electoral politics.  Chisom v. Roemer,

501 U.S. 380
.  The State should not be punished for leaving open more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially when there is no indication of a pretextual motive for the selective restriction of speech.  Pp.1216.

            
        (c)Canon 7C(1) is also not overinclusive.  By any measure, it restricts a narrow slice of speech.  It leaves judicial candidates free to discuss any issue with any person at any time; to write letters, give speeches, and put up billboards; to contact potential supporters in person, on the phone, or online; and to promote their campaigns through the media.  Though they cannot ask for money, they can direct their campaign committees to do so.  

            
        Yulee concedes that Canon 7C(1) is valid in numerous applications, but she contends that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied to her chosen form of solicitation: a letter posted online and distributed via mass mailing.  This argument misperceives the breadth of the compelling interest underlying Canon 7C(1).  Florida has reasonably determined that personal appeals for money by a judicial candidate inherently create an appearance of impropriety that may cause the public to lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.  That interest may be implicated to varying degrees in particular contexts, but the interest remains whenever the public perceives the judge person-ally asking for money.  Canon 7C(1) must be narrowly tailored, not perfectly tailored.  Burson v. Freeman,

504 U.S. 191
.  The
 
First Amendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in their most acute form.  Here, Florida has concluded that all personal solicitations by judicial candidates create a public appearance that undermines confidence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all personal solicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to address that concern.

            
        Yulee errs in contending that Florida can accomplish its compelling interest through recusal rules and campaign contribution limits.  A rule requiring recusal in every case in which a lawyer or litigant made a campaign contribution would disable many jurisdictions, and a flood of postelection recusal motions could exacerbate the very appearance problem the State is trying to solve.  As for contribution limits, Florida already applies them to judicial elections, and this Court has never held that adopting such limits precludes a State from pursuing its compelling interests through additional means.

            
        The desirability of judicial elections is a question that has sparked disagreement for more than 200 years, but it is not the Courts place to resolve that enduring debate.  The Courts limited task is to apply the Constitution to the question presented in this case.  Judicial candidates have a
 
First Amendment right to speak in support of their campaigns.  States have a compelling interest in preserving public confidence in their judiciaries.  When the State adopts a narrowly tailored restriction like the one at issue here, those principles do not conflict.  A States decision to elect judges does not compel it to compromise public confidence in their integrity.  Pp.1622.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13-1074.Argued December 10, 2014Decided  April 22, 2015[1]
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that a tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless the claimant meets two deadlines.  First, a claim must be presented to the appropriate federal agency for administrative review within two years after [the] claim accrues.

28 U.S.C. 2401(b).  Second, if the agency denies the claim, the claimant may file suit in federal court within six months of the agencys denial.  Ibid.

            
        
            
        Kwai Fun Wong and Marlene June, respondents in Nos. 131074 and 13-1075, respectively, each missed one of those deadlines.  Wong failed to file her FTCA claim in federal court within 6 months, but argued that that was only because the District Court had not permitted her to file that claim until after the period expired.  June failed to present her FTCA claim to a federal agency within 2 years, but argued that her untimely filing should be excused because the Government had, in her view, concealed facts vital to her claim.  In each case, the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim for failure to satisfy 2401(b)s time bars, holding that, despite any justification for delay, those time bars are jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in both cases, concluding that 2401(b)s time bars may be equitably tolled.
Held: Section 2401(b)s time limits are subject to equitable tolling.  Pp.418.

            
        (a) Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,

498 U.S. 89
, provides the framework for deciding the applicability of equitable tolling to statutes of limitations on suits against the Government.  There, the Court adopted a rebuttable presumption that such time bars may be equitably tolled.  Id., at 95.  Irwins presumption may, of course, be rebutted.  One way to do sopursued by the Government hereis to demonstrate that the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdictional; if so, the statute cannot be equitably tolled.  But this Court will not conclude that a time bar is jurisdictional unless Congress provides a clear statement to that effect.  Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  And in applying that clear statement rule, this Court has said that most time bars, even if mandatory and emphatic, are nonjurisdictional.  See id., at ___.  Congress thus must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it.  Pp.47.

            
        (b) Congress did no such thing in enacting 2401(b).  The text of that provision speaks only to a claims timeliness; it does not refer to the jurisdiction of the district courts or address those courts authority to hear untimely suits.  See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,

546 U.S. 500
.  Instead, it reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.  Holland v. Florida,

560 U.S. 631
.  Statutory context confirms that reading.  Congresss separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is not jurisdictional, and here the FTCAs jurisdictional grant appears not in 2401(b) but in another section of Title 28, 1346(b)(1).  That jurisdictional grant is not expressly conditioned on compliance with 2401(b)s limitations periods.  Finally, assuming it could provide the clear statement that this Courts cases require, 2401(b)s legislative history does not clearly demonstrate that Congress intended the provision to impose a jurisdictional bar.  Pp.79.

            
        (c) The Governments two principal arguments for treating 2401(b) as jurisdictional are unpersuasive and foreclosed by this Courts precedents.  Pp.917.

            
        
            
        (1) The Government first points out that 2401(b) includes the same shall be forever barred language as the statute of limitations governing Tucker Act claims, which this Court has held to be jurisdictional.  See, e.g., Kendall v. United States,

107 U.S. 123
126.  But that phrase was a commonplace in statutes of limitations enacted around the time of the FTCA, and it does not carry talismanic jurisdictional significance.  Indeed, this Court has construed the same language to be subject to tolling in the Clayton Acts statute of limitations.  See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah,

414 U.S. 538
.  And in two decisions addressing the Tucker Acts statute of limitations, the Court has dismissed the idea that that language is jurisdictionally significant.  See Irwin, 498 U.S., at 95; John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,

552 U.S. 130
.  The shall be forever barred phrase is thus nothing more than an ordinary way to set a statutory deadline.  Pp.914.

            
        
            
        (2) The Government next argues that 2401(b) is jurisdictional because it is a condition on the FTCAs waiver of sovereign immunity.  But that argument is foreclosed by Irwin, which considered an identical objection but concluded that even time limits that condition a waiver of immunity may be equitably tolled.  See 498 U.S., at 9596.  The Governments invocation of sovereign immunity principles is also peculiarly inapt here.  Unlike other waivers of sovereign immunity, the FTCA treats the Government much like a private party, and the Court has accordingly declined to construe the Act narrowly merely because it waives the Governments immunity from suit.  There is no reason to do differently here.  Pp.1417.
No. 13-1074, 732 F.3d 1030, and No. 13-1075, 550 Fed. Appx. 505, affirmed and remanded.

The Ninth Circuit reversed in both cases, concluding that 2401(b)s time bars may be equitably tolled.
Held: Section 2401(b)s time limits are subject to equitable tolling.  Pp.418.

            
        (a) Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,

498 U.S. 89
, provides the framework for deciding the applicability of equitable tolling to statutes of limitations on suits against the Government.  There, the Court adopted a rebuttable presumption that such time bars may be equitably tolled.  Id., at 95.  Irwins presumption may, of course, be rebutted.  One way to do sopursued by the Government hereis to demonstrate that the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdictional; if so, the statute cannot be equitably tolled.  But this Court will not conclude that a time bar is jurisdictional unless Congress provides a clear statement to that effect.  Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. ___, ___.  And in applying that clear statement rule, this Court has said that most time bars, even if mandatory and emphatic, are nonjurisdictional.  See id., at ___.  Congress thus must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it.  Pp.47.

            
        (b) Congress did no such thing in enacting 2401(b).  The text of that provision speaks only to a claims timeliness; it does not refer to the jurisdiction of the district courts or address those courts authority to hear untimely suits.  See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,

546 U.S. 500
.  Instead, it reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.  Holland v. Florida,

560 U.S. 631
.  Statutory context confirms that reading.  Congresss separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is not jurisdictional, and here the FTCAs jurisdictional grant appears not in 2401(b) but in another section of Title 28, 1346(b)(1).  That jurisdictional grant is not expressly conditioned on compliance with 2401(b)s limitations periods.  Finally, assuming it could provide the clear statement that this Courts cases require, 2401(b)s legislative history does not clearly demonstrate that Congress intended the provision to impose a jurisdictional bar.  Pp.79.

            
        (c) The Governments two principal arguments for treating 2401(b) as jurisdictional are unpersuasive and foreclosed by this Courts precedents.  Pp.917.

            
        
            
        (1) The Government first points out that 2401(b) includes the same shall be forever barred language as the statute of limitations governing Tucker Act claims, which this Court has held to be jurisdictional.  See, e.g., Kendall v. United States,

107 U.S. 123
126.  But that phrase was a commonplace in statutes of limitations enacted around the time of the FTCA, and it does not carry talismanic jurisdictional significance.  Indeed, this Court has construed the same language to be subject to tolling in the Clayton Acts statute of limitations.  See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah,

414 U.S. 538
.  And in two decisions addressing the Tucker Acts statute of limitations, the Court has dismissed the idea that that language is jurisdictionally significant.  See Irwin, 498 U.S., at 95; John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,

552 U.S. 130
.  The shall be forever barred phrase is thus nothing more than an ordinary way to set a statutory deadline.  Pp.914.

            
        
            
        (2) The Government next argues that 2401(b) is jurisdictional because it is a condition on the FTCAs waiver of sovereign immunity.  But that argument is foreclosed by Irwin, which considered an identical objection but concluded that even time limits that condition a waiver of immunity may be equitably tolled.  See 498 U.S., at 9596.  The Governments invocation of sovereign immunity principles is also peculiarly inapt here.  Unlike other waivers of sovereign immunity, the FTCA treats the Government much like a private party, and the Court has accordingly declined to construe the Act narrowly merely because it waives the Governments immunity from suit.  There is no reason to do differently here.  Pp.1417.
No. 13-1074, 732 F.3d 1030, and No. 13-1075, 550 Fed. Appx. 505, affirmed and remanded.

			The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that a tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless presented to the appropriate federal agency for review within two years after the claim accrues, 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). If the agency denies the claim, the claimant may file suit in federal court within six months of the denial. Wong failed to file her FTCA claim in federal court within six months, but argued that the district court had not permitted her to file until after the period expired. June failed to present her FTCA claim to a federal agency within two years, but argued that her untimely filing should be excused because the government concealed facts vital to her claim. In each case, the district court dismissed the FTCA claim, holding that those time bars are jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court affirmed and remanded. Section 2401(b)s time limits are subject to equitable tolling. Congress must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and prohibit a court from tolling it, but did no such thing in section 2401(b). Separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is not jurisdictional; the FTCAs jurisdictional grant appears in another section and is not expressly linked to the limitations periods. The phrase shall be forever barred was commonplace in statutes of limitations enacted around the time of the FTCA, and does not carry jurisdictional significance.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
ONEOK, INC., etal.  v. LEARJET, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 13271.Argued January 12, 2015Decided April 21, 2015
Respondents, a group of manufacturers, hospitals, and other institutions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines, sued petitioner interstate pipelines, claiming that the pipelines had engaged in behavior that violated state antitrust laws.  In particular, respondents alleged that petitioners reported false information to the natural-gas indices on which respondents natural-gas contracts were based.  The indices affected not only retail natural-gas prices, but also wholesale natural-gas prices. 

            
        
            
        After removing the cases to federal court, the petitioner pipelines sought summary judgment on the ground that the Natural Gas Act pre-empted respondents state-law claims.  That Act gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to determine whether rates charged by natural-gas companies or practices affecting such rates are unreasonable.

15 U.S.C. 717d(a).  But it also limits FERCs jurisdiction to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale, and natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale.  717(b).  The Act leaves regulation of other portions of the industrysuch as retail salesto the States.  Ibid.

            
        
            
        The District Court granted petitioners motion for summary judgment, reasoning that because petitioners challenged practices directly affected wholesale as well as retail prices, they were pre-empted by the Act.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  While acknowledging that the pipelines index manipulation increased wholesale prices as well as retail prices, it held that the state-law claims were not pre-empted because they were aimed at obtaining damages only for excessively high retail prices.
Held:Respondents state-law antitrust claims are not within the field of matters pre-empted by the Natural Gas Act.  Pp.1016.

            
        (a)The Act was drawn with meticulous regard for the continued exercise of state power.  Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Serv. Commn of Ind.,

332 U.S. 507
518.  Where, as here, a practice affects nonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales, pre-emption can be found only where a detailed examination convincingly demonstrates that a matter falls within the pre-empted field as defined by this Courts precedents.  Those precedents emphasize the importance of considering the target at which the state-law claims aim.  See, e.g., Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Commn of Kan., 

372 U.S. 84
; Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v. State Corporation Commn of Kan.,

489 U.S. 493
.  Here, respondents claims are aimed at practices affecting retail prices, a matter firmly on the States side of [the] dividing line.  Id., at 514.

Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co.,

485 U.S. 293
, is not to the contrary.  That opinion explains that the Act does not pre-empt traditional state regulation, such as blue sky laws.  Id., at 308, n.11.  Antitrust laws, like blue sky laws, are not aimed at natural-gas companies in particular, but rather all businesses in the marketplace.  The broad applicability of state antitrust laws supports a finding of no pre-emption here.

            
        So, too, does the fact that States have long provided common-law and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices, California v. ARC America Corp.,

490 U.S. 93
.  As noted earlier, the Act circumscribes FERCs powers and preserves traditional areas of state authority.  717(b).  Pp.1014.

            
        (b)Neither Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore,

487 U.S. 354
, nor FPC v. Louisiana Power & Light Co.,

406 U.S. 621
, supports petitioners position.  Mississippi Power is best read as a conflict pre-emption case, not a field pre-emption case.  In any event, the state inquiry in Mississippi Power was pre-empted because it was directed at jurisdictional sales in a way that respondents state antitrust suits are not.  Louisiana Power is also a conflict pre-emption case, and thus does not significantly help petitioners field pre-emption argument.  Pp.1415.

            
        (c)Because the parties have not argued conflict pre-emption, questions involving conflicts between state antitrust proceedings and the federal rate-setting process are left for the lower courts to resolve in the first instance.  Pp.1516.

            
        (d)While petitioners and the Government argue that this Court should defer to FERCs determination that field pre-emption bars respondents claims, they fail to point to a specific FERC determination that state antitrust claims fall within the field pre-empted by the Natural Gas Act.  Thus, this Court need not consider what legal effect such a determination might have.  P.16.

RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 139972.Argued January 21, 2015Decided April 21, 2015
Officer Struble, a K9 officer, stopped petitioner Rodriguez for driving on a highway shoulder, a violation of Nebraska law.  After Struble attended to everything relating to the stop, including, inter alia, checking the drivers licenses of Rodriguez and his passenger and issuing a warning for the traffic offense, he asked Rodriguez for permission to walk his dog around the vehicle.  When Rodriguez refused, Struble detained him until a second officer arrived.  Struble then retrieved his dog, who alerted to the presence of drugs in the vehicle.  The ensuing search revealed methamphetamine.  Seven or eight minutes elapsed from the time Struble issued the written warning until the dog alerted. 

            
        
            
        Rodriguez was indicted on federal drug charges.  He moved to suppress the evidence seized from the vehicle on the ground, among others, that Struble had prolonged the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion in order to conduct the dog sniff.  The Magistrate Judge recommended denial of the motion.  He found no reasonable suspicion supporting detention once Struble issued the written warning.  Under Eighth Circuit precedent, however, he concluded that prolonging the stop by seven to eight minutes for the dog sniff was only a de minimis intrusion on Rodriguezs
 
Fourth Amendment rights and was for that reason permissible.  The District Court then denied the motion to suppress.  Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was sentenced to five years in prison.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Noting that the seven or eight minute delay was an acceptable de minimis intrusion on Rodriguezs personal liberty, the court declined to reach the question whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to continue Rodriguezs detention after issuing the written warning.
Held:

            
        
            
        1.Absent reasonable suspicion, police extension of a traffic stop in order to conduct a dog sniff violates the Constitutions shield against unreasonable seizures.  

            
        A routine traffic stop is more like a brief stop under Terry v. Ohio,

392 U.S. 1
, than an arrest, see, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson,

555 U.S. 323
.  Its tolerable duration is determined by the seizures mission, which is to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop, Illinois v. Caballes,

543 U.S. 405
 and attend to related safety concerns.  Authority for the seizure ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction areor reasonably should have beencompleted.  The
 
Fourth Amendment may tolerate certain unrelated investigations that do not lengthen the roadside detention, Johnson, 555 U.S., at 327328 (questioning); Caballes, 543 U.S., at 406, 408 (dog sniff), but a traffic stop become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete th[e] mission of issuing a warning ticket, id., at 407.

            
        Beyond determining whether to issue a traffic ticket, an officers mission during a traffic stop typically includes checking the drivers license, determining whether there are outstanding warrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobiles registration and proof of insurance.  These checks serve the same objective as enforcement of the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road are operated safely and responsibly.  See Delaware v. Prouse,

440 U.S. 648
659.  Lacking the same close connection to roadway safety as the ordinary inquiries, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the officers traffic mission. 

            
        In concluding that the de minimis intrusion here could be offset by the Governments interest in stopping the flow of illegal drugs, the Eighth Circuit relied on Pennsylvania v. Mimms,

434 U.S. 106
.  The Court reasoned in Mimms that the governments legitimate and weighty interest in officer safety outweighed the de minimis additional intrusion of requiring a driver, lawfully stopped, to exit a vehicle, id., at 110111.  The officer-safety interest recognized in Mimms, however, stemmed from the danger to the officer associated with the traffic stop itself.  On-scene investigation into other crimes, in contrast, detours from the officers traffic-control mission and therefore gains no support from Mimms.  

            
        The Governments argument that an officer who completes all traffic-related tasks expeditiously should earn extra time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation is unpersuasive, for a traffic stop prolonged beyond the time in fact needed for the officer to complete his traffic-based inquiries is unlawful, Caballes, 543 U.S., at 407.  The critical question is not whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket, but whether conducting the sniff adds time to the stop.  Pp.58.

            
        
            
        2.The determination adopted by the District Court that detention for the dog sniff was not independently supported by individualized suspicion was not reviewed by the Eighth Circuit.  That question therefore remains open for consideration on remand.  P.9.
741 F.3d 905, vacated and remanded.

            
        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

On-scene investigation into other crimes, in contrast, detours from the officers traffic-control mission and therefore gains no support from Mimms.  

            
        The Governments argument that an officer who completes all traffic-related tasks expeditiously should earn extra time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation is unpersuasive, for a traffic stop prolonged beyond the time in fact needed for the officer to complete his traffic-based inquiries is unlawful, Caballes, 543 U.S., at 407.  The critical question is not whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket, but whether conducting the sniff adds time to the stop.  Pp.58.

            
        
            
        2.The determination adopted by the District Court that detention for the dog sniff was not independently supported by individualized suspicion was not reviewed by the Eighth Circuit.  That question therefore remains open for consideration on remand.  P.9.
741 F.3d 905, vacated and remanded.

			Struble, a K9 officer, stopped Rodriguez for driving on a highway shoulder, a violation of Nebraska law. Struble attended to everything relating to the stop, including checking the drivers licenses of Rodriguez and his passenger and issuing a warning.  He then sought permission to walk his dog around the vehicle. Rodriguez refused. Struble detained him until another officer arrived, then retrieved his dog, who alerted to the presence of drugs. The ensuing search revealed methamphetamine. Seven or eight minutes elapsed from the time Struble issued the warning until the dog alerted. Rodriguez was indicted. He moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that Struble had prolonged the stop without reasonable suspicion. The district court denied the motion. Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, characterizing the delay as a de minimis intrusion on personal liberty. The Supreme Court vacated. Absent reasonable suspicion, extension of a traffic stop in order to conduct a dog sniff constitutes an unreasonable seizure. A routine traffic stop is like a brief Terry stop; its tolerable duration is determined by the mission. Authority for the seizure ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are, or reasonably should be, completed. Lacking the same close connection to roadway safety as the ordinary inquiries, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the traffic mission. An officer who completes all traffic-related tasks expeditiously does not earn extra time to pursue unrelated criminal investigations; the question is not whether the dog sniff occurs before issuance of a ticket, but whether conducting the sniff adds time to the stop. The district court determination that detention for the dog sniff was not independently supported by individualized suspicion was not reviewed by the Eighth Circuit.

                      (a)The Supremacy Clause instructs courts to give federal law priority when state and federal law clash.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210.  But it is not the source of any federal rights, Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles,  493 U.S. 103 , and certainly does not create a cause of action.  Nothing in the Clauses text suggests otherwise, and nothing suggests it was ever understood as conferring a private right of action.  Article I vests Congress with broad discretion over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers.  Art I., 8; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421.  It is unlikely that the Constitution gave Congress broad discretion with regard to the enactment of laws, while simultaneously limiting Congresss power over the manner of their implementation, making it impossible to leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors.  Pp.35.
                      (b) Reading the Supremacy Clause not to confer a private right of action is consistent with this Courts preemption jurisprudence.  The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.  This Court has never held nor suggested that this judge-made remedy, in its application to state officers, rests upon an implied right of action contained in the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.56.

The power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to express and implied statutory limitations.  See, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,  517 U.S. 44 .

14-593|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
TORREY DALE GRADY v. NORTH CAROLINA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina
No. 14593.Decided March 30, 2015
                      Per Curiam.
                      Petitioner Torrey Dale Grady was convicted in North Carolina trial courts of a second degree sexual offense in 1997 and of taking indecent liberties with a child in 2006.  After serving his sentence for the latter crime, Grady was ordered to appear in New Hanover County Superior Court for a hearing to determine whether he should be subjected to satellite-based monitoring (SBM) as a recidivist sex offender.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 14208.40(a)(1), 14208.40B (2013).  Grady did not dispute that his prior convictions rendered him a recidivist under the relevant North Carolina statutes.  He argued, however, that the monitoring programunder which he would be forced to wear tracking devices at all timeswould violate his   Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Unpersuaded, the trial court ordered Grady to enroll in the program and be monitored for the rest of his life.  Record in No. COA13-958 (N.C. App.), pp. 34, 1822.
                      Grady renewed his   Fourth Amendment challenge on appeal, relying on this Court's decision in United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___ (2012).  In that case, this Court held that police officers had engaged in a ""search"" within the meaning of the   Fourth Amendment when they installed and monitored a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking device on a suspect's car.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected Grady's argument, concluding that it was foreclosed by one of its earlier decisions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a7a.  In that decision, coincidentally named State v. Jones, the court had said:
""Defendant essentially argues that if affixing a GPS to an individual's vehicle constitutes a search of the individual, then the arguably more intrusive act of affixing an ankle bracelet to an individual must constitute a search of the individual as well.  We disagree.  The context presented in the instant casewhich involves a civil SBM proceedingis readily distinguishable from that presented in [United States v.] Jones, where the Court considered the propriety of a search in the context of a motion to suppress evidence.  We conclude, therefore, that the specific holding in [United States v.] Jones does not control in the case sub judice.""  ___ N.C. App. ___, ___, 750 S.E. 2d 883, 886 (2013).
                      The court in Grady's case held itself bound by this reasoning and accordingly rejected his   Fourth Amendment challenge.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a7a.  The North Carolina Supreme Court in turn summarily dismissed Grady's appeal and denied his petition for discretionary review.  367 N.C. 523, 762 S.E. 2d 460 (2014).  Grady now asks us to reverse these decisions.[1]
                      The only explanation provided below for the rejection of Grady's challenge is the quoted passage from State v. Jones.  And the only theory we discern in that passage is that the State's system of nonconsensual satellite-based monitoring does not entail a search within the meaning of the   Fourth Amendment.  That theory is inconsistent with this Court's precedents.
                      In United States v. Jones, we held that ""the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a 'search.'""  565 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (footnote omitted).  We stressed the importance of the fact that the Government had ""physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information.""  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Under such circumstances, it was not necessary to inquire about the target's expectation of privacy in his vehicle's movements in order to determine if a   Fourth Amendment search had occurred.  ""Where, as here, the Government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search has undoubtedly occurred.""  Id., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 6, n.3).
                      We reaffirmed this principle in Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. ___, ______ (2013) (slip op., at 34), where we held that having a drug-sniffing dog nose around a suspect's front porch was a search, because police had ""gathered ... information by physically entering and occupying the [curtilage of the house] to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.""  See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (a search occurs ""when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas"").  In light of these decisions, it follows that a State also conducts a search when it attaches a device to a person's body, without consent, for the purpose of tracking that individual's movements.
                      In concluding otherwise, the North Carolina Court of Appeals apparently placed decisive weight on the fact that the State's monitoring program is civil in nature.  See Jones, ___ N.C. App., at ___, 750 S.E. 2d, at 886 (""the instant case ... involves a civil SBM proceeding"").  ""It is well settled,"" however, ""that the   Fourth Amendment's protection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investigations,"" Ontario v. Quon,  560 U.S. 746, 755 (2010) , and the government's purpose in collecting information does not control whether the method of collection constitutes a search.  A building inspector who enters a home simply to ensure compliance with civil safety regulations has undoubtedly conducted a search under the   Fourth Amendment.  See Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco,  387 U.S. 523, 534 (1967)  (housing inspections are ""administrative searches"" that must comply with the   Fourth Amendment).
                      In its brief in opposition to certiorari, the State faults Grady for failing to introduce ""evidence about the State's implementation of the SBM program or what information, if any, it currently obtains through the monitoring process.""  Brief in Opposition 11.  Without evidence that it is acting to obtain information, the State argues, ""there is no basis upon which this Court can determine whether North Carolina conducts a 'search' of an offender enrolled in its SBM program.""  Ibid. (citing Jones, 565 U.S., at ___, n.5 (slip op., at 7, n.5) (noting that a government intrusion is not a search unless ""done to obtain information"")).  In other words, the State argues that we cannot be sure its program for satellite-based monitoring of sex offenders collects any information.  If the very name of the program does not suffice to rebut this contention, the text of the statute surely does:
""The satellite-based monitoring program shall use a system that provides all of the following:
                      ""(1) Time-correlated and continuous tracking of the geographic location of the subject ....
                      ""(2) Reporting of subject's violations of prescriptive and proscriptive schedule or location requirements.""  N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 14208.40(c).
The State's program is plainly designed to obtain information.  And since it does so by physically intruding on a subject's body, it effects a   Fourth Amendment search.
                      That conclusion, however, does not decide the ultimate question of the program's constitutionality.  The   Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches.  The reasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature and purpose of the search and the extent to which the search intrudes upon reasonable privacy expectations.  See, e.g., Samson v. California,  547 U.S. 843 (2006)  (suspicionless search of parolee was reasonable); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,  515 U.S. 646 (1995)  (random drug testing of student athletes was reasonable).  The North Carolina courts did not examine whether the State's monitoring program is reasonablewhen properly viewed as a searchand we will not do so in the first instance.
                      The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

14-618|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JEFFREY WOODS, WARDEN v. CORY DONALD
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 14618.Decided March 30, 2015
Per Curiam.
                      Federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief if the underlying state-court decision was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by"" this Court.  28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Here, the Sixth Circuit held that respondent Cory Donald's attorney provided perse ineffective assistance of counsel under United States v. Cronic,  466 U.S. 648 (1984) , when he was briefly absent during testimony concerning other defendants.  Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that Donald is entitled to relief under Cronic, we reverse.
I
                      After a day of drinking and smoking marijuana, Cory Donald and four othersSeante Liggins, Rashad Moore, Dewayne Saine, and Fawzi Zayadecided to rob a drug dealer named Mohammed Makki.  Donald, Moore, and Liggins drove to Makki's home in Dearborn, Michigan, wearing black skull caps and coats.  Moore and Donald entered the house, while Liggins waited in the car.
                      Michael McGinnis, one of Makki's drug runners, was in the house at the time.  When Donald and Moore came through the door, McGinnis raised his hands and dropped face-down to the floor.  He heard a scuffle in the kitchen and two gunshots as someone said, ""'[L]et it go.'""  Donald v. Rapelje, 580 Fed. Appx. 277, 279 (CA6 2014).  After that, McGinnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while someone rifled through his pockets saying, ""'[W]hat you got, what you got?'""  Donald v. Rapelje, 2012 WL 6047130, *3 (ED Mich., Dec. 5, 2012).  He also heard one of the two men whisper to the other, ""'I got shot, I got shot.'""  580 Fed. Appx., at 279.  After Moore and Donald left, McGinnis found Makki slumped against the refrigerator dying.
                      About seven minutes after they entered the house, Moore and Donald returned, guns in hand, to Liggins' car.  Donald told the others that he had stolen $320 and that Moore had accidentally shot him during the crime.  That night, Donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound to his foot.  Police arrested him about three weeks later.
                      The State charged Donald with one count of first-degree felony murder and two counts of armed robbery.  Liggins and Zaya pleaded guilty, and Donald was tried with Moore and Saine.  His defense theory was that he was present at the scene of the crime but he did not participate.  At trial, the government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone calls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and Zaya.  Moore and Saine's attorneys objected, but Donald's attorney declined, saying: ""'I don't have a dog in this race.  It does not affect me at all.'""  Id., at 280.  The court admitted the exhibit and took a short recess.
                      When the trial resumed, Donald's counsel was not in the courtroom.  At first, the judge indicated that he would wait for the attorney.  But he then decided to proceed because Donald's counsel had already indicated that the exhibit and testimony did not apply to his client.  About 10 minutes later, the lawyer returned.  The judge informed him that ""'up until that point we only were discussing the telephone chart,'"" to which the attorney replied, ""'[Y]es, your Honor, and as I had indicated on the record, I had no dog in the race and no interest in that.'""  Ibid.
                      The jury found Donald guilty on all three counts.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the felony-murder count and to concurrent prison terms of 10 to 20 years for each of the armed robbery counts.  On appeal, Donald argued that he was entitled to a new trial because his attorney's absence during the phone call testimony denied him his   Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected his claim, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied review.
                      The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted federal habeas relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  The Sixth Circuit held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's decision in Cronic.  In the normal course, defendants claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the familiar framework of Strickland v. Washington,  466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) , which requires a showing that ""counsel's performance was deficient"" and ""that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.""  And when reviewing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, ""a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.""  Id., at 689.
                      In Cronic, however, we held that courts may presume that a defendant has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if he ""is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.""  466 U.S., at 659.  And in Bell v. Cone,  535 U.S. 685, 696 (2002) , we characterized a ""critical stage"" as one that ""held significant consequences for the accused.""  According to the Sixth Circuit, these statements should have compelled the Michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony was a ""critical stage"" and that counsel's absence consti-tuted perse ineffective assistance.  Without identifying any decision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the relevant testimony in this case was ""similar to"" our cases applying Cronic.  580 Fed. Appx., at 284.
II
A
                      Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),  110Stat. 1214, a federal court may grant habeas relief only when a state court's decision on the merits was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by"" decisions from this Court, or was ""based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.""  28 U.S.C. 2254(d).  Donald does not argue that the state-court decision in his case was factually erroneous.  Instead, he argues that the decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel cases.
                      AEDPA's standard is intentionally ""'""difficult to meet.""'""  White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Metrish v. Lancaster, 569 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5)).  We have explained that ""'clearly established Federal law' for purposes of 2254(d)(1) includes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions.""  White, 572 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (some internal quotation marks omitted).  ""And an 'unreasonable application of' those holdings must be objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not suffice.""  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 34) (same).  To satisfy this high bar, a habeas petitioner is required to ""show that the state court's ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.""  Harrington v. Richter,  562 U.S. 83, 103 (2011) .
                      Adherence to these principles serves important interests of federalism and comity.  AEDPA's requirements reflect a ""presumption that state courts know and follow the law.""  Woodford v. Visciotti,  537 U.S. 19, 24 (2002)  (per curiam).  When reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.  Federal habeas review thus exists as ""a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.""  Harrington, supra, at 102103 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is especially true for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where AEDPA review must be ""'""doubly deferential""'"" in order to afford ""both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.""  Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 1) (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster,  563 U.S. 170 , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17)).
B
                      The Sixth Circuit should not have affirmed the Cronic-based grant of habeas relief in this case.  The Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was not contrary to any clearly established holding of this Court.  We have never addressed whether the rule announced in Cronic applies to testimony regarding codefendants' actions.  In Cronic itself, we rejected the defendant's claim that his counsel's lack of experience and short time for preparation warranted a presumption of prejudice, not a claim based on coun-sel's absence.  See 466 U.S., at 663666.  When announcing the rule in Cronic, we cited earlier cases finding prejudice where ""counsel was either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.""  Id., at 659, n. 25.  But none of those cases dealt with circumstances like those present here.  And Bell did not involve the absence of counsel; instead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital defendant's counsel ""failed to 'mount some case for life' after the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement.""  535 U.S., at 696.
                      Because none of our cases confront ""the specific question presented by this case,"" the state court's decision could not be ""contrary to"" any holding from this Court.  Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5).  The most that the Sixth Circuit could muster was that ""[t]he testimony of a government witness is similar to the trial events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical stages.""  580 Fed. Appx., at 284.  But that conclusion is doubly wrong.  First, if the circumstances of a case are only ""similar to"" our precedents, then the state court's decision is not ""contrary to"" the holdings in those cases.  See, e.g., Carey v. Musladin,  549 U.S. 70 77, and n. 2 (2006).  Second, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue at too high a level of generality.  See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The relevant testimony was not merely ""testimony of a government witness""; it was prosecution testimony about other defendants.  To be sure, the Sixth Circuit considered the testimony relevant to Donald because he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting theory for felony murder.  But Donald's position was that he had nothing to do with the planning among his codefendants.  And none of our holdings address counsel's absence during testimony that is irrelevant within the defendant's own theory of the case.
                      Nor was the state court's decision an unreasonable application of our cases.  The Sixth Circuit stated ""that a critical stage of trial is a 'step of a criminal proceeding ... that h[olds] significant consequences for the accused.'""  580 Fed. Appx., at 284 (quoting Bell, supra, at 696).  And it held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was ""objectively unreasonable"" because the phone call evidence might have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the jury.  But that holding is not correct.  Just last Term we warned the Sixth Circuit that ""where the '""precise contours""' of [a] right remain '""unclear,""' state courts enjoy 'broad discretion' in their adjudication of a prisoner's claims.""  White, 572 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade,  538 U.S. 63, 76 (2003) , in turn quoting Harmelin v. Michigan,  501 U.S. 957, 998 (1991)  (Kennedy,J., concurring in part and in judgment)).  Within the contours of Cronic, a fairminded jurist could conclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted by counsel's short absence during testimony about other defendants where that testimony was irrelevant to the defendant's theory of the case.
 Cronic applies in ""circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.""  466 U.S., at 658.  The Michigan Court of Appeals' refusal to apply it to these circumstances was not the ""extreme malfunction"" required for federal habeas relief.  Harrington, 562 U.S., at 102.
III
                      Because we consider this case only in the narrow context of federal habeas review, we ""expres[s] no view on the merits of the underlying   Sixth Amendment principle.""  Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7).  All that matters here, and all that should have mattered to the Sixth Circuit, is that we have not held that Cronic applies to the circumstances presented in this case.  For that reason, federal habeas relief based upon Cronic is unavailable.
                      The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

			Donald, Liggins, Moore, Saine, and Zaya decided to rob a drug dealer (Makki). Donald, Moore, and Liggins drove to Makkis home. Moore and Donald entered. Liggins waited in the car. McGinnis, a drug runner, was present, and dropped to the floor. He heard a scuffle and gunshots. After Moore and Donald left, he found Makki, dying. Moore and Donald returned to the car. Donald stated that he had stolen $320 and that Moore had accidentally shot him. Donald later went to a hospital for the wound. Weeks later, the state charged Donald with first-degree felony murder and two counts of armed robbery. Liggins and Zaya pleaded guilty. Donald was tried with Moore and Saine. His defense was that he was present, but did not participate. The court admitted a chart chronicling phone calls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and Zaya. Donalds attorney did not object, saying: it does not affect me.  When the trial resumed after a recess, Donalds counsel was not in the courtroom. Ten minutes later, the lawyer returned. The judge informed him that we only were discussing the telephone chart. The attorney replied, I had no dog in the race and no interest in that.  Donald was convicted. Michigan courts rejected his claim that his attorneys absence during the phone call testimony denied him effective assistance of counsel. The federal district court granted habeas relief. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, based on the Supreme Courts Cronic holding that courts may presume unconstitutional prejudice if a defendant is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial. The Supreme Court, per curiam, reversed. The state courts decision could not be contrary to any Supreme Court holding; no holding addresses counsels absence during testimony that is irrelevant within the defendants own theory of the case. A fair-minded jurist could conclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted by counsels short absence during testimony about other defendants, irrelevant to the defendants theory.

 Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 12   1226.   Argued December 3, 2014   Decided March 25, 2015
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act added new language to the definitions subsection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The first clause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifies that Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination applies to discrimination ""because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.""  42 U.  S.  C   2000e(k).  The Act's second clause says that employers must treat ""women affected by pregnancy .  .  . the same for all employment-related purposes .  .  . as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.""  Ibid.  This case asks the Court to determine how the latter provision applies in the context of an employer's policy that accommodates many, but not all, workers with nonpregnancy-related disabilities.
                                            Petitioner Young was a part-time driver for respondent United Parcel Service (UPS).  When she became pregnant, her doctor advised her that she should not lift more than 20 pounds.  UPS, however, required drivers like Young to be able to lift up to 70 pounds.  UPS told Young that she could not work while under a lifting restriction.  Young subsequently filed this federal lawsuit, claiming that UPS acted unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting restriction.  She brought only a disparate-treatment claim of discrimination, which a plaintiff can prove either by direct evidence that a workplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a protected characteristic, or by using the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,  411 U.  S. 792 .  Under that framework, the plaintiff has ""the initial burden"" of ""establishing a prima facie case"" of discrimination.  Id., at 802.  If she carries her burden, the employer must have an opportunity ""to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason[s] for"" the difference in treatment.  Ibid.  If the employer articulates such reasons, the plaintiff then has ""an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons .  .  . were a pretext for discrimination.""  Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,  450 U.  S. 248 .
                                            After discovery, UPS sought summary judgment.  In reply, Young presented several favorable facts that she believed she could prove.  In particular, she pointed to UPS policies that accommodated workers who were injured on the job, had disabilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), or had lost Department of Transportation (DOT) certifications.  Pursuant to these policies, Young contended, UPS had accommodated several individuals whose disabilities created work restrictions similar to hers.  She argued that these policies showed that UPS discriminated against its pregnant employees because it had a light-duty-for-injury policy for numerous ""other persons,"" but not for pregnant workers.  UPS responded that, since Young did not fall within the on-the-job injury, ADA, or DOT categories, it had not discriminated against Young on the basis of pregnancy, but had treated her just as it treated all ""other"" relevant ""persons.""
                                            The District Court granted UPS summary judgment, concluding, inter alia, that Young could not make out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas.  The court found that those with whom Young had compared herself   those falling within the on-the-job, DOT, or ADA categories   were too different to qualify as ""similarly situated comparator[s].""  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:  
                      1.  An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate treatment through indirect evidence may do so through application of the McDonnell Douglas framework.  Pp.  10   23.
                                            (a)  The parties' interpretations of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's second clause are unpersuasive.  Pp.  12   20.
                                                                  (i)  Young claims that as long as ""an employer accommodates only a subset of workers with disabling conditions,"" ""pregnant workers who are similar in the ability to work [must] receive the same treatment even if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive accommodations.""  Brief for Petitioner 28.  Her reading proves too much.  The Court doubts that Congress intended to grant pregnant workers an unconditional ""most-favored-nation"" status, such that employers who provide one or two workers with an accommodation must provide similar accommodations to all pregnant workers, irrespective of any other criteria.  After all, the second clause of the Act, when referring to nonpregnant persons with similar disabilities, uses the open-ended term ""other persons.""  It does not say that the employer must treat pregnant employees the ""same"" as ""any other persons"" who are similar in their ability or inability to work, nor does it specify the particular ""other persons"" Congress had in mind as appropriate comparators for pregnant workers.  Moreover, disparate-treatment law normally allows an employer to implement policies that are not intended to harm members of a protected class, even if their implementation sometimes harms those members, as long as the employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual reason for doing so.  See, e.g., Burdine, supra, at 252   258.  There is no reason to think Congress intended its language in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to deviate from that approach.  Pp.  12   14.
                                                                  (ii)  The Solicitor General argues that the Court should give special, if not controlling, weight to a 2014 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guideline concerning the application of Title VII and the ADA to pregnant employees.  But that guideline lacks the timing, ""consistency,"" and ""thoroughness"" of ""consideration"" necessary to ""give it power to persuade.""  Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,  323 U.  S. 134 .  The guideline was promulgated after certiorari was granted here; it takes a position on which previous EEOC guidelines were silent; it is inconsistent with positions long advocated by the Government; and the EEOC does not explain the basis for its latest guidance.  Pp.  14   17.
                                                                  (iii)  UPS claims that the Act's second clause simply defines sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination.  But that cannot be right, as the first clause of the Act accomplishes that objective.  Reading the Act's second clause as UPS proposes would thus render the first clause superfluous.  It would also fail to carry out a key congressional objective in passing the Act.  The Act was intended to overturn the holding and the reasoning of General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,  429 U.  S. 125 , which upheld against a Title VII challenge a company plan that provided nonoccupational sickness and accident benefits to all employees but did not provide disability-benefit payments for any absence due to pregnancy.  Pp.  17   20.
                                            (b)  An individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate treatment may make out a prima facie case under the McDonnell Douglas framework by showing that she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her, and that the employer did accommodate others ""similar in their ability or inability to work.""  The employer may then seek to justify its refusal to accommodate the plaintiff by relying on ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory"" reasons for denying accommodation.  That reason normally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more expensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the category of those whom the employer accommodates.  If the employer offers a ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory"" reason, the plaintiff may show that it is in fact pretextual.  The plaintiff may reach a jury on this issue by providing sufficient evidence that the employer's policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employer's ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory"" reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify the burden, but rather   when considered along with the burden imposed   give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.  The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a significant burden exists by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers.  This approach is consistent with the longstanding rule that a plaintiff can use circumstantial proof to rebut an employer's apparently legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, see Burdine, supra, at 255, n.  10, and with Congress' intent to overrule Gilbert.  Pp.  20   23.
                                            2.  Under this interpretation of the Act, the Fourth Circuit's judgment must be vacated.  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is ""no genuine dispute as to any material fact.""  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  The record here shows that Young created a genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from hers.  It is left to the Fourth Circuit to determine on remand whether Young also created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether UPS' reasons for having treated Young less favorably than these other nonpregnant employees were pretextual.  Pp.  23   24.
707 F.  3d 437, vacated and remanded.

			The Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifies that Title VIIs prohibition against sex discrimination applies to discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, 42 U.S.C 2000e(k), and that employers must treat women affected by pregnancy . . . the same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.  Young, a UPS driver, became pregnant; her doctor advised that she should not lift more than 20 pounds. UPS required drivers to lift up to 70 pounds. UPS told Young that she could not work while under a lifting restriction. Young filed a disparate-treatment claim of discrimination, identifying UPS policies that accommodated workers who were injured on the job, were covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, or had lost Department of Transportation certifications. UPS argued that, since Young did not fall within those categories, it had not discriminated on the basis of pregnancy, but had treated her as it treated all other relevant persons. The district court granted UPS summary judgment. The Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated.  Disparate treatment law normally allows an employer to implement policies that are not intended to harm members of a protected class if the employer has a nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual reason. A pregnant worker can make a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that she sought and was denied accommodation and that the employer did accommodate others similar in their ability or inability to work. The employer may then try to establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, other than that it is more expensive or less convenient to accommodate pregnant women. If the employer offers a reason, the plaintiff may show that it is pretextual. The plaintiff may survive a motion for summary judgment by providing sufficient evidence that the employers policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employers legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify the burden. The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact as to significant burden with evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers. Young created a genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from hers.

appeal from the united states district court for the middle district of alabama
No. 13895.Argued November 12, 2014Decided  March 25,  2015[1]
In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the States 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts.  In doing so, while Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectivese.g., compactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbentsit placed yet greater importance on two goals: (1) minimizing a districts deviation from precisely equal population, by keeping any deviation less than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2) seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice under 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,  52 U.S.C. 10304(b), by maintaining roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts.
                                            AppellantsAlabama Legislative Black Caucus (Caucus), Alabama Democratic Conference (Conference), and othersclaim that Alabamas new district boundaries create a racial gerrymander in violation of the   Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause.  After a bench trial, the three-judge District Court ruled (2 to 1) for the State.  It recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when race is the predominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district, Miller v. Johnson,  515 U.S. 900 , and the use of race is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, Shaw v. Hunt,  517 U.S. 899  (Shaw II).
                                            In ruling against appellants, it made four critical determinations: (1) that both appellants had argued that the Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders, and that the Conference had also argued that the State had racially gerrymandered Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26; (2) that the Conference lacked standing to make its racial gerrymandering claims; (3) that, in any event, appellants claims must fail because race was not the predominant motivating factor in making the redistricting decisions; and (4) that, even were it wrong about standing and predominance, these claims must fail because any predominant use of race was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in avoiding retrogression under 5.
Held:
                      1.The District Courts analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim as referring to the State as a whole, rather than district-by-district, was legally erroneous.  Pp.512.
                                            (a)This Court has consistently described a claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts, see, e.g., Shaw v. Reno,  509 U.S. 630  (Shaw I), and has described the plaintiffs evidentiary burden similarly, see Miller, supra, at 916.  The Courts district-specific language makes sense in light of the personal nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim, see Bush v. Vera,  517 U.S. 952 ; Shaw I, supra, at 648.  Pp.56.
 (b)The District Court found the fact that racial criteria had not predominated in the drawing of some Alabama districts sufficient to defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the State as an undifferentiated whole.  But a showing that race-based criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of some Alabama districts would have done little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria predominantly affected the drawing of other Alabama districts.  Thus, the District Courts undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient, and the District Court must on remand consider racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual districts challenged by appellants.  Pp.78.
                                            (c)The Caucus and the Conference did not waive the right to further consideration of a district-by-district analysis.  The record indicates that plaintiffs evidence and arguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered, and those are the districts that the District Court must reconsider.  Although plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines, neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the State as an undifferentiated whole.  Pp.812.
                      2.The District Court also erred in deciding, suasponte, that the Conference lacked standing.  It believed that the record did not clearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the [Conference] reside.  But the Conferences post-trial brief and the testimony of a Conference representative support an inference that the organization has members in all of the majority-minority districts, which is sufficient to meet the Conferences burden of establishing standing.  At the very least, the Conference reasonably believed that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information, it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list.  While the District Court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, in these circumstances elementary principles of procedural fairness required the District Court, rather than acting suasponte, to give the Conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence.  On remand, the District Court should permit the Conference to file its membership list and the State to respond, as appropriate.  Pp.1215.
                      3.The District Court also did not properly calculate predominance in its alternative holding that [r]ace was not the predominant motivating factor in the creation of any of the challenged districts.  It reached its conclusion in part because it placed in the balance, among other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.  An equal population goal, however, is not one of the traditional factors to be weighed against the use of race to determine whether race predominates, see Miller, supra, at 916.  Rather, it is part of the redistricting background, taken as a given, when determining whether race, or other factors, predominate in a legislators determination as to how equal population objectives will be met.  Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the law, its predominance conclusions, including those concerning the four districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well have been different.  For example, there is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26.  Pp.1519.
                      4.The District Courts final alternative holdingthat the [challenged] Districts would satisfy strict scrutinyrests upon a misperception of the law.  Section 5 does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage.  It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minoritys ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.  Pp.1923.
                                            (a)The statutes language, 52 U.S.C. 10304(b), (d), and Department of Justice Guidelines make clear that 5 is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.  The history of 5 further supports this view, as Congress adopted the language in 5 to reject this Courts decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft,  539 U.S. 461 , and to accept the views of Justice Souters dissentthat, in a 5 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice, and that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances, id., at 493, 498, 505, 509.  Here, both the District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression.  Pp.1922.
                                            (b)In saying this, this Court does not insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority population 5 demands.  A courts analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29.  Here, however, the District Court and the legislature both asked the wrong question with respect to narrow tailoring.  They asked how to maintain the present minority percentages in majority-minority districts, instead of asking the extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minoritys present ability to elect the candidate of its choice.  Because asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer, the Court cannot accept the District Courts conclusion.  Pp.2223.

			In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of its 105 House and 35 Senate districts to minimize each districts deviation from precisely equal population and avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice under the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. 10304(b), by maintaining roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts. The district court rejected an equal protection claim of racial gerrymander.  The Supreme Court vacated. Analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim as referring to the state as a whole, rather than district-by-district, was erroneous. Showing that race-based criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of some districts did not defeat a claim that such criteria predominantly affected the drawing of others. The objectors claimed that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered, and those districts must be reconsidered. There was strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor with respect to one district.  An equal population goal is not a traditional factor in determining whether race predominates, but is taken as a given. The district court and the Alabama legislature relied upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression and asked how to maintain the present minority percentages in majority-minority districts. The Act does not require maintenance of a particular numerical minority percentage. It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minoritys ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.

B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC., dba SEALTITE BUILDING FASTENERS etal., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 13352.Argued December 2, 2014Decided March 24, 2015
Respondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Hargis), tried to register its trademark for SEALTITE with the United States Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to the Lanham Act.  Petitioner, B&B Hardware, Inc. (B&B), however, opposed registration, claiming that SEALTITE is too similar to B&Bs own SEALTIGHT trademark.  The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that SEALTITE should not be registered because of the likelihood of confusion.  Hargis did not seek judicial review of that decision.  

            
        
            
        Later, in an infringement suit before the District Court, B&B argued that Hargis was precluded from contesting the likelihood of confusion because of the TTABs decision.  The District Court disagreed.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that preclusion was unwarranted because the TTAB and the court used different factors to evaluate likelihood of confusion, the TTAB placed too much emphasis on the appearance and sound of the two marks, and Hargis bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB while B&B bore it before the District Court.   
Held:So long as the other ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met, when the usages adjudicated by the TTAB are materially the same as those before a district court, issue preclusion should apply.  Pp.822.

            
        (a)An agency decision can ground issue preclusion.  The Courts cases establish that when Congress authorizes agencies to resolve disputes, courts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with the expectation that [issue preclusion] will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.  Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,

501 U.S. 104
.  Constitutional avoidance does not compel a different conclusion.  Pp.812.

            
         (b)Neither the Lanham Acts text nor its structure rebuts the presumption in favor of giving preclusive effect to TTAB decisions where the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met.  Astoria, 501 U.S., at 108.  This case is unlike Astoria.  There, where exhausting the administrative process was a prerequisite to suit in court, giving preclusive effect to the agencys determination in that very administrative process could have rendered the judicial suit strictly proforma. Id., at 111.  By contrast, registration involves a separate proceeding to decide separate rights.  Pp.1214.

            
        (c)There is no categorical reason why registration decisions can never meet the ordinary elements of issue preclusion.  That many registrations will not satisfy those ordinary elements does not mean that none will. Pp.1522.

            
        
            
        (1)Contrary to the Eighth Circuits conclusion, the same likelihood-of-confusion standard applies to both registration and infringement.  The factors that the TTAB and the Eighth Circuit use to assess likelihood of confusion are not fundamentally different, and, more important, the operative language of each statute is essentially the same.  

            
        Hargis claims that the standards are different, noting that the registration provision asks whether the marks resemble each other,

15 U.S.C. 1052(d), while the infringement provision is directed towards the use in commerce of the marks, 1114(1).  That the TTAB and a district court do not always consider the same usages, however, does not mean that the TTAB applies a different standard to the usages it does consider.  If a mark owner uses its mark in materially the same ways as the usages included in its registration application, then the TTAB is deciding the same likelihood-of-confusion issue as a district court in infringement litigation.  For a similar reason, the Eighth Circuit erred in holding that issue preclusion could not apply because the TTAB relied too heavily on appearance and sound.  Pp.1519.

            
        
            
        (2)The fact that the TTAB and district courts use different procedures suggests only that sometimes issue preclusion might be inappropriate, not that it always is.  Here, there is no categorical reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness, Montana v. United States, 

440 U.S. 147
, 164, n.11, of the agencys procedures.  In large part they are exactly the same as in federal court.  Also contrary to the Eighth Circuits conclusion, B&B, the party opposing registration, not Hargis, bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB, just as it did in the infringement suit.  Pp.1921.

            
        
            
        (3) Hargis is also wrong that the stakes for registration are always too low for issue preclusion in later infringement litigation.  When registration is opposed, there is good reason to think that both sides will take the matter seriously.  Congress creation of an elaborate registration scheme, with many important rights attached and backed up by plenary review, confirms that registration decisions can be weighty enough to ground issue preclusion.  Pp.2122.

B&B HARDWARE, INC. v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC., dba SEALTITE BUILDING FASTENERS etal., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 13352.Argued December 2, 2014Decided March 24, 2015
Respondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Hargis), tried to register its trademark for SEALTITE with the United States Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to the Lanham Act.  Petitioner, B&B Hardware, Inc. (B&B), however, opposed registration, claiming that SEALTITE is too similar to B&Bs own SEALTIGHT trademark.  The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that SEALTITE should not be registered because of the likelihood of confusion.  Hargis did not seek judicial review of that decision.  

            
        
            
        Later, in an infringement suit before the District Court, B&B argued that Hargis was precluded from contesting the likelihood of confusion because of the TTABs decision.  The District Court disagreed.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that preclusion was unwarranted because the TTAB and the court used different factors to evaluate likelihood of confusion, the TTAB placed too much emphasis on the appearance and sound of the two marks, and Hargis bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB while B&B bore it before the District Court.   
Held:So long as the other ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met, when the usages adjudicated by the TTAB are materially the same as those before a district court, issue preclusion should apply.  Pp.822.

            
        (a)An agency decision can ground issue preclusion.  The Courts cases establish that when Congress authorizes agencies to resolve disputes, courts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with the expectation that [issue preclusion] will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.  Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,

501 U.S. 104
.  Constitutional avoidance does not compel a different conclusion.  Pp.812.

            
         (b)Neither the Lanham Acts text nor its structure rebuts the presumption in favor of giving preclusive effect to TTAB decisions where the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met.  Astoria, 501 U.S., at 108.  This case is unlike Astoria.  There, where exhausting the administrative process was a prerequisite to suit in court, giving preclusive effect to the agencys determination in that very administrative process could have rendered the judicial suit strictly proforma. Id., at 111.  By contrast, registration involves a separate proceeding to decide separate rights.  Pp.1214.

            
        (c)There is no categorical reason why registration decisions can never meet the ordinary elements of issue preclusion.  That many registrations will not satisfy those ordinary elements does not mean that none will. Pp.1522.

            
        
            
        (1)Contrary to the Eighth Circuits conclusion, the same likelihood-of-confusion standard applies to both registration and infringement.  The factors that the TTAB and the Eighth Circuit use to assess likelihood of confusion are not fundamentally different, and, more important, the operative language of each statute is essentially the same.  

            
        Hargis claims that the standards are different, noting that the registration provision asks whether the marks resemble each other,

15 U.S.C. 1052(d), while the infringement provision is directed towards the use in commerce of the marks, 1114(1).  That the TTAB and a district court do not always consider the same usages, however, does not mean that the TTAB applies a different standard to the usages it does consider.  If a mark owner uses its mark in materially the same ways as the usages included in its registration application, then the TTAB is deciding the same likelihood-of-confusion issue as a district court in infringement litigation.  For a similar reason, the Eighth Circuit erred in holding that issue preclusion could not apply because the TTAB relied too heavily on appearance and sound.  Pp.1519.

            
        
            
        (2)The fact that the TTAB and district courts use different procedures suggests only that sometimes issue preclusion might be inappropriate, not that it always is.  Here, there is no categorical reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness, Montana v. United States, 

440 U.S. 147
, 164, n.11, of the agencys procedures.  In large part they are exactly the same as in federal court.  Also contrary to the Eighth Circuits conclusion, B&B, the party opposing registration, not Hargis, bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB, just as it did in the infringement suit.  Pp.1921.

            
        
            
        (3) Hargis is also wrong that the stakes for registration are always too low for issue preclusion in later infringement litigation.  When registration is opposed, there is good reason to think that both sides will take the matter seriously.  Congress creation of an elaborate registration scheme, with many important rights attached and backed up by plenary review, confirms that registration decisions can be weighty enough to ground issue preclusion.  Pp.2122.
716 F.3d 1020, reversed and remanded.

Omnicare, Inc., etal. v.Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 13435.Argued November 3, 2014Decided March 24, 2015
The Securities Act of 1933 requires that a company wishing to issue securities must first file a registration statement containing specified information about the issuing company and the securities offered.  See 15 U.S.C. 77g, 77aa.  The registration statement may also include other representations of fact or opinion.  To protect investors and promote compliance with these disclosure requirements, 11 of the Act creates two ways to hold issuers liable for a registration statements contents: A purchaser of securities may sue an issuer if the registration statement either contain[s] an untrue statement of a material fact or omit[s] to state a material fact ... necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.  77k(a).  In either case, the buyer need not prove that the issuer acted with any intent to deceive or defraud.  Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston,  459 U.S. 375 382.  
                                            Petitioner Omnicare, a pharmacy services company, filed a registration statement in connection with a public offering of common stock.  In addition to the required disclosures, the registration statement contained two statements expressing the companys opinion that it was in compliance with federal and state laws.  After the Federal Government filed suit against Omnicare for allegedly receiving kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers, respondents, pension funds that purchased Omnicare stock (hereinafter Funds), sued Omnicare under 11.  They claimed that Omnicares legal-compliance statements constituted untrue statement[s] of ... material fact and that Omnicare omitted to state [material] facts necessary to make those statements not misleading.
                                            The District Court granted Omnicares motion to dismiss.  Because the Funds had not alleged that Omnicares officers knew they were violating the law, the court found that the Funds had failed to state a 11 claim.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  Acknowledging that the statements at issue expressed opinions, the court held that no showing of subjective disbelief was required.  In the courts view, the Funds allegations that Omnicares legal-compliance opinions were objectively false sufficed to support their claim.  
Held:  
                      1.  A statement of opinion does not constitute an untrue statement of ... fact simply because the stated opinion ultimately proves incorrect.  The Sixth Circuits contrary holding wrongly conflates facts and opinions.  A statement of fact expresses certainty about a thing, whereas a statement of opinion conveys only an uncertain view as to that thing.  Section 11 incorporates that distinction in its first clause by exposing issuers to liability only for untrue statement[s] of ... fact.  77k(a) (emphasis added).  Because a statement of opinion admits the possibility of error, such a statement remains trueand thus is not an untrue statement of ... facteven if the opinion turns out to have been wrong.  
                      But opinion statements are not wholly immune from liability under 11s first clause.  Every such statement explicitly affirms one fact: that the speaker actually holds the stated belief.  A statement of opinion thus qualifies as an untrue statement of ... fact if that fact is untruei.e., if the opinion expressed was not sincerely held.  In addition, opinion statements can give rise to false-statement liability under 11 if they contain embedded statements of untrue facts.  Here, however, Omnicares sincerity is not contested and the statements at issue are pure opinion statements.  The Funds thus cannot establish liability under 11s first clause.  Pp.610.
                      2. If a registration statement omits material facts about the issuers inquiry into, or knowledge concerning, a statement of opinion, and if those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor, reading the statement fairly and in context, would take from the statement itself, then 11s omissions clause creates liability.  Pp.1020.
                                            (a) For purposes of 11s omissions clause, whether a statement is misleading is an objective inquiry that depends on a reasonable investors perspective.  Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,  426 U.S. 438 .  Omnicare goes too far by claiming that no reasonable person, in any context, can understand a statement of opinion to convey anything more than the speakers own mindset.  A reasonable investor may, depending on the circumstances, understand an opinion statement to convey facts about the speakers basis for holding that view.  Specifically, an issuers statement of opinion may fairly imply facts about the inquiry the issuer conducted or the knowledge it had.  And if the real facts are otherwise, but not provided, the opinion statement will mislead by omission.
                      An opinion statement, however, is not misleading simply because the issuer knows, but fails to disclose, some fact cutting the other way.  A reasonable investor does not expect that every fact known to an issuer supports its opinion statement.  Moreover, whether an omission makes an expression of opinion misleading always depends on context.  Reasonable investors understand opinion statements in light of the surrounding text, and 11 creates liability only for the omission of material facts that cannot be squared with a fair reading of the registration statement as a whole.  Omnicares arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  Pp.1019.
                                            (b) Because neither court below considered the Funds omissions theory under the right standard, this case is remanded for a determination of whether the Funds have stated a viable omissions claim.  On remand, the court must review the Funds complaint to determine whether it adequately alleges that Omnicare omitted from the registration statement some specific fact that would have been material to a reasonable investor.  If so, the court must decide whether the alleged omission rendered Omnicares opinion statements misleading in context.  Pp.1920.
719 F.3d 498, vacated and remanded.

PEREZ, SECRETARY OF LABOR, etal. v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION etal. 
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 131041.Argued December 1, 2014Decided March 9, 2015[1]
The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes the procedures federal administrative agencies use for rule making, defined as the process of formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.

5 U.S.C. 551(5).  The APA distinguishes between two types of rules: So-called legislative rules are issued through notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 553(b), (c), and have the force and effect of law, Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,

441 U.S. 281
303.  Interpretive rules, by contrast, are issued . . . to advise the public of the agencys construction of the statutes and rules which it administers, Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,

514 U.S. 87
, do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking, and do not have the force and effect of law, ibid.

            
        
            
        In 1999 and 2001, the Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative exemption to overtime pay requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  In 2004, the Department issued new regulations regarding the exemption.  Respondent Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) requested a new interpretation of the revised regulations as they applied to mortgage-loan officers, and in 2006, the Wage and Hour Division issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative exemption under the 2004 regulations.  In 2010, the Department again altered its interpretation of the administrative exemption.  Without notice or an opportunity for comment, the Department withdrew the 2006 opinion letter and issued an Administrators Interpretation concluding that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative exemption.

            
        
            
        MBA filed suit contending, as relevant here, that the Administrators Interpretation was procedurally invalid under the D. C. Circuits decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena L.P., 117 F. 3d 579.  The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine holds that an agency must use the APAs notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a previously adopted interpretation.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Department, but the D.C. Circuit applied Paralyzed Veterans and reversed.
Held:The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear text of the APAs rulemaking provisions and improperly imposes on agencies an obligation beyond the APAs maximum procedural requirements.  Pp.614.

            
        
            
        (a)The APAs categorical exemption of interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment process is fatal to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine.  The D.C. Circuits reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes of 1 and 4 of the Act.  Section 1 requires agencies to use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule, see

5 U.S.C. 551(5), but it does not say what procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking.  That is the purpose of 4.  And 4 specifically exempts interpretive rules from notice-and-comment requirements.  Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures to amend or repeal that rule.  Pp.78.

            
        
            
        (b)This straightforward reading of the APA harmonizes with longstanding principles of this Courts administrative law jurisprudence, which has consistently held that the APA sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for procedural correctness, FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,

556 U.S. 502
.  The APAs rulemaking provisions are no exception: 4 establishes the maximum procedural requirements that courts may impose upon agencies engaged in rulemaking.  Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

435 U.S. 519
.  By mandating notice-and-comment procedures when an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it enforces, Paralyzed Veterans creates a judge-made procedural right that is inconsistent with Congress standards.  Pp.89.

            
        
            
        (c)MBAs reasons for upholding the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine are unpersuasive.  Pp.914.

            
        
            
        
            
        (1)MBA asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation that significantly alters the agencys prior interpretation effectively amends the underlying regulation.  That assertion conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the words amend and interpret, and it is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law.  MBAs theory is particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, which applies only when an agency has previously adopted an interpretation of its regulation.  MBA fails to explain why its argument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to the agencys first interpretation.  Christensen v. Harris County,

529 U.S. 576
, and Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,

514 U.S. 87
, distinguished.  Pp.912.

            
        
            
        
            
        (2)MBA also contends that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine reinforces the APAs goal of procedural fairness.  But the APA already provides recourse to regulated entities from agency decisions that skirt notice-and-comment provisions by placing a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking, e.g., the arbitrary and capricious standard.  In addition, Congress may include safe-harbor provisions in legislation to shelter regulated entities from liability when they rely on previous agency interpretations.  See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. 259(a), (b)(1).  Pp.1213.

PEREZ, SECRETARY OF LABOR, etal. v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION etal. 
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 131041.Argued December 1, 2014Decided March 9, 2015[1]
The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes the procedures federal administrative agencies use for rule making, defined as the process of formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.

5 U.S.C. 551(5).  The APA distinguishes between two types of rules: So-called legislative rules are issued through notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 553(b), (c), and have the force and effect of law, Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,

441 U.S. 281
303.  Interpretive rules, by contrast, are issued . . . to advise the public of the agencys construction of the statutes and rules which it administers, Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,

514 U.S. 87
, do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking, and do not have the force and effect of law, ibid.

            
        
            
        In 1999 and 2001, the Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative exemption to overtime pay requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  In 2004, the Department issued new regulations regarding the exemption.  Respondent Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) requested a new interpretation of the revised regulations as they applied to mortgage-loan officers, and in 2006, the Wage and Hour Division issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative exemption under the 2004 regulations.  In 2010, the Department again altered its interpretation of the administrative exemption.  Without notice or an opportunity for comment, the Department withdrew the 2006 opinion letter and issued an Administrators Interpretation concluding that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative exemption.

            
        
            
        MBA filed suit contending, as relevant here, that the Administrators Interpretation was procedurally invalid under the D. C. Circuits decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena L.P., 117 F. 3d 579.  The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine holds that an agency must use the APAs notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a previously adopted interpretation.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Department, but the D.C. Circuit applied Paralyzed Veterans and reversed.
Held:The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear text of the APAs rulemaking provisions and improperly imposes on agencies an obligation beyond the APAs maximum procedural requirements.  Pp.614.

            
        
            
        (a)The APAs categorical exemption of interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment process is fatal to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine.  The D.C. Circuits reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes of 1 and 4 of the Act.  Section 1 requires agencies to use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule, see

5 U.S.C. 551(5), but it does not say what procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking.  That is the purpose of 4.  And 4 specifically exempts interpretive rules from notice-and-comment requirements.  Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures to amend or repeal that rule.  Pp.78.

            
        
            
        (b)This straightforward reading of the APA harmonizes with longstanding principles of this Courts administrative law jurisprudence, which has consistently held that the APA sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for procedural correctness, FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,

556 U.S. 502
.  The APAs rulemaking provisions are no exception: 4 establishes the maximum procedural requirements that courts may impose upon agencies engaged in rulemaking.  Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

435 U.S. 519
.  By mandating notice-and-comment procedures when an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it enforces, Paralyzed Veterans creates a judge-made procedural right that is inconsistent with Congress standards.  Pp.89.

            
        
            
        (c)MBAs reasons for upholding the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine are unpersuasive.  Pp.914.

            
        
            
        
            
        (1)MBA asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation that significantly alters the agencys prior interpretation effectively amends the underlying regulation.  That assertion conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the words amend and interpret, and it is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law.  MBAs theory is particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, which applies only when an agency has previously adopted an interpretation of its regulation.  MBA fails to explain why its argument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to the agencys first interpretation.  Christensen v. Harris County,

529 U.S. 576
, and Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,

514 U.S. 87
, distinguished.  Pp.912.

            
        
            
        
            
        (2)MBA also contends that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine reinforces the APAs goal of procedural fairness.  But the APA already provides recourse to regulated entities from agency decisions that skirt notice-and-comment provisions by placing a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking, e.g., the arbitrary and capricious standard.  In addition, Congress may include safe-harbor provisions in legislation to shelter regulated entities from liability when they rely on previous agency interpretations.  See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. 259(a), (b)(1).  Pp.1213.

            
        
            
        
            
        (3)MBA has waived its argument that the 2010 Administrators Interpretation should be classified as a legislative rule.  From the beginning, this suit has been litigated on the understanding that the Administrators Interpretation is an interpretive rule.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed this argument below, and MBA did not raise it here in opposing certiorari.  P. 14.
720 F. 3d 966, reversed.

            
        Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, JJ., joined, and in which Alito, J., joined except for Part IIIB.

Syllabus
Department of Transportation et al. v. Association of American Railroads
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 13   1080.   Argued December 8, 2014   Decided March 9, 2015
In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak).  Congress has given Amtrak priority to use track systems owned by the freight railroads for passenger rail travel, at rates agreed to by the parties or, in case of a dispute, set by the Surface Transportation Board.  And in 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue    metrics and standards    addressing the performance and scheduling of passenger railroad services, see   207(a),  122Stat. 4907, including Amtrak   s on-time performance and train delays caused by host railroads.  Respondent, the Association of American Railroads, sued petitioners   the Department of Transportation, the FRA, and two officials   claiming that the metrics and standards must be invalidated because it is unconstitutional for Congress to allow and direct a private entity like Amtrak to exercise joint authority in their issuance.  Its argument rested on the   Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers.  The District Court rejected respondent   s claims, but the District of Columbia Circuit reversed as to the separation of powers claim, reasoning in central part that Amtrak is a private corporation and thus cannot constitutionally be granted regulatory power under   207.  
Held:  For purposes of determining the validity of the metrics and standards, Amtrak is a governmental entity.  Pp.  6   12.
                      (a)  In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals relied on the statutory command that Amtrak    is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government,     49 U.  S.  C.   24301(a)(3), and the pronouncement that Amtrak    shall be operated and managed as a for profit corporation,      24301(a)(2).  But congressional pronouncements are not dispositive of Amtrak   s status as a governmental entity for purposes of separation of powers analysis under the Constitution, and an independent inquiry reveals the Court of Appeals    premise that Amtrak is a private entity was flawed.  As Amtrak   s ownership and corporate structure show, the political branches control most of Amtrak   s stock and its Board of Directors, most of whom are appointed by the President,   24302(a)(1), confirmed by the Senate, ibid., and understood by the Executive Branch to be removable by the President at will.  The political branches also exercise substantial, statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak   s priorities and operations.  See, e.g.,   24315.  Also of significance, Amtrak is required by statute to pursue broad public objectives, see, e.g.,     24101(b), 24307(a); certain aspects of Amtrak   s day-to-day operations are mandated by Congress, see, e.g.,     24101(c)(6), 24902(b); and Amtrak has been dependent on federal financial support during every year of its existence.  Given the combination of these unique features and Amtrak   s significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is not an autonomous private enterprise.  Amtrak was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the Government   s benefit.  Thus, in jointly issuing the metrics and standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a governmental entity for separation of powers purposes.  And that exercise of governmental power must be consistent with the Constitution, including those provisions relating to the separation of powers.  Pp.  6   10.
                      (b)  Respondent   s reliance on congressional statements about Amtrak   s status is misplaced.  Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.,  513 U.  S. 374 , teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak   s status as a federal actor or instrumentality under the Constitution, the practical reality of federal control and supervision prevails over Congress    disclaimer of Amtrak   s governmental status.  Treating Amtrak as governmental for these purposes, moreover, is not an unbridled grant of authority to an unaccountable actor, for the political branches created Amtrak, control its Board, define its mission, specify many of its day-to-day operations, have imposed substantial transparency and accountability mechanisms, and, for all practical purposes, set and supervise its annual budget.  Pp.  10   11. 
                      (c)  The Court of Appeals may address in the first instance any properly preserved issues respecting the lawfulness of the metrics and standards that may remain in this case, including questions implicating the Constitution   s structural separation of powers and the Appointments Clause.  Pp.  11   12.
721 F.  3d 666, vacated and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
Alabama Department of Revenue et al. v.  CSX Transportation, Inc.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 13   553.   Argued December 9, 2014   Decided March 4, 2015
Alabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts from those taxes trucking transport companies (motor carriers) and companies that transport goods interstate through navigable waters (water carriers), both railroad competitors.  Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax on diesel, but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise tax.  Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State   s asymmetrical tax treatment    discriminates against a rail carrier    in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4   R Act,  49 U.  S.  C.   11501(b)(4).  This Court held that a tax    discriminates    under subsection (b)(4) when it treats    groups [that] are similarly situated    differently without sufficient    justification for the difference in treatment,    CSX Transp. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue,  562 U.  S. 277  (CSX I).  On remand, the District Court rejected CSX   s claim.  Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors, but rejected Alabama   s argument that imposing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justified imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.
Held:  
                      1.  The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX   s competitors are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.
                      All general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.  Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word    discrimination    suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.  Context confirms this reading.  The 4   R Act is an    asymmetrical statute.     CSX I, supra, at 296.  In subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3)   which specify prohibitions directed toward property taxes   the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.  But subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be determined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.  Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.  Because subsection (b)(4) requires a showing of discrimination, however, the comparison class must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.
                      Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if    similarly situated    were given the same narrow construction the concept has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be permissible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier, despite their seemingly similar lines of business.  The category of    similarly situated    (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other subsections.  But it also can include a railroad   s competitors.  Discrimination in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of    discrimination    and frustrates the 4   R Act   s purpose of    restor[ing]  the financial stability of the [Nation   s] railway system    while    foster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,     90Stat. 33.  Contrary to Alabama   s argument, normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation to    commercial and industrial    in the first three provisions, and its absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.  Alabama   s additional arguments are also unavailing.  Pp.  4   8.
                      2.  The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax.  It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other.  The Court   s negative Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.  Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query,  286 U.  S. 472    480.  Similarly, an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory.  CSX   s counterarguments are rejected.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit is to consider whether Alabama   s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama   s sales tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-tax exemption.  Although the State cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its water carrier exemption, the court should also examine whether any of the State   s alternative rationales justify that exemption.  Pp.  8   10.
720 F.  3d 863, reversed and remanded.

Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State   s asymmetrical tax treatment    discriminates against a rail carrier    in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4   R Act,  49 U.  S.  C.   11501(b)(4).  This Court held that a tax    discriminates    under subsection (b)(4) when it treats    groups [that] are similarly situated    differently without sufficient    justification for the difference in treatment,    CSX Transp. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue,  562 U.  S. 277  (CSX I).  On remand, the District Court rejected CSX   s claim.  Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors, but rejected Alabama   s argument that imposing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justified imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.
Held:  
                      1.  The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX   s competitors are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.
                      All general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.  Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word    discrimination    suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.  Context confirms this reading.  The 4   R Act is an    asymmetrical statute.     CSX I, supra, at 296.  In subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3)   which specify prohibitions directed toward property taxes   the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.  But subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be determined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.  Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.  Because subsection (b)(4) requires a showing of discrimination, however, the comparison class must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.
                      Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if    similarly situated    were given the same narrow construction the concept has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be permissible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier, despite their seemingly similar lines of business.  The category of    similarly situated    (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other subsections.  But it also can include a railroad   s competitors.  Discrimination in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of    discrimination    and frustrates the 4   R Act   s purpose of    restor[ing]  the financial stability of the [Nation   s] railway system    while    foster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,     90Stat. 33.  Contrary to Alabama   s argument, normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation to    commercial and industrial    in the first three provisions, and its absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.  Alabama   s additional arguments are also unavailing.  Pp.  4   8.
                      2.  The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax.  It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other.  The Court   s negative Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.  Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query,  286 U.  S. 472    480.  Similarly, an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory.  CSX   s counterarguments are rejected.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit is to consider whether Alabama   s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama   s sales tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-tax exemption.  Although the State cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its water carrier exemption, the court should also examine whether any of the State   s alternative rationales justify that exemption.  Pp.  8   10.

			Alabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads purchasing or consuming diesel fuel, but exempts their competitors: trucking companies and companies that transport goods interstate through navigable waters. Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax on diesel, but water carriers pay neither sales tax nor excise tax. CSX, an interstate rail carrier, alleged discrimination against a rail carrier under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act, 49 U.S.C. 11501(b)(4). The Supreme Court held that a tax discriminates when it treats groups [that] are similarly situated differently without sufficient justification.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors, but rejected Alabamas argument that the fuel-excise tax on motor carriers justified the sales tax on rail carriers. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded. CSXs competitors are an appropriate comparison class; the class need not consist of general commercial and industrial taxpayers. The Acts subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3), addressing property taxes, limits the comparison class to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is based on the claimed theory of discrimination. When a railroad alleges discrimination compared to transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class. The comparison class must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant. Discrimination in favor of competitors frustrates the Acts purpose of restoring railways financial stability while fostering competition among all carriers. The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider Alabamas proposed justification. An alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification. On remand, the court is to consider whether Alabamas fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of sales tax on diesel fuel and whether any alternative rationales justify the water carrier exemption.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, Executive Director, Colorado Department of Revenue
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 13 1032. Argued December 8, 2014 Decided March 3, 2015
Colorado requires residents who purchase tangible personal property from a retailer that does not collect sales or use taxes to file a return and remit those taxes directly to the State Department of Revenue. To improve compliance, Colorado enacted legislation requiring noncollecting retailers to notify any Colorado customer of the State s sales and use tax requirement and to report tax-related information to those customers and the Colorado Department of Revenue.
Petitioner, a trade association of retailers, many of which sell to Colorado residents but do not collect taxes, sued respondent, the Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue, in Federal District Court, alleging that Colorado s law violates the United States and Colorado Constitutions. The District Court granted petitioner partial summary judgment and permanently enjoined enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. That court held that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which provides that federal district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State, 28 U. S. C.    1341, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction over the suit.
Held: Petitioner s suit is not barred by the TIA. Pp. 4-13.
(a) The relief sought by petitioner would not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of Colorado s sales and use taxes. Pp. 4-12.
(1) The terms assessment, levy, and collection do not encompass Colorado s enforcement of its notice and reporting requirements. These terms, read in light of the Federal Tax Code, refer to discrete phases of the taxation process that do not include informational notices or private reports of information relevant to tax liability. Information gathering has long been treated as a phase of tax administration that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection. See, e.g., 26 U. S. C.    6041 et seq.  Respondent portrays the notice and reporting requirements as part of the State s assessment and collection process, but the State s assessment and collection procedures are triggered after the State has received the returns and made the deficiency determinations that the notice and reporting requirements are meant to facilitate. Enforcement of the requirements may improve the State s ability to assess and ultimately collect its sales and use taxes, but the TIA is not keyed to all such activities. Such a rule would be inconsistent with the statute s text and this Court s rule favoring clear boundaries in the interpretation of jurisdictional statutes. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77. Pp. 5-9.
(2) Petitioner s suit cannot be understood to restrain the assessment, levy or collection of Colorado s sales and use taxes merely because it may inhibit those activities. While the word restrain can be defined as broadly as the Tenth Circuit defined it, it also has a narrower meaning used in equity, which captures only those orders that stop acts of assessment, levy, or collection. The context in which the TIA uses the word restrain resolves this ambiguity in favor of this narrower meaning. First, the verbs accompanying restrain enjoin and suspend are terms of art in equity and refer to different equitable remedies that restrict or stop official action, strongly suggesting that restrain does the same. Additionally, restrain acts on assessment, levy, and collection, a carefully selected list of technical terms. The Tenth Circuit s broad meaning would defeat the precision of that list and render many of those terms surplusage. Assigning restrain its meaning in equity is also consistent with this Court s recognition that the TIA has its roots in equity practice, Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S. 68, and with the principle that [j]urisdictional rules should be clear, Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308 (Thomas, J., concurring). Pp. 10-12.
(b) The Court takes no position on whether a suit such as this might be barred under the comity doctrine, which counsels lower federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling within their jurisdiction, Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413. The Court leaves it to the Tenth Circuit to decide on remand whether the comity argument remains available to Colorado. P. 13.

North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 13   534.   Argued October 14, 2014   Decided February 25, 2015
North Carolina's Dental Practice Act (Act) provides that the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is    the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.     The Board   s principal duty is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system for dentists; and six of its eight members must be licensed, practicing dentists. 
                                            The Act does not specify that teeth whitening is    the practice of dentistry.     Nonetheless, after dentists complained to the Board that nondentists were charging lower prices for such services than dentists did, the Board issued at least 47 official cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manufacturers, often warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime.  This and other related Board actions led nondentists to cease offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.
                                            The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative complaint, alleging that the Board   s concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the Board   s motion to dismiss on the ground of state-action immunity.  The FTC sustained that ruling, reasoning that even if the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition, the Board must be actively supervised by the State to claim immunity, which it was not.  After a hearing on the merits, the ALJ determined that the Board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law.  The FTC again sustained the ALJ, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects.  
Held:   Because a controlling number of the Board   s decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the Board regulates, the Board can invoke state-action antitrust immunity only if it was subject to active supervision by the State, and here that requirement is not met.  Pp.  5   18.
                      (a)  Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the Nation   s free market structures.  However, requiring States to conform to the mandates of the Sherman Act at the expense of other values a State may deem fundamental would impose an impermissible burden on the States    power to regulate.  Therefore, beginning with Parker v. Brown,  317 U.  S. 341 , this Court interpreted the antitrust laws to confer immunity on the anticompetitive conduct of States acting in their sovereign capacity.  Pp.  5   6.
                      (b)  The Board   s actions are not cloaked with Parker immunity.  A nonsovereign actor controlled by active market participants   such as the Board   enjoys Parker immunity only if         the challenged restraint .  .  . [is] clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,    and .  .  .    the policy .  .  . [is] actively supervised by the State.          FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U.  S. ___, ___ (quoting California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,   445 U.  S. 97 ).  Here, the Board did not receive active supervision of its anticompetitive conduct.  Pp.  6   17.
                                            (1)  An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless its actions are an exercise of the State   s sovereign power.  See Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,  499 U.  S. 365 .  Thus, where a State delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the Sherman Act confers immunity only if the State accepts political accountability for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls.  Limits on state-action immunity are most essential when a State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market participants, for dual allegiances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy.  Accordingly, Parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors, especially those authorized by the State to regulate their own profession, result from procedures that suffice to make it the State   s own.  Midcal   s two-part test provides a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether an anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy of a State.  The first requirement   clear articulation   rarely will achieve that goal by itself, for entities purporting to act under state authority might diverge from the State   s considered definition of the public good and engage in private self-dealing.  The second Midcal requirement   active supervision   seeks to avoid this harm by requiring the State to review and approve interstitial policies made by the entity claiming immunity.  Pp.  6   10.
                                            (2)  There are instances in which an actor can be excused from Midcal   s active supervision requirement.  Municipalities, which are electorally accountable, have general regulatory powers, and have no private price-fixing agenda, are subject exclusively to the clear articulation requirement.  See Hallie v. Eau Claire,  471 U.  S. 34 .  That Hallie excused municipalities from Midcal   s supervision rule for these reasons, however, all but confirms the rule   s applicability to actors controlled by active market participants.  Further, in light of Omni   s holding that an otherwise immune entity will not lose immunity based on ad  hoc and ex  post questioning of its motives for making particular decisions, 499 U.  S., at 374, it is all the more necessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the first place, see FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.,  504 U.  S. 621 , and Phoebe Putney, supra, at ___.  The clear lesson of precedent is that Midcal   s active supervision test is an essential prerequisite of Parker immunity for any nonsovereign entity   public or private   controlled by active market participants.  Pp.  10   12.
                                            (3)  The Board   s argument that entities designated by the States as agencies are exempt from Midcal   s second requirement cannot be reconciled with the Court   s repeated conclusion that the need for supervision turns not on the formal designation given by States to regulators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue private interests in restraining trade.  State agencies controlled by active market participants pose the very risk of self-dealing Midcal   s supervision requirement was created to address.  See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,  421 U.  S. 773 .  This conclusion does not question the good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of the structural risk of market participants    confusing their own interests with the State   s policy goals.  While Hallie stated    it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required    for agencies, 471 U.  S., at 46, n.  10, the entity there was more like prototypical state agencies, not specialized boards dominated by active market participants.  The latter are similar to private trade associations vested by States with regulatory authority, which must satisfy Midcal   s active supervision standard.  445 U.  S., at 105   106.  The similarities between agencies controlled by active market participants and such associations are not eliminated simply because the former are given a formal designation by the State, vested with a measure of government power, and required to follow some procedural rules.  See Hallie, supra, at 39.  When a State empowers a group of active market participants to decide who can participate in its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest.  Thus, the Court holds today that a state board on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy Midcal   s active supervision requirement in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.  Pp.  12   14.
                                            (4)  The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that regulate their own occupation.  But this holding is not inconsistent with the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the State.  Further, this case does not offer occasion to address the question whether agency officials, including board members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy immunity from damages liability.  Of course, States may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation, and they can also ensure Parker immunity is available by adopting clear policies to displace competition and providing active supervision.  Arguments against the wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking Parker immunity must be rejected, see Patrick v. Burget,  486 U.  S. 94    106, particularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market participants may pose to the free market.  Pp.  14   16.  
                                            (5)  The Board does not contend in this Court that its anticompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the State or that it should receive Parker immunity on that basis.  The Act delegates control over the practice of dentistry to the Board, but says nothing about teeth whitening.  In acting to expel the dentists    competitors from the market, the Board relied on cease-and-desist letters threatening criminal liability, instead of other powers at its disposal that would have invoked oversight by a politically accountable official.  Whether or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, there is no evidence of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with the Board   s actions against the nondentists.  P.  17.
                      (c)  Here, where there are no specific supervisory systems to be reviewed, it suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexible and context-dependent.  The question is whether the State   s review mechanisms provide    realistic assurance    that a nonsovereign actor   s anticompetitive conduct    promotes state policy, rather than merely the party   s individual interests.     Patrick, 486 U.  S., 100   101.  The Court has identified only a few constant requirements of active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision, see id., at 102   103; the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord with state policy, see ibid.; and the    mere potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a decision by the State,    Ticor, supra, at 638.  Further, the state supervisor may not itself be an active market participant.  In general, however, the adequacy of supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstances of a case.  Pp.  17   18.

                                            The Act does not specify that teeth whitening is    the practice of dentistry.     Nonetheless, after dentists complained to the Board that nondentists were charging lower prices for such services than dentists did, the Board issued at least 47 official cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manufacturers, often warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime.  This and other related Board actions led nondentists to cease offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.
                                            The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative complaint, alleging that the Board   s concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the Board   s motion to dismiss on the ground of state-action immunity.  The FTC sustained that ruling, reasoning that even if the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition, the Board must be actively supervised by the State to claim immunity, which it was not.  After a hearing on the merits, the ALJ determined that the Board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law.  The FTC again sustained the ALJ, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects.  
Held:   Because a controlling number of the Board   s decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the Board regulates, the Board can invoke state-action antitrust immunity only if it was subject to active supervision by the State, and here that requirement is not met.  Pp.  5   18.
                      (a)  Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the Nation   s free market structures.  However, requiring States to conform to the mandates of the Sherman Act at the expense of other values a State may deem fundamental would impose an impermissible burden on the States    power to regulate.  Therefore, beginning with Parker v. Brown,  317 U.  S. 341 , this Court interpreted the antitrust laws to confer immunity on the anticompetitive conduct of States acting in their sovereign capacity.  Pp.  5   6.
                      (b)  The Board   s actions are not cloaked with Parker immunity.  A nonsovereign actor controlled by active market participants   such as the Board   enjoys Parker immunity only if         the challenged restraint .  .  . [is] clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,    and .  .  .    the policy .  .  . [is] actively supervised by the State.          FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U.  S. ___, ___ (quoting California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,   445 U.  S. 97 ).  Here, the Board did not receive active supervision of its anticompetitive conduct.  Pp.  6   17.
                                            (1)  An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless its actions are an exercise of the State   s sovereign power.  See Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,  499 U.  S. 365 .  Thus, where a State delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the Sherman Act confers immunity only if the State accepts political accountability for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls.  Limits on state-action immunity are most essential when a State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market participants, for dual allegiances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy.  Accordingly, Parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors, especially those authorized by the State to regulate their own profession, result from procedures that suffice to make it the State   s own.  Midcal   s two-part test provides a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether an anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy of a State.  The first requirement   clear articulation   rarely will achieve that goal by itself, for entities purporting to act under state authority might diverge from the State   s considered definition of the public good and engage in private self-dealing.  The second Midcal requirement   active supervision   seeks to avoid this harm by requiring the State to review and approve interstitial policies made by the entity claiming immunity.  Pp.  6   10.
                                            (2)  There are instances in which an actor can be excused from Midcal   s active supervision requirement.  Municipalities, which are electorally accountable, have general regulatory powers, and have no private price-fixing agenda, are subject exclusively to the clear articulation requirement.  See Hallie v. Eau Claire,  471 U.  S. 34 .  That Hallie excused municipalities from Midcal   s supervision rule for these reasons, however, all but confirms the rule   s applicability to actors controlled by active market participants.  Further, in light of Omni   s holding that an otherwise immune entity will not lose immunity based on ad  hoc and ex  post questioning of its motives for making particular decisions, 499 U.  S., at 374, it is all the more necessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the first place, see FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.,  504 U.  S. 621 , and Phoebe Putney, supra, at ___.  The clear lesson of precedent is that Midcal   s active supervision test is an essential prerequisite of Parker immunity for any nonsovereign entity   public or private   controlled by active market participants.  Pp.  10   12.
                                            (3)  The Board   s argument that entities designated by the States as agencies are exempt from Midcal   s second requirement cannot be reconciled with the Court   s repeated conclusion that the need for supervision turns not on the formal designation given by States to regulators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue private interests in restraining trade.  State agencies controlled by active market participants pose the very risk of self-dealing Midcal   s supervision requirement was created to address.  See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,  421 U.  S. 773 .  This conclusion does not question the good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of the structural risk of market participants    confusing their own interests with the State   s policy goals.  While Hallie stated    it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required    for agencies, 471 U.  S., at 46, n.  10, the entity there was more like prototypical state agencies, not specialized boards dominated by active market participants.  The latter are similar to private trade associations vested by States with regulatory authority, which must satisfy Midcal   s active supervision standard.  445 U.  S., at 105   106.  The similarities between agencies controlled by active market participants and such associations are not eliminated simply because the former are given a formal designation by the State, vested with a measure of government power, and required to follow some procedural rules.  See Hallie, supra, at 39.  When a State empowers a group of active market participants to decide who can participate in its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest.  Thus, the Court holds today that a state board on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy Midcal   s active supervision requirement in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.  Pp.  12   14.
                                            (4)  The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that regulate their own occupation.  But this holding is not inconsistent with the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the State.  Further, this case does not offer occasion to address the question whether agency officials, including board members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy immunity from damages liability.  Of course, States may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation, and they can also ensure Parker immunity is available by adopting clear policies to displace competition and providing active supervision.  Arguments against the wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking Parker immunity must be rejected, see Patrick v. Burget,  486 U.  S. 94    106, particularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market participants may pose to the free market.  Pp.  14   16.  
                                            (5)  The Board does not contend in this Court that its anticompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the State or that it should receive Parker immunity on that basis.  The Act delegates control over the practice of dentistry to the Board, but says nothing about teeth whitening.  In acting to expel the dentists    competitors from the market, the Board relied on cease-and-desist letters threatening criminal liability, instead of other powers at its disposal that would have invoked oversight by a politically accountable official.  Whether or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, there is no evidence of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with the Board   s actions against the nondentists.  P.  17.
                      (c)  Here, where there are no specific supervisory systems to be reviewed, it suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexible and context-dependent.  The question is whether the State   s review mechanisms provide    realistic assurance    that a nonsovereign actor   s anticompetitive conduct    promotes state policy, rather than merely the party   s individual interests.     Patrick, 486 U.  S., 100   101.  The Court has identified only a few constant requirements of active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision, see id., at 102   103; the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord with state policy, see ibid.; and the    mere potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a decision by the State,    Ticor, supra, at 638.  Further, the state supervisor may not itself be an active market participant.  In general, however, the adequacy of supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstances of a case.  Pp.  17   18.

			North Carolinas Dental Practice Act does not specify that teeth whitening is the practice of dentistry. After dentists complained, the Board of Dental Examiners issued cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manufacturers, warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime. The FTC filed an administrative complaint, alleging that the Boards concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An ALJ rejected a claim of state-action immunity and ruled against the Board. The FTC, the Fourth Circuit, and the Supreme Court affirmed. Because a controlling number of the Boards decision-makers are active market participants in the occupation being regulated, the Board could invoke immunity only if the challenged restraint was clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy, actively supervised by the state. That requirement was not met. The need for supervision turns not on the formal designation given by states to regulators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue private interests in restraining trade. States may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation, and can ensure immunity by adopting clear policies to displace competition and providing active supervision. Regardless of whether the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, there is no evidence of any decision by the state to initiate or concur with the Boards actions against the nondentists.

Yates v. United States
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 13   7451.   Argued November 5, 2014   Decided February 25, 2015
While conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship   s catch contained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation regulations.  The officer instructed the ship   s captain, petitioner Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the catch until the ship returned to port.  After the officer departed, Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish overboard.  For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of  18 U.  S.  C.   1519.  That section provides that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he    knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence    a federal investigation.  At trial, Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the   1519 charge.  Pointing to   1519   s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued that   1519   s reference to    tangible object    subsumes objects used to store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish.  The District Court denied Yates   s motion, and a jury found him guilty of violating   1519.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, concluding that   1519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the dictionary definition of    tangible object.   
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
733 F.  3d 1059, reversed and remanded.
                      Justice Ginsburg, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded that a    tangible object    within   1519   s compass is one used to record or preserve information.  Pp.  6   20.
                      (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words    tangible    and    object    bear consideration in determining the meaning of    tangible object    in   1519, they are not dispositive.  Whether a statutory term is unambiguous    is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.     Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,  519 U.  S. 337 .  Identical language may convey varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute.  See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.  S. ___, ___.  Pp.  7   10.
                      (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of    tangible object.     Though not commanding,   1519   s heading      Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy      conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.  
                      Section 1519   s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals that   1519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evidence.  Congress placed   1519 at the end of Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.  
                      The contemporaneous passage of   1512(c)(1), which prohibits a person from    alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a record, document, or other object .  .  . with the intent to impair the object   s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,    is also instructive.  The Government argues that   1512(c)(1)   s reference to    other object    includes any and every physical object.  But if   1519   s reference to    tangible object    already included all physical objects, as the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact   1512(c)(1).  Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.  See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.  S. ___, ___.
                      The words immediately surrounding    tangible object    in   1519      falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document      also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.  Applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,    tangible object,    as the last in a list of terms that begins    any record [or] document,    is appropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects used to record or preserve information.  This moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions   1519 proscribes; the verbs    falsif[y]    and    mak[e] a false entry in    typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives.  See Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,  513 U.  S. 561 .    
                      Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and   1519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of    tangible object.   
                      Furthermore, the meaning of    record, document, or thing    in a provision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to    record, document, or tangible object    in   1519.  There are significant differences between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense created by   1519.  Pp.  10   18.
                      (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of    tangible object    in   1519, it would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity.  Pp.  18   19.
                      Justice Alito concluded that traditional rules of statutory construction confirm that Yates has the better argument.  Title  18 U.  S.  C.   1519   s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined, tip the case in favor of Yates.  Applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns      any record, document, or tangible object      the term    tangible object    should refer to something similar to records or documents.  And while many of   1519   s verbs      alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in      could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders or sand dunes, the term    makes a false entry in    makes no sense outside of filekeeping.  Finally,   1519   s title      Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy      also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.  Pp.  1   4.

			While inspecting a commercial fishing vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the catch contained undersized red grouper, in violation of conservation regulations, and instructed the captain, Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the catch until the ship returned to port. After the officer departed, Yates told the crew to throw the undersized fish overboard. Yates was convicted of destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation under 18 U. S. C. 519, which applies when a person knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence a federal investigation. Yates argued that section 1519 originated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to protect investors, and that its reference to tangible object includes objects used to store information, such as computer hard drives. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that tangible object refers to one used to record or preserve information. Section 1519s position within Title 18, Chapter 73 and its title, Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy, signal that it was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evidence. The words immediately surrounding tangible object, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document, also indicate the contextual meaning of that term. Even if traditional tools of statutory construction leave any doubt about the meaning of the term, it would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity.

KANSAS v. NEBRASKA etal.
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 126, Orig.Argued October 14, 2014Decided February 24, 2015
In 1943, Congress approved the Republican River Compact, an agreement between Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado to apportion the virgin water originating in the Republican River Basin.

57Stat.
87.  In 1998, Kansas filed an original action in this Court contending that Nebraskas increased groundwater pumping was subject to regulation by the Compact to the extent that it depleted stream flow in the Basin.  This Court agreed.  Ensuing negotiations resulted in the 2002 Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), which established mechanisms to accurately measure water and promote compliance with the Compact.  The Settlement identified the Accounting Procedures, a technical appendix, as the tool by which the States would measure stream flow depletion, and thus consumption, due to groundwater pumping.  The Settlement also reaffirmed that imported waterthat is, water brought into the Basin by human activitywould not count toward a States consumption.  Again, the Accounting Procedures were to measure, so as to exclude, that water flow.

            
        
            
        In 2007, following the first post-Settlement accounting period, Kansas petitioned this Court for monetary and injunctive relief, claiming that Nebraska had substantially exceeded its water allocation.  Nebraska responded that the Accounting Procedures improperly charged the State for using imported water and requested that the Accounting Procedures be modified accordingly.  The Court appointed a Special Master.  His report concludes that Nebraska knowingly failed to comply with the Compact, recommends that Nebraska disgorge a portion of its gains in addition to paying damages for Kansass loss, and recommends denying Kansass request for an injunction.  In addition, the report recommends reforming the Accounting Procedures.  The parties have filed exceptions.
Held:

            
        1.Proceedings under this Courts original jurisdiction are basically equitable in nature, Ohio v. Kentucky,

410 U.S. 641
, and in exercising that jurisdiction over a controversy between two States, the Court may mould the process [to] best promote the purposes of justice. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98.  Where the States have negotiated a Compact, the Court is confined to declaring rights under and enforcing its terms.  But within those bounds, the Court may invoke equitable principles to devise fair  solution[s] to compact violations.  Texas v. New Mexico,

482 U.S. 124
.  And where Congress has approved the Compact so that it counts as federal law, see Cuyler v. Adams,

449 U.S. 433
, the Court may, consistent with the Compacts express terms, exercise its full authority to remedy violations of, and promote compliance with, the agreement, see Porter v. Warner Holding Co.,

328 U.S. 395
.  Pp.69.

            
        2.The Special Masters determination that Nebraska knowingly failed to comply with its Settlement obligations, his recommendation that Nebraska pay Kansas an additional $1.8 million in disgorgement, and his recommendation that Kansass request for injunctive relief be denied are all adopted.  The parties exceptions are overruled.  Pp.920.

            
        
            
        (a)Nebraska knowingly failed to comply with its Settlement obligations, and disgorgement is an appropriate remedy for Nebraskas breach.  Pp.1017.

            
        
            
        
            
        (i) As the Special Master found, Nebraska failed to put adequate compliance mechanisms in place in the face of a known substantial risk that it would violate Kansass rights.  Nebraskas argument that it could not have anticipated unprecedented drought conditions fails, because its efforts to comply would have been inadequate absent the luckiest of circumstances.  Nor can the State find refuge in the Compacts retrospective compliance calculation methods, because it had been warned each year leading up to the final compliance check that it had exceeded its allotment.  The Court therefore agrees with the Master that Nebraska knowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk of receiving less water than it was entitled to under the Compact.  Report 130.  In other words, Nebraska recklessly gambled with Kansass rights.  Pp.1014.

            
        
            
        
            
        (ii)Because Nebraskas benefit from its breach exceeded the $3.7 million loss Kansas suffered, the Special Master recommended that Nebraska disgorge part of its additional gain. Nebraska contends that disgorgement is improper because it did not act deliberately, which it argues is required for disgorgement in a private contract suit.  But disgorgement is appropriate where one State has recklessly gambled with another States rights to a scarce natural resource. This Court has said that awarding actual damages in a compact case may be inadequate to deter an upstream State from ignoring its obligations where it is advantageous to do so. Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S., at 132. Here, Nebraska took full advantage of its favorable geographic position. And because of the higher value of water on Nebraskas farmland than on Kansass, Nebraska could take Kansass water, pay damages, and still benefit. This Courts remedial authority extends to providing a remedy capable of stabilizing the Compact and deterring future breaches, and a disgorgement award appropriately does so here. Pp.1417.

            
        
            
        (b)Contrary to Kansass contentions, the Masters partial disgorgement award is sufficient to achieve those goals.  The flexibility inherent in equitable remedies, Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. ___, ___, allows the Court to order partial disgorgement if appropriate to the facts of the particular case, cf. Kansas v. Colorado,

533 U.S. 1
.  The Special Master properly took into account Nebraskas incentives, past behavior, and especially its more recent successful compliance efforts to determine that a small disgorgement award suffices.  For related reasons, Kansas has failed to demonstrate a cognizable danger of recurrent violation necessary to obtain an injunction.  United States v. W. T. Grant Co.,

345 U.S. 629
.  Pp.1720.

            
        3.The Special Masters recommendation to amend the Accounting Procedures so that they no longer charge Nebraska for imported water is adopted, and Kansass exception is overruled.  As the Special Master found, in dry conditions, the Accounting Procedures improperly treat Nebraskas use of imported water as if it were use of Basin water.  Nothing suggests that anyone seriously thought the Accounting Procedures would systematically err in this way.  Rather, the Procedures designers assumed that they had succeeded in their goal to implement a strict demarcation between virgin and imported water.

            
        Kansas argues that in spite of these failures, the States must be held to the bargain they struck.  That is the ordinary rule.  But two special considerations warrant conforming the Accounting Procedures to the Compact and the Settlement.  First, the remedy is necessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting the States intended apportionment of interstate waters, as reflected in those documents.  Doing so is consistent with past instances where this Court opted to modify a technical agreement to correct material errors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting States intended apportionment.  Second, this remedy is required to avert an outright breach of the Compactand so a violation of federal law.  As written, the Accounting Procedures go beyond the Compacts boundaries and deprive Nebraska of its compact rights.  The Masters proposed 5-run formula solves this problem by excluding imported water from the calculation of each States consumption.  Given Kansass failure despite ample opportunity to devise another solution or to demonstrate flaws in this one, as well the long and contentious history of this case that casts doubt on the States ability to come to an agreement themselves, the Court adopts the Masters solution.  Pp.2028.
Exceptions to Special Masters Report overruled, and Masters recommendations adopted.

Syllabus
M&G Polymers USA, LLC, et al. v. Tackett et al.
Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
No. 13 1010. Argued November 10, 2014 Decided January 26, 2015
When petitioner M&G Polymers USA, LLC (M&G), purchased the Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in 2000, it entered a collective-bargaining agreement and related Pension, Insurance, and Service Award Agreement (P & I agreement) with respondent union. As relevant here, the P & I agreement provided that certain retirees, along with their surviving spouses and dependents, would receive a full Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits ; that such benefits would be provided for the duration of [the] Agreement ; and that the agreement would be subject to renegotiation in three years.
 Following the expiration of those agreements, M&G announced that it would require retirees to contribute to the cost of their health care benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, sued M&G and related entities, alleging that the P & I agreement created a vested right to lifetime contribution-free health care benefits.
 The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed based on the reasoning of its earlier decision in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d 1476. On remand, the District Court ruled in favor of the retirees, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held: The Sixth Circuit s decision rested on principles that are incompatible with ordinary principles of contract law. Pp. 5-14.
 (a) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs pension and welfare benefits plans, including those established by collective-bargaining agreements. ERISA establishes minimum funding and vesting standards for pension plans, but exempts welfare benefits plans which provide the types of benefits at issue here from those rules. See 29 U. S. C. 1051(1), 1053, 1081(a)(2), 1083. [E]mployers have large leeway to design .  .  . welfare plans as they see fit. Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822 . Pp. 5-7.
 (b) This Court interprets collective-bargaining agreements, including those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary principles of contract law, at least when those principles are not inconsistent with federal labor policy. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448 457. When a collective-bargaining agreement is unambiguous, its meaning must be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent. 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts 30:6, p. 108. P. 7.
 (c) In Yard-Man, the Sixth Circuit found a provision governing retiree insurance benefits ambiguous as to the duration of those benefits; and, looking to other provisions of the agreement, purported to apply ordinary contract law to resolve the ambiguity. First, the court inferred from the existence of termination provisions for other benefits that the absence of a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits expressed an intent to vest those benefits for life. The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises, reasoning that, absent vesting, the promise would be illusory for the subset of retirees who would not become eligible for those benefits before the contract expired. Finally, the court relied on the context of labor negotiations to resolve the ambiguity, inferring that the parties would have intended such benefits to vest for life because they are not mandatory subjects of collective bargaining; are typically understood as a form of delayed compensation, 716 F. 2d, at 1482; and are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status. The court concluded that these contextual clues outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause. Id., at 1483. The Sixth Circuit has since extended its Yard-Man analysis in a series of other cases. Pp. 7-10.
 (d) The inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny do not represent ordinary principles of contract law. Yard-Man distorts the attempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agreements. Rather than relying on known customs and usages in a particular industry as proven by the parties, the Yard-Man court relied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiating retiree benefits. It then compounded the error by applying those suppositions indiscriminately across industries. Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit s refusal to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement s text and conflicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.
 Perhaps tugged by its inferences, the Sixth Circuit also misapplied the illusory promises doctrine. It construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class of retirees as illusory merely because they did not benefit all retirees. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms a promise that is partly illusory is by definition not illusory. And its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the context of collective-bargaining agreements, which often include provisions inapplicable to some category of employees. 
 The Sixth Circuit also failed even to consider other traditional contract principles, including the rule that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement, Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190 . Pp. 10-14.
 (e) Though there is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affected the outcome here, the Sixth Circuit should be the first to review the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law. P. 14.
733 F. 3d 589, vacated and remanded.
 Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

The court concluded that these contextual clues outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause. Id., at 1483. The Sixth Circuit has since extended its Yard-Man analysis in a series of other cases. Pp. 7-10.
 (d) The inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny do not represent ordinary principles of contract law. Yard-Man distorts the attempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agreements. Rather than relying on known customs and usages in a particular industry as proven by the parties, the Yard-Man court relied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiating retiree benefits. It then compounded the error by applying those suppositions indiscriminately across industries. Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit s refusal to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement s text and conflicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.
 Perhaps tugged by its inferences, the Sixth Circuit also misapplied the illusory promises doctrine. It construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class of retirees as illusory merely because they did not benefit all retirees. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms a promise that is partly illusory is by definition not illusory. And its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the context of collective-bargaining agreements, which often include provisions inapplicable to some category of employees. 
 The Sixth Circuit also failed even to consider other traditional contract principles, including the rule that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement, Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190 . Pp. 10-14.
 (e) Though there is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affected the outcome here, the Sixth Circuit should be the first to review the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law. P. 14.

			M&G purchased the Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in 2000 and entered a collective bargaining agreement and a related Pension, Insurance, and Service Award Agreement with the union, providing that certain retirees, surviving spouses, and dependents, would receive a full Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits; that such benefits would be provided for the duration of [the] Agreement; and that the Agreement would be subject to renegotiation in three years. After the expiration, M&G announced that it would require retirees to contribute to the cost of their health care benefits. Retirees sued, alleging that the 2000 Agreement created a vested right to lifetime contribution-free health care benefits. On remand, the district court ruled in favor of the retirees; the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, noting that welfare benefits plans are exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. 1051(1), 1053, 1081(a)(2), 1083, and applying ordinary principles of contract law. The Court stated that Sixth Circuit precedent distorts ordinary principles of contract law, which attempt to ascertain the intention of the parties, by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agreements.  The Sixth Circuit did not consider the rules that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and that contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement.

gelboim etal. v. bank of america corp. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 131174.Argued December 9, 2014Decided January 21, 2015
Three legal prescriptions figure in this case.  Title

28 U.S.C. 1291 gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States, and its core application is to rulings that terminate an action.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising multiple claims.  And

28 U.S.C. 1407 authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact ... to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in order to promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions, 1407(a).

            
        
            
        The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United States and globally.  The JPML established a multidistrict litigation (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that defendant-banks understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors.  Over 60 actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, including a class action filed by petitioners Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher, who raised the single claim that several banks, acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law.  Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks motion to dismiss all antitrust claims, including the Gelboim-Zacher complaints sole claim.  The District Court thus dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher complaint, denied leave to amend, and dismissed the case in its entirety.  Other cases made part of the LIBOR MDL, however, presented discrete claims which remained before the District Court.  Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under 1291, the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications authorizing the plaintiffs in some of the multiple-claim actions to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the District Court.  On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the order appealed from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.  The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications.
Held:The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim and Zacher from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their right to appeal under 1291.

            
        Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qualify under 1291 as an appealable final decision.  Section 1407 refers to individual actions transferrable to a single district court, not to a monolithic multidistrict action created by transfer.  See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach,

523 U.S. 26
.  And 1407(a)s languageat or before the conclusion of ... pretrial proceedings, each transferred action must be remanded to the originating district unless [the action] shall have been previously terminatedindicates Congress anticipation that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated pursuant to 1407.  The District Courts order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint was a final decision.  The District Court completed its adjudication of petitioners complaint and terminated their action.  Petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings.  Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil action with other LIBOR MDL cases renders the dismissal of their complaint tentative or incomplete.  

            
        To hold, as the banks contend, that no appeal of right accrues until a 1407 consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the 30-day period for taking an appeal.  The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this, where the transferee court in an MDL grants a defendants dispositive motion on every claim (or the sole claim) in a transferred case.  The banks are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while leaving those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because they have other pending claims.  But that concern is attended to by Rule 54(b), which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to parties with multiple-claim complaints, thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review of discrete claims.  The District Court did that in this very case.  Rule 54(b), however, is of no avail to Gelboim and Zacher, who asserted only one claim.  See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey,

351 U.S. 427
.  Section 1292(b)which allows district courts to designate for review certain interlocutory ordersis also inapposite here, for there is nothing interlocutory about the dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.  Pp.610.
Reversed and remanded.

hana financial, inc. v. hana bank etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 131211.Argued December 3, 2014Decided January 21, 2015
Petitioner, Hana Financial, Inc., and respondent Hana Bank both provide financial services to individuals in the United States.  When Hana Financial sued Hana Bank for trademark infringement, Hana Bank invoked in defense the tacking doctrine, under which lower courts have provided that a trademark user may make certain modifications to its mark over time while, in limited circumstances, retaining its priority position.  Petitioners claim was tried before a jury, and the District Court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction on tacking proposed by petitioner.  The jury returned a verdict in respondents favor.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit explained that the tacking inquiry was an exceptionally limited and highly fact-sensitive matter reserved for juries, not judges.
Held:Whether two trademarks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority is a question for the jury.  Pp.38.

            
        (a)Lower courts have held that two marks may be tacked when they are considered to be legal equivalents, i.e., they create the same, continuing commercial impression.  Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v. Wear-Guard Corp. 926 F.2d 1156, 1159.  And commercial impression must be viewed through the eyes of a consumer.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1253.  When the relevant question is how an ordinary person or community would make an assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide the fact-intensive answer.  See, e.g., United States v. Gaudin,

515 U.S. 506
.  Pp.35.

            
        (b)Each of petitioners four arguments in support of its view that tacking is a question of law to be resolved by a judge is unpersuasive.  First, it may be true that the legal equivalents test involves a legal standard, but such mixed question[s] of law and fact, [have] typi-cally been resolved by juries.  Gaudin, 515 U.S., at 512.  And any concern that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard can be remedied by crafting careful jury instructions.  Second, petitioner offers no support for its claim that tacking determinations create new law in a unique way that requires those determinations to be reserved for judges.  Third, petitioner worries that the predictability required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking questions are assigned to juries, but offers no reason why trademark tacking should be treated differently from the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems, where juries answer often-dispositive factual questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to facts.  Finally, in arguing that judges have historically resolved tacking disputes, petitioner points to cases arising in the contexts of bench trials, summary judgment, and the like, in which it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking disputes.

department of homeland security v. maclean
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13894.Argued November 4, 2014Decided  January 21, 2015
In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act,

116Stat.
2135.  That Act provides that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information ... if the Under Secretary decides that disclosur[e] would ... be detrimental to the security of transportation.

49 U.S.C. 114(r)(1)(C).  Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information, 67 Fed. Reg. 8351, which included [s]pecific details of aviation security measures ... [such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations, 49 CFR 1520.7(j).

            
        
            
        In July 2003, the TSA briefed all federal air marshalsincluding Robert J. MacLeanabout a potential plot to hijack passenger flights.  A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas until early August.  MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous and illegal.  He therefore contacted a reporter and told him about the TSAs decision to cancel the missions.  After discovering that MacLean was the source of the disclosure, the TSA fired him for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.

            
        MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  He argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity under

5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)(A), which protects employees who disclose information that reveals any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection under that statute because his disclosure was specifically prohibited by law, 2302(b)(8)(A)namely, by

49 U.S.C. 114(r)(1).  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Boards decision, holding that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.
Held:MacLeans disclosure was not specifically prohibited by law.  Pp.516.

            
        (a) The Government argues that MacLeans disclosure was specifically prohibited by law in two ways: first, by the TSAs regulations on sensitive security information, and second, by Section 114(r)(1) itself, which authorized the TSA to promulgate those regulations.  Pp.514.

            
        
            
        (i) MacLeans disclosure was not prohibited by the TSAs regulations for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) because regulations do not qualify as law under that statute.  Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly used the phrase law, rule, or regulation.  But Congress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here; it used the word law standing alone.  Congresss choice to say specifically prohibited by law, instead of specifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.  In addition, Section 2302(b)(8)(A) creates a second exception for disclosures required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.  That the second exception is limited to actions by the President himself suggests that the first exception does not include action taken by executive agencies.  Finally, interpreting the word law to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.  That interpretation would allow an agency to insulate itself from Section 2302(b)(8)(A) simply by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited all whistleblowing.

            
        The Government proposes two alternative interpretations, but neither is persuasive.  First, the Government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law.  The Government bases this argument on the decision in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,

441 U.S. 281
, where this Court held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law unless there is a clear showing of contrary legislative intent.  Id., at 295296.  But Congresss use of the word law, in close connection with the phrase law, rule, or regulation, provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations in this case.  Second, the Government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.  The Government, however, was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.  Pp.611.

            
        
            
        (ii) Likewise, MacLeans disclosure was not prohibited by Section 114(r)(1).  That statute does not prohibit anything; instead, it authorizes the TSA to prescribe regulations.  Thus, by its terms, Section 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure here.  The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLeans disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that effect.

department of homeland security v. maclean
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13894.Argued November 4, 2014Decided  January 21, 2015
In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act,

116Stat.
2135.  That Act provides that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information ... if the Under Secretary decides that disclosur[e] would ... be detrimental to the security of transportation.

49 U.S.C. 114(r)(1)(C).  Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information, 67 Fed. Reg. 8351, which included [s]pecific details of aviation security measures ... [such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations, 49 CFR 1520.7(j).

            
        
            
        In July 2003, the TSA briefed all federal air marshalsincluding Robert J. MacLeanabout a potential plot to hijack passenger flights.  A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas until early August.  MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous and illegal.  He therefore contacted a reporter and told him about the TSAs decision to cancel the missions.  After discovering that MacLean was the source of the disclosure, the TSA fired him for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.

            
        MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  He argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity under

5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)(A), which protects employees who disclose information that reveals any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection under that statute because his disclosure was specifically prohibited by law, 2302(b)(8)(A)namely, by

49 U.S.C. 114(r)(1).  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Boards decision, holding that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.
Held:MacLeans disclosure was not specifically prohibited by law.  Pp.516.

            
        (a) The Government argues that MacLeans disclosure was specifically prohibited by law in two ways: first, by the TSAs regulations on sensitive security information, and second, by Section 114(r)(1) itself, which authorized the TSA to promulgate those regulations.  Pp.514.

            
        
            
        (i) MacLeans disclosure was not prohibited by the TSAs regulations for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) because regulations do not qualify as law under that statute.  Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly used the phrase law, rule, or regulation.  But Congress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here; it used the word law standing alone.  Congresss choice to say specifically prohibited by law, instead of specifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.  In addition, Section 2302(b)(8)(A) creates a second exception for disclosures required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.  That the second exception is limited to actions by the President himself suggests that the first exception does not include action taken by executive agencies.  Finally, interpreting the word law to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.  That interpretation would allow an agency to insulate itself from Section 2302(b)(8)(A) simply by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited all whistleblowing.

            
        The Government proposes two alternative interpretations, but neither is persuasive.  First, the Government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law.  The Government bases this argument on the decision in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,

441 U.S. 281
, where this Court held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law unless there is a clear showing of contrary legislative intent.  Id., at 295296.  But Congresss use of the word law, in close connection with the phrase law, rule, or regulation, provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations in this case.  Second, the Government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.  The Government, however, was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.  Pp.611.

            
        
            
        (ii) Likewise, MacLeans disclosure was not prohibited by Section 114(r)(1).  That statute does not prohibit anything; instead, it authorizes the TSA to prescribe regulations.  Thus, by its terms, Section 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure here.  The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLeans disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that effect.  But the statute affords substantial discretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.  Thus, it is the TSAs regulationsnot the statutethat prohibited MacLeans disclosure, and those regulations do not qualify as law under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  Pp.1114.

            
        (b)  The Government argues that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like MacLean would gravely endanger public safety by making the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSAs 60,000 employees.  Those concerns are legitimate, but they must be addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court.  Pp.1415.
714 F.3d. 1301, affirmed.

            
        Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.  Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kennedy, J., joined.

			The 2002 Homeland Security Act provides that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information . . . if the Under Secretary decides that disclosur[e] would . . . be detrimental to the security of transportation, 49 U.S.C. 114(r)(1)(C).

The Federal Circuit vacated. The Supreme Court affirmed. MacLeans disclosure was not specifically prohibited by law because regulations do not qualify as law under the whistleblower statute. Interpreting the word law to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the statute, allowing an agency to insulate itself simply by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited all whistleblowing. MacLeans disclosure was not prohibited by Section 114(r)(1). That statute does not prohibit anything, but only authorizes TSA to prescribe regulations.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 136827.Argued October 7, 2014Decided January 20, 2015
Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) provides that [n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an institutionalized person unless the government demonstrates that the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.

42 U.S.C. 2000cc1(a).

            
        
            
        Petitioner is an Arkansas inmate and devout Muslim who wishes to grow a -inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs.  Respondent Arkansas Department of Correction (Department) prohibits its prisoners from growing beards, with the single exception that inmates with diagnosed skin conditions may grow -inch beards.  Petitioner sought an exemption on religious grounds and, although he believes that his faith requires him not to trim his beard at all, he proposed a compromise under which he would be allowed to maintain a -inch beard.  Prison officials denied his request, and petitioner sued in Federal District Court.  At an evidentiary hearing before a Magistrate Judge, Department witnesses testified that beards compromised prison safety because they could be used to hide contraband and because an inmate could quickly shave his beard to disguise his identity.  The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing petitioners complaint, emphasizing that prison officials are entitled to deference on security matters and that the prison permitted petitioner to exercise his religion in other ways.  The District Court adopted the recommendation in full, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Department had satisfied its burden of showing that the grooming policy was the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling security interests, and reiterating that courts should defer to prison officials on matters of security.
Held:The Departments grooming policy violates RLUIPA insofar as it prevents petitioner from growing a -inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs.  Pp.616.

            
        (a)Under RLUIPA, the challenging party bears the initial burden of proving that his religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely held religious belief, see Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. ___, ___, n. 28, and that the governments action substantially burdens his religious exercise.  Here, petitioners sincerity is not in dispute, and he easily satisfies the second obligation.  The Departments policy forces him to choose between engag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious belie[f], id., at ___, or contravening the grooming policy and risking disciplinary action.  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the District Court misunderstood the analysis that RLUIPA demands.  First, the District Court erred by concluding that the grooming policy did not substantially burden petitioners religious exercise because he could practice his religion in other ways.  Second, the District Court erroneously suggested that the burden on petitioners religious exercise was slight because petitioner testified that his religion would credit him for attempting to follow his religious beliefs, even if that attempt proved unsuccessful.  RLUIPA, however, applies to religious exercise regardless of whether it is compelled.  2000cc5(7)(A).  Finally, the District Court improperly relied on petitioners testimony that not all Muslims believe that men must grow beards.  Even if petitioners belief were idiosyncratic, RLUIPAs guarantees are not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.  Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,

450 U.S. 707
716.  Pp.68.

            
        (b)Once the challenging party satisfies his burden, the burden shifts to the government to show that substantially burdening the religious exercise of the particular claimant is the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.  Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___; 2000cc1(a).  The Department fails to show that enforcing its beard prohibition against petitioner furthers its compelling interests in preventing prisoners from hiding contraband and disguising their identities.  Pp.813.

            
        
            
        (i) While the Department has a compelling interest in regulating contraband, its argument that this interest is compromised by allowing an inmate to grow a -inch beard is unavailing, especially given the difficulty of hiding contraband in such a short beard and the lack of a corresponding policy regulating the length of hair on the head.  RLUIPA does not permit the unquestioning deference required to accept the Departments assessment.  See Gonzales v. O Centro Esprita Beneficente Unio do Vegetal,

546 U.S. 418
.  Even if the Department could show that denying petitioner a -inch beard furthers its interest in rooting out contraband, it would still have to show that its policy is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest, a standard that is exceptionally demanding and requires the government to sho[w] that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting part[y].  Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___.  Here, the Department fails to establish that its security concerns cannot be satisfied by simply searching a -inch beard.  Pp.911.

            
        
            
        (ii)Even if the Departments grooming policy furthers its compelling interest in prisoner identification, its policy still violates RLUIPA as applied in the present circumstances.  As petitioner argues, re-quiring inmates to be photographed both with and without beards and then periodically thereafter is a less restrictive means of solving the Departments identification concerns.  The Department fails to show why its prison system is so different from the many institutions that allow facial hair that the dual-photo method cannot be employed at its institutions.  It also fails to show why the security risk presented by a prisoner shaving a -inch beard is so different from the risk of a prisoner shaving a mustache, head hair, or -inch beard.  Pp.1113.

            
        (c)In addition to the Departments failure to prove that petitioners proposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security interests, the Department also fails to adequately explain the substantial underinclusiveness of its policy, since it permits -inch beards for prisoners with medical conditions and more than  inch of hair on the head.  Its failure to pursue its proffered objectives with regard to such analogous nonreligious conduct suggests that its interests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to a far lesser degree.  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,

508 U.S. 520
.   Nor does the Department explain why the vast majority of States and the Federal Government can permit inmates to grow -inch beards, either for any reason or for religious reasons, but it cannot.  Such evidence requires a prison, at a minimum, to offer persuasive reasons why it believes it must take a different course.  See Procunier v. Martinez,

teva pharmaceuticals usa, inc., etal. v. sandoz, inc., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13854.Argued October 15, 2014Decided  January 20, 2015
Petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals (and related firms), own a patent that covers a manufacturing method for the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.  When respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and other firms), tried to market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued them for patent infringement.  Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid.  Specifically, Sandoz argued that the claim that Copaxones active ingredient had a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons was fatally indefinite, see

35 U.S.C. 112 2, because it did not state which of three methods of calculationthe weight of the most prevalent molecule, the weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for morewas used to determine that weight.  After considering conflicting expert evidence, the District Court concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid.  As relevant here, it found that in context a skilled artisan would understand that the term molecular weight referred to molecular weight as calculated by the first method.  In finding the molecular weight term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal, the Federal Circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Courts claim construction, including the District Courts determination of subsidiary facts.
Held:When reviewing a district courts resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a clear error, not a de novo, standard of review.  Pp.416.

            
        (a)Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of appeals must not ... set aside a district courts [f]indings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.  It sets out a clear command, Anderson v. Bessemer City,

470 U.S. 564
, and does not make exceptions or ... exclude certain categories of factual findings from the court of appeals obligation, Pullman-Standard v. Swint,

456 U.S. 273
.  The Rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts.  Ibid.  And the function of an appeals court reviewing the findings of a district court sitting without a jury ... is not to decide factual issues denovo.  Anderson, supra, at 573.  Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, there is no convincing ground for creating an exception here.  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,

517 U.S. 370
, neither created, nor argued for, such an exception.  There, the Court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for the judge, not the jury, id., at 372, but it did not thereby create an exception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.  Instead, the Court pointed out that a judge, in construing a patent claim, is engaged in much the same task as the judge would be in construing other written instruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs.  Id., at 384, 386, 388, 389.  Construction of written instruments often presents a question solely of law, at least when the words in those instruments are used in their ordinary meaning.  Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co.,

259 U. S. 285
.  But if a written instrument uses technical words or phrases not commonly understood, id., at 292, those words may give rise to a factual dispute.  If so, extrinsic evidence may help to establish a usage of trade or locality.  Ibid.  And in that circumstance, the determination of the matter of fact will preced[e] the function of construction.  Ibid.

The Markman Court also recognized that courts will sometimes have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction;  Rule 52 requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the clearly erroneous standard.  Application of this standard is further supported by precedent and by practical considerations.  Clear error review is particularly important in patent cases because a district court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entire proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the necessary familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles, Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.,

339 U.S. 605
, than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties.  Pp.48.

            
        (b)Arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  Sandoz claims that separating factual from legal questions may be difficult and, like the Federal Circuit, posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to review the entirety of the district courts claim construction de novo than to apply two separate standards.  But courts of appeals have long been able to separate factual from legal matters, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,

teva pharmaceuticals usa, inc., etal. v. sandoz, inc., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 13854.Argued October 15, 2014Decided  January 20, 2015
Petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals (and related firms), own a patent that covers a manufacturing method for the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.  When respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and other firms), tried to market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued them for patent infringement.  Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid.  Specifically, Sandoz argued that the claim that Copaxones active ingredient had a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons was fatally indefinite, see

35 U.S.C. 112 2, because it did not state which of three methods of calculationthe weight of the most prevalent molecule, the weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for morewas used to determine that weight.  After considering conflicting expert evidence, the District Court concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid.  As relevant here, it found that in context a skilled artisan would understand that the term molecular weight referred to molecular weight as calculated by the first method.  In finding the molecular weight term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal, the Federal Circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Courts claim construction, including the District Courts determination of subsidiary facts.
Held:When reviewing a district courts resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a clear error, not a de novo, standard of review.  Pp.416.

            
        (a)Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of appeals must not ... set aside a district courts [f]indings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.  It sets out a clear command, Anderson v. Bessemer City,

470 U.S. 564
, and does not make exceptions or ... exclude certain categories of factual findings from the court of appeals obligation, Pullman-Standard v. Swint,

456 U.S. 273
.  The Rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts.  Ibid.  And the function of an appeals court reviewing the findings of a district court sitting without a jury ... is not to decide factual issues denovo.  Anderson, supra, at 573.  Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, there is no convincing ground for creating an exception here.  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,

517 U.S. 370
, neither created, nor argued for, such an exception.  There, the Court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for the judge, not the jury, id., at 372, but it did not thereby create an exception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.  Instead, the Court pointed out that a judge, in construing a patent claim, is engaged in much the same task as the judge would be in construing other written instruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs.  Id., at 384, 386, 388, 389.  Construction of written instruments often presents a question solely of law, at least when the words in those instruments are used in their ordinary meaning.  Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co.,

259 U. S. 285
.  But if a written instrument uses technical words or phrases not commonly understood, id., at 292, those words may give rise to a factual dispute.  If so, extrinsic evidence may help to establish a usage of trade or locality.  Ibid.  And in that circumstance, the determination of the matter of fact will preced[e] the function of construction.  Ibid.

The Markman Court also recognized that courts will sometimes have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction;  Rule 52 requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the clearly erroneous standard.  Application of this standard is further supported by precedent and by practical considerations.  Clear error review is particularly important in patent cases because a district court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entire proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the necessary familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles, Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.,

339 U.S. 605
, than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties.  Pp.48.

            
        (b)Arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  Sandoz claims that separating factual from legal questions may be difficult and, like the Federal Circuit, posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to review the entirety of the district courts claim construction de novo than to apply two separate standards.  But courts of appeals have long been able to separate factual from legal matters, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,

514 U.S. 938
948, and the Federal Circuits efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclusions similarly have brought with them their own complexities.  As for Sandozs argument that clear error review will bring about less uniformity, neither the Circuit nor Sandoz has shown that divergent claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on subsidiary matters should occur more than occasionally.  Pp.811. 

            
        (c)This leaves the question of how the clear error standard should be applied when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim construction. When the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent, the judges determination is solely a determination of law, and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.

			Tevas patent covers a multiple sclerosis drug.  When Sandoz tried to market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued for infringement. Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid because a claim that the active ingredient had a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons was indefinite under 35 U. S. C. 112, for not stating which of three methods was used to determine that weight. The district court upheld the patent. Reversing, the Federal Circuit reviewed all aspects of claim construction de novo, including the determination of subsidiary facts. The Supreme Court vacated. When reviewing a district courts resolution of subsidiary factual matters made during construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a clear error, not a de novo, standard of review. FRCP 52(a)(6) states: a court of appeals must not set aside [f]indings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Clear error review is particularly important in patent cases because a district judge has more opportunity to gain familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles than an appeals judge who must read a written transcript. When reviewing only evidence intrinsic to the patent, the judges determination is a determination of law, and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo; where the court needs to consult disputed extrinsic evidence to understand, for example, background science, courts need to make subsidiary factual findings about the extrinsic evidence. The ultimate construction of the claim is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review, but to overturn resolution of an underlying factual dispute, the appellate court must find that the judge, in respect to those findings, committed clear error. Here, the district court made a factual finding, crediting Tevas experts account about how a skilled artisan would understand molecular weights. When the Federal Circuit reviewed the decision, it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the determination was clearly erroneous.

14-6873|"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MARK A. CHRISTESON v. DON ROPER, WARDEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 146873.Decided January 20, 2015
continuousevenrId9defaultrId10firstrId13

            
        Per Curiam.

            
        Petitioner Mark Christesons first federal habeas petition was dismissed as untimely.  Because his appointed attorneyswho had missed the filing deadlinecould not be expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, Christeson requested substitute counsel who would not be laboring under a conflict of interest.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit summarily affirmed.  In so doing, these courts contravened our decision in Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. ___ (2012).  Christesons petition for certiorari is therefore granted, the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
I

            
        In 1999, a jury convicted Christeson of three counts of capital murder.  It returned verdicts of death on allthree counts.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed Christesons conviction and sentence in 2001, see State v. Christeson, 50 S. W. 3d 251 (en banc), and affirmed the denial of his postconviction motion for relief in 2004, see Christeson v. State, 131 S. W. 3d 796 (en banc).

            
        Under the strict 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),

28 U. S. C. 2244(d)(1), Christesons federal habeas petition was due on April 10, 2005.  Nine months before this critical deadline, the District Court appointed attorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent Christeson in his federal habeas proceedings.  See

18 U.S.C. 3599(a)(2) (providing for appointment of counsel for state death row inmates).  

            
        Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowledged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six weeks after his petition was due.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a. There is no evidence that they communicated with their client at all during this time.  They finally filed the petition on August 5, 2005117 days too late.  They have since claimed that their failure to meet with their client and timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple miscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in defending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged client communications).  See id., at 90a92a, 135a.  But a legal ethics expert, reviewing counsels handling of Christesons habeas petition, stated in a report submitted to the District Court: [I]f this was not abandonment, I am not sure what would be.  Id., at 132a.  

            
        The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely, and the Court of Appeals denied Christesons application for a certificate of appealability.  Christeson, who appears to have severe cognitive disabilities that lead him to rely entirely on his attorneys, may not have been aware of this dismissal.  See id., at 229a, 231a, 237a.

            
        Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted attorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to discuss how to proceed in Christesons case.  Merrigan and Perkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem.  Christesons only hope for securing review of the merits of his habeas claims was to file a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking to reopen final judgment on the ground that AEDPAs statute of limitations should have been equitably tolled.  But Horwitz and Butts could not be expected to file such a motion on Christesons behalf, as any argument for equitable tolling would be premised on their own malfeasance in failing to file timely the habeas petition.  While initially receptive to Merrigan and Perkovichs assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to allow outside counsel access to their files.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 345a.  

            
        On May 23, 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich filed a motion for substitution of counsel.  The District Court denied the motion, explaining only that it was not in [Christesons] best interest to be represented by attorneys located in New York and Pennsylvania, as Merrigan and Perkovich are.  Id., at 169a.  The District Court did not address Merrigan and Perkovichs offer to forgo all fees and expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it address the possibility of appointing other attorneys for Christeson.

            
        Christeson appealed.  The Eighth Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan and Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on Christesons behalf.[1]  On September 19, 2014, while this appeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the Missouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution setting October 29, 2014, as Christesons execution date.

            
        After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan and Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of counsel on Christesons behalf.  The District Court again denied the motion.  Explaining that substitution offederally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would serve the interests of justice, it offered four reasons for its decision.  Order in No. 04CV08004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22, 2014), p.1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v. Secretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246, 1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).  First, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it was not filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christesons] execution date.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a.  Second, it observed that Horwitz and Butts had not abandoned Christeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in a class-action lawsuit challenging Missouris lethal injection protocol.  Id., at 376a.  Third, it noted that although Horwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the Eighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute counsel.  Ibid.  Fourth and finally, the District Court expressed its belief that granting the motion would set an untenable precedent by allowing outside attorneys to seek abusive delays in capital cases.  Ibid.

            
        Christeson again appealed.  This time, the Eighth Circuit summarily affirmed the District Courts order.  We stayed Christesons execution, see post, p. ____, and now reverse.
II

            
        Title

18 U. S. C. 3599 entitles indigent defendants to the appointment of counsel in capital cases, including habeas corpus proceedings.  Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in these proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.  McFarland v. Scott,

512 U. S. 849,
859 (1994)
.  Congress has not, however, conferred capital habeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.  Instead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a properly qualified attorney.  See 3599(a)(d).  But the statute contemplates that a court may replace appointed counsel with similarly qualified counsel ... upon motion of the petitioner.  3599(e).

            
        We addressed the standard that a court should apply in considering such a motion in Clair.  We rejected the argument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is warranted in only three situations: when the lawyer lacks the qualifications necessary for appointment ... ; when he has a disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely abandoned the client.  565 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, we adopted a broader standard, holding that a motion for substitution should be granted when it is in the interests of justice.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  We further explained that the factors a court of appeals should consider in determining whether a district court abused its discretion in denying such a motion include: the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district courts inquiry into the defendants complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client (and the clients responsibility, if any, for that conflict).  Ibid.

            
        The District Court here properly recognized that its consideration of Christesons motion for substitution was governed by Clairs interests of justice standard.  But its denial of his motion did not adequately account for all of the factors we set forth in Clair.

            
        The courts principal error was its failure to acknowledge Horwitz and Butts conflict of interest.  Tolling based on counsels failure to satisfy AEDPAs statute of limitations is available only for serious instances of attorney misconduct.  Holland v. Florida,

560 U. S. 631
652 (2010).  Advancing such a claim would have required Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own performance.  Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make such an argument, which threatens their professional reputation and livelihood.  See Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers 125 (1998).  Thus, as we observed in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.S. ___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n.8), a significant conflict of interest arises when an attorneys interest in avoiding damage to [his] own reputation is at odds with his clients strongest argumenti.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him.

            
        Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged the nature of their conflict.  Shortly before the first motion for substitution was filed, they provided an update to the Missouri Supreme Court on the status of Christesons collateral proceedings.  In it, they stated:
Because counsel herein would be essential witnesses to factual questions indispensable to a Holland inquiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigating issues that would support a Holland claim.  Unwaivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit undersigned counsel from litigating these issues in any way.  See Holloway v. Arkansas,

435 U. S. 475
486 (1978).  Conflict free counsel must be appointed to present the equitable tolling question in federal district court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a49a.

            
        Yet, in their response to the District Courts order to address the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts characterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable tolling as ludicrous, and asserted that they had a legal basis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the filing date.  Id., at 86a, 90a.  While not every case in which a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPAs statute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of interest, Horwitz and Butts contentions here were directly and concededly contrary to their clients interest, and manifestly served their own professional and reputational interests.  

Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds for substitution.  Even the narrower standard we rejected in that case would have allowed for substitution where an attorney has a disabling conflict of interest.  565 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  And that standard, we concluded, would gu[t] the specific substitution-of-counsel clause contained in 3559(e), which must contemplate the granting of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a petitioner effectively has no counsel at allas is the case when counsel is conflicted.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Indeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital defendants statutory right to counsel, even in the absence of 3599(e) a district court would be compelled to appoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a conflict.  Ibid.

            
        Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the considerations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its decision to deny petitioner new counsel.  The second and third factors noted by the District Courtthat appointed counsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation challenging the means of his execution, and that the Eighth Circuit had not previously substituted counselare not substantial.  Whether Horwitz and Butts had currently abandoned Christeson is beside the point: Even if they were actively representing him in some matters, their conflict prevented them from representing him in this particular matter.  Likewise, it is irrelevant that the Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed substitution of counsel in the course of denying Christesons request for a certificate of appealabilty and adjudicating his challenge to Missouris execution protocol, when the conflict was not evident.

            
        The first and fourth factors cited by the District Courtthe delay in seeking substitution and the potential for abusemight be valid considerations in many cases.  See Clair, 565 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (Protecting against abusive delay is an interest of justice).  But under the circumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant denial of substitution.  Christesons first substitution motion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive.  It was filed approximately a month after outside counsel became aware of Christesons plight and well before the State had set an execution date, and it requested only 90 days to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.

            
        Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substitute counsel might file on Christesons behalf would be futile.  See id., at ___  ___ (slip op., at 1516) (affirming denial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing made by substitute counsel would have been futile).  To be sure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to having a federal court consider his habeas petition.  Al-though Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby,

545 U.S. 524
536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demonstrate both the motions timeliness and, more significant here, that extraordinary circumstances justif[y] the reopening of a final judgment.  Id., at 535 (quoting Ackermann v. United States,

340 U. S. 193,
199 (1950)
).  That, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was entitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPAs statute of limitations.  He should have that opportunity, and is entitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.
***

            
        The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case isremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

			In 1999, Christeson was convicted of three counts of capital murder and sentenced to death. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed Christesons conviction and sentence and denial of his post-conviction motion for relief. Under the one-year limitations period imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28 U. S. C. 244(d)(1), Christesons federal habeas petition was due on April 10, 2005.

They finally filed the petition 117 days late.  The district court dismissed; the Eighth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability. Christeson, who has severe cognitive disabilities, relied entirely on his attorneys, and may not have known of the dismissal. About seven years later, the attorneys contacted attorneys Merrigan and Perkovich to discuss Christesons case. Christesons only hope for merits review was to move under FRCP60(b) to reopen final judgment on the ground that AEDPAs statute of limitations should have been equitably tolled. Horwitz and Butts would not file that motion, premised on their own malfeasance. In 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich unsuccessfully moved to substitute counsel. The Eighth Circuit dismissed, reasoning that they were not authorized to file on Christesons behalf. The Missouri Supreme Court set an October 29, 2014 execution date.  The district court denied a second motion as untimely, stating that Horwitz and Butts had not abandoned Christeson, and reasoning that allowing the motion would permit abusive delays in capital cases.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court stayed execution and reversed, stating that the denials contravened its 2012 decision, Martel v. Clair, concerning the interests of justice standard, and noting the obvious conflict of interest with respect to the original attorneys.

jennings v. stephens, director, texas department of criminal justice, correctional institutions division
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 137211.Argued October 15, 2014Decided January 14, 2015
Petitioner Jennings sought federal habeas relief based on three theories of ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of his state capital murder trial.  The District Court granted relief on his two Wiggins theoriesthat counsel failed to present evidence of a deprived background and failed to investigate evidence of mental impairment, see Wiggins v. Smith,

539 U.S. 510
but not on his Spisak theorythat counsel expressed resignation to a death sentence during his closing argument, see Smith v. Spisak,

558 U.S. 139
.  The court ordered Texas to release Jennings unless, within 120 days, the State granted him a new sentencing hearing or commuted his death sentence.  The State attacked the Wiggins theories on appeal, but Jennings defended on all three theories.  The Fifth Circuit reversed the grant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim.  Implicitly concluding that raising this argument required a cross-appeal, the court noted that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A), nor obtained the certificate of appealability required by

The States rights under the judgment were to retain Jennings in custody pending retrial or to commute his sentence; the Spisak claim, if accepted, would not further encumber the State.  The State contends that, because the District Courts opinion entitled Jennings only to retrial (or resentencing) without the challenged errors, each additional basis asserted by Jennings sought to lessen the States rights at retrial, and thus requires a cross-appeal.  But this view is contrary to the ordinary behavior of courts, which reduce their opinions and verdicts to judgments precisely to define the parties rights and liabilities.  A prevailing party seeks to enforce a district courts judgment, not its reasoning.  Rogers v. Hill,

jennings v. stephens, director, texas department of criminal justice, correctional institutions division
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 137211.Argued October 15, 2014Decided January 14, 2015
Petitioner Jennings sought federal habeas relief based on three theories of ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of his state capital murder trial.  The District Court granted relief on his two Wiggins theoriesthat counsel failed to present evidence of a deprived background and failed to investigate evidence of mental impairment, see Wiggins v. Smith,

539 U.S. 510
but not on his Spisak theorythat counsel expressed resignation to a death sentence during his closing argument, see Smith v. Spisak,

558 U.S. 139
.  The court ordered Texas to release Jennings unless, within 120 days, the State granted him a new sentencing hearing or commuted his death sentence.  The State attacked the Wiggins theories on appeal, but Jennings defended on all three theories.  The Fifth Circuit reversed the grant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim.  Implicitly concluding that raising this argument required a cross-appeal, the court noted that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A), nor obtained the certificate of appealability required by

28 U.S.C. 2253(c).

			Jennings sought federal habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of his state capital murder trial. The district court granted relief on his Wiggins theories, that counsel failed to present evidence of a deprived background and failed to investigate evidence of mental impairment, but not on his Spisak theory, that counsel expressed resignation to a death sentence during his closing argument. The court ordered Texas to release Jennings unless, within 120 days, it granted a new sentencing hearing or commuted his death sentence. The Fifth Circuit reversed with respect to the Wiggins theories and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim, noting that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of appeal nor obtained the certificate of appealability. The Supreme Court reversed. Jennings Spisak theory was a defense of his judgment on alternative grounds, so he was not required to take a cross-appeal or obtain a certificate of appealability to argue it.  Jennings, as an appellee who did not cross-appeal, could urge his Spisak theory unless doing so would enlarge his rights or lessen the states rights under the district courts judgment.  Jennings rights under the judgment were release, retrial, or commutation and his Spisak claim, if accepted, would give him no more.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus
t-mobile south, llc v. city of roswell, georgia
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 13975.Argued November 10, 2014Decided  January 14, 2015
Respondent Roswells city council (Council) held a public hearing to consider an application by petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC, to build a cell phone tower on residential property.  During the hearing, several Council members expressed concerns about the towers impact on the area.  The hearing ended with the Council unanimously passing a motion to deny the application.  Two days later, the Citys Planning and Zoning Division informed petitioner by letter that the application had been denied and that minutes from the hearing would be made available.  The detailed minutes were published 26 days later.

            
        
            
        Petitioner filed suit, alleging that the Councils denial was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.  The District Court agreed, concluding that the City, by failing to issue a written decision stating its reasons for denying the application, had violated the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which provides that a localitys denial shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record,

47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).  The Eleventh Circuit, following its precedent, found that the Acts requirements were satisfied here because petitioner had received a denial letter and possessed a transcript of the hearing that it arranged to have recorded.
Held:

            
        1. Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requires localities to provide reasons when they deny applications to build cell phone towers.  This conclusion follows from the Acts provisions, which both preserve and specifically limit traditional state and local government authority.  It would be considerably difficult for a reviewing court to determine whether a localitys denial was supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record, 332(c)(7)(B)(iii), or whether a locality had unreasonably discriminate[d] among providers of functionally equivalent services, 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), or regulated siting on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions, 332(c)(7)(B)(iv), if localities were not obligated to state their reasons for denial.  And nothing in the Act suggests that Congress meant to use the phrase substantial evidence as anything but an administrative law term of art that describes how an administrative record is to be judged by a reviewing court.  United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co.,

373 U.S. 709
.  Pp.68.

            
        2. Localities are not required to provide their reasons for denying siting applications in the denial notice itself, but may state those reasons with sufficient clarity in some other written record issued essentially contemporaneously with the denial.  Pp.813.

            
        
            
        (a) Nothing in the Acts text imposes a requirement that the reasons be given in any particular form, and the Acts saving clause, 332(c)(7)(A), makes clear that the only limitations imposed on local governments are those enumerated in the statute.  Localities comply with their obligation to give written reasons so long as those reasons are stated clearly enough to enable judicial review.  Because an adversely affected entity must decide whether to seek judicial review within 30 days from the date of the denial, 332(c)(7)(B)(v), and because a court cannot review the denial without knowing the localitys reasons, the locality must provide or make available its written reasons at essentially the same time as it communicates its denial.  Pp.811.

            
        
            
        (b) Petitioners contrary arguments are unavailing.  The statutes word decision does not connote a written document that itself provides all the reasons for a given judgment.  The absence of the word notify in the provision at issue also does not signal an intention to require communication of more than a judgment.  Nor does an obligation to provide reasons in the writing conveying the denial arise from the substantial evidence requirement itself or from the requirement of court review on an expedited basis, 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  It is sufficient that a localitys reasons be provided in a manner that is clear enough and prompt enough to enable judicial review.  Pp.1113.

            
        3. The City failed to comply with its statutory obligations under the Act.  Although it issued its reasons in writing and did so in an acceptable form, it did not provide its written reasons essentially contemporaneously with its written denial when it issued detailed minutes 26 days after the date of the written denial and 4 days before expiration of petitioners time to seek judicial review.

jesinoski et ux. v. countrywide home loans, inc., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 13684.Argued November 4, 2014Decided January 13, 2015
Exactly three years after borrowing money from respondent Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., to refinance their home mortgage, petitioners Larry and Cheryle Jesinoski sent Countrywide and respondent Bank of America Home Loans, which had acquired Countrywide, a letter purporting to rescind the transaction.  Bank of America replied, refusing to acknowledge the rescissions validity.  One year and one day later, the Jesinoskis filed suit in federal court, seeking a declaration of rescission and damages.  The District Court entered judgment on the pleadings for respondents, concluding that a borrower can exercise the Truth in Lending Acts right to rescind a loan, see

15 U.S.C. 1635(a), (f), only by filing a lawsuit within three years of the date the loan was consummated.  The Jesinoskis complaint, filed four years and one day after the loans consummation, was ineffective.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
Held:A borrower exercising his right to rescind under the Act need only provide written notice to his lender within the 3-year period, not file suit within that period.  Section 1635(a)s unequivocal termsa borrower shall have the right to rescind ... by notifying the creditor ... of his intention to do so (emphasis added)leave no doubt that rescission is effected when the borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind.  This conclusion is not altered by 1635(f), which states when the right to rescind must be exercised, but says nothing about how that right is exercised.  Nor does 1635(g)which states that in addition to rescission the court may award relief ... not relating to the right to rescindsupport respondents view that rescission is necessarily a consequence of judicial action.  And the fact that the Act modified the common-law condition precedent to rescission at law, see 1635(b), hardly implies that the Act thereby codified rescission in equity.  Pp.25.

Syllabus
whitfield v. united states
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 139026.Argued December 2, 2014Decided January 13, 2015
Petitioner Whitfield, fleeing a botched bank robbery, entered 79-year-old Mary Parnells home and guided a terrified Parnell from a hallway to a room a few feet away, where she suffered a fatal heart attack.  He was convicted of, among other things, violating

18 U.S.C. 2113(e), which establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person in the course of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery.  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, rejecting his argument that 2113(e) requires substantial movement.  
Held:A bank robber forces [a] person to accompany him, for purposes of 2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance, as was the case here.  At the time the forced-accompaniment provision was enacted, just as today, to accompany someone meant to go with him.  The word does not, as Whitfield contends, connote movement over a substantial distance.  Accompaniment requires movement that would normally be described as from one place to another.  Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet, from one room to another, and that surely sufficed.  The severity of the penalties for a forced-accompaniment convictiona mandatory minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of life imprisonmentdoes not militate against this interpretation, for the danger of a forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the distance traversed.  This reading also does not make any other part of 2113s graduated penalty scheme superfluous.  Pp.25.
548 Fed. Appx. 70, affirmed.

            
        Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, rejecting his argument that 2113(e) requires substantial movement.  
Held:A bank robber forces [a] person to accompany him, for purposes of 2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance, as was the case here.  At the time the forced-accompaniment provision was enacted, just as today, to accompany someone meant to go with him.  The word does not, as Whitfield contends, connote movement over a substantial distance.  Accompaniment requires movement that would normally be described as from one place to another.  Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet, from one room to another, and that surely sufficed.  The severity of the penalties for a forced-accompaniment convictiona mandatory minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of life imprisonmentdoes not militate against this interpretation, for the danger of a forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the distance traversed.  This reading also does not make any other part of 2113s graduated penalty scheme superfluous.  Pp.25.

A bank robber forces [a] person to accompany him, for purposes of section 2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance. The word accompany does not connote movement over a substantial distance.
