    <p>Brief_Case is a summarizer built on top of the Gensim library to snip out the best parts of a case that would be relevant for legal professionals. Brief_Case highlights the IRAC sections of a case and returns the most important snippets so you don't have to dig through the procedural history, dicta, and other tangential parts.</p>
